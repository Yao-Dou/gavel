The task is to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the documents. The user has provided a snapshot with 10 documents, all unvisited. The checklist item is about the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into court orders.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain this information. The key here is that settlement durations are typically in settlement agreements or notices, not in court orders. Looking at the document list, the \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\" seems like the most relevant. That's a pleading or motion that would detail settlement terms, including duration.\n\nThe other documents like Complaint, Dockets, and Orders (001-005) are more about court proceedings or orders, which the checklist specifies to exclude. The \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" might mention settlement details, but the checklist says to exclude anything incorporated into a court order. So that's probably not the right place. The Joint Notice is the best bet.\n\nSo, I should read that specific document. Since it's unvisited, I'll use read_document on \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\" with the full token range. But wait, the document has 1,832 tokens, which is under 10,000, so reading the whole thing is okay. The parameters need start_token and end_token. Since it's unvisited, start is 0, end is the total tokens (1832). \n\nWait, the document catalog shows it as 1,832 tokens. So start_token=0, end_token=1832. That should get the entire document. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other documents. The Dockets might have mentions, but the Joint Notice is the most directly related. Using search_document_regex might be overkill here since the document name suggests it's the right one. So reading the document directly makes sense.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex unless the pattern is clear. Here, the document name points to the right place, so read_document is better. Also, the user's instructions say to read a targeted window if the document is likely to contain the target. So the next action is read_document for that specific file.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1832}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1832}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3452, "completion_tokens": 546, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents, specifically the checklist item \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\". The user provided a snapshot of the current state, and I need to figure out the next action.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was reading the Joint Notice document (tokens 0-1832), which is now fully visited. The content of that document mentions a 60-day stipulation for status reports during the stay. The key phrase is \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay.\" \n\nWait, the checklist item is about the settlement duration, not the status report intervals. The settlement duration here refers to how long the settlement obligations last. The document says the parties will file status reports every 60 days until the settlements are finalized, but that's not the settlement duration itself. The settlement duration would be the time period after the settlement is approved, but the document doesn't specify that. The notice is about staying the litigation deadlines pending settlement finalization, not the duration of the settlement terms.\n\nSo, in the current document, there's no explicit mention of the settlement duration. The 60-day part is about the status reports, not the settlement period. Therefore, this document doesn't contain the required value. \n\nThe next step would be to check other documents. The available documents include other orders and the Complaint. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims might have the settlement terms, but it's currently unvisited. The Order (001) and others might also contain relevant info.\n\nSince the current document (Joint Notice) doesn't have the value, I should look for other documents. The next logical step is to read another document that's likely to contain settlement terms. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims (832 tokens) is a good candidate because it's related to settlement approval. Also, the Complaint might have settlement terms, but it's longer (42k tokens), so maybe start with the shorter ones.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows that Order Approving Settlements is unvisited. The next action should be to read that document. But the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited docs. The Joint Notice is fully visited, so we need to pick another. The Order Approving Settlements is a short document (832 tokens), so reading it in one go is feasible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for phrases like \"settlement duration\" or \"duration of settlement\" across documents. But the checklist item specifies to extract the duration as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\", so perhaps the exact wording might be in the documents. However, the regex might not be precise. Since the Order Approving Settlements is a relevant document, maybe read that first.\n\nWait, the current status shows that \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" is empty. The Joint Notice didn't provide the value, so need to check other documents. The next step is to read a document that's likely to have the settlement duration. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims is a good candidate. So the action should be read_document on that order.\n\nCheck the document catalog: Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims is ○ Unvisited, 832 tokens. So reading the whole document (since it's under 10k tokens) is possible. The start_token would be 0, end_token 832.\n\nSo the next action is read_document with doc_name \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" from 0-832.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors\\u2019 Claims\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 832}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 832}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5671, "completion_tokens": 829, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from legal documents. So far, they've read two documents: the Joint Notice and the Order Approving Settlements. \n\nLooking at the Joint Notice (tokens 0-1832), the key part is paragraph 14: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay.\" This mentions a 60-day reporting period, but the settlement duration itself isn't explicitly stated. The settlement is conditional and pending finalization, so the actual duration might be in the Order.\n\nIn the Order (tokens 0-832), section 3 says: \"The Court approves placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" This indicates the settlement obligations last until the minors reach those ages. So the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" for the trusts.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says to extract \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods.\" The trust period is part of the settlement, so \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" should be the value. But the Order doesn't specify a fixed term like \"5 years\" – it's age-based. The Joint Notice's 60-day reports are a monitoring period, but that's separate from the settlement duration. The settlement itself (the trust) lasts until the minors' ages.\n\nSo the key value here is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" with evidence from the Order. Need to format it as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". The duration here is the age-based period, so \"until age 18, 21, or 25\".\n\nCheck if there's more in other documents. The other 8 documents are unvisited, but the Order already provides the settlement duration. The Joint Notice mentions the stay but not the settlement duration. The Order is the one that specifies the trust duration. So the value is in the Order.\n\nSince the Order is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and we've found the value, the next step is to append this to the checklist. The evidence should include the exact text from the Order. The location is Page 2, lines 10-11. The document name is \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\".\n\nWait, the Order's text says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\". The checklist requires formatting as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So the value would be \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\".\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [settlement obligation].'\" So the duration part is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\", and the settlement obligation is the trust placement. So the full value should be \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\".\n\nNow, check if this is the only value. The Joint Notice doesn't have the duration, only the monitoring period (60 days). The monitoring period isn't the settlement duration itself, so it shouldn't be included. The settlement duration is the trust period.\n\nSo the extracted value is one entry. Need to use append_checklist to add it. The evidence must have the text, source document, and location.\n\nThe text snippet is: \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" from the Order. Location is Page 2 of the Order.\n\nWait, the Order's page 2, line 10: \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So location can be \"Page 2, lines 10-11\".\n\nSo the evidence should include:\n- text: \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\"\n- source_document: \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\"\n- location: \"Page 2, lines 10-11\"\n\nAnd the value is \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\" but wait, the checklist says to format as [duration]: [settlement obligation]. So the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" and the settlement obligation is \"placement into pooled minors’ trusts\".\n\nSo the value should be \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\".\n\nBut in the Order, the exact text is \"placement of ... into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So the duration is the \"until they reach...\" part, and the obligation is the placement.\n\nThus, the value is correctly formatted as \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\".\n\nNow, since the Order is fully visited and we've found this value, the next action is to append it using append_checklist. We don't need to use update_checklist here because it's the first value and we're appending.\n\nCheck if there are other documents that might have more values. The other documents are unvisited, but the Order already provides the settlement duration. The Joint Notice doesn't have it. The other orders might have different settlements, but since the user's current documents show this as the only one found, and the task is to extract all, but the Order is the only one with the settlement duration specified. So proceed to append this one value.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", extracted array containing the one entry with the value and evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\", \"source_document\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\", \"location\": \"Page 2, lines 10-11\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts", "evidence": [{"text": "until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.", "source_document": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "location": "Page 2, lines 10-11"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6708, "completion_tokens": 1443, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which needs to capture the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one value from the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" document. The value is \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement into pooled minors’ trusts\" with evidence from page 2, lines 10-11. The key is marked as having 1 value out of 1, so it's filled. But wait, the task says to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" found in any document. The current extraction only has one value. However, the user might have missed other documents that could have more details.\n\nThe available documents show that 8 out of 10 are unvisited (Complaint, Dockets 001-002, Orders 001-005). But the checklist item is about settlement duration. The Joint Notice and the Order Approving Settlements were already read. The Joint Notice mentioned a 60-day status report stipulation (step 14), but that's a reporting period, not the settlement duration itself. The Order Approving Settlements has the main duration (until age 18,21,25). \n\nWait, the Joint Notice says: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay.\" But the stay is pending settlement finalization, not the settlement duration. The actual settlement duration is in the Order, which is already extracted. The other documents might not have relevant info. The Complaint is the initial filing, probably doesn't have settlement terms. Dockets might have event dates but not the duration. The other Orders (001-005) could be related, but the user hasn't read them yet.\n\nBut the task is to extract \"every distinct value\". The current extraction has one value. To confirm if there are more, they need to check other documents. However, the problem states that settlement duration should be \"not incorporated into a court order\". The Order Approving Settlements is a court order, so the settlement terms within it might be considered incorporated. Wait, the checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" Hmm, the Order Approving Settlements is a court order, so the settlement terms in it (the trust placement) might be excluded. But the Order is approving the settlement, so the settlement terms are part of the court order. Wait, the checklist says to exclude settlements incorporated into court orders. So maybe the value extracted from the Order is invalid because it's part of a court order.\n\nWait, the user's Step 4 appended the value from the Order. But according to the checklist, if the settlement is incorporated into a court order, it shouldn't be included. The Order Approving Settlements is the court order that approves the settlement, so the settlement terms (like the trusts) are part of the order. Therefore, that value shouldn't be included. But the user already appended it. Now, the task is to correct that.\n\nWait, but the user's current status shows the key as filled. However, the evidence might be invalid. The checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The Order Approving Settlements is a court order, so the settlement terms within it (the trust duration) are part of the court order, thus they should be excluded. Therefore, the extracted value is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct action would be to remove that value and set the key to Not Applicable, or find another document where the settlement duration is not part of a court order. But the Joint Notice is a settlement notice, not a court order. Let me check the Joint Notice again.\n\nIn the Joint Notice (Step 2), they mention \"the Parties have reached conditional settlements... subject to finalizing written settlement agreements...\". The duration mentioned there is the 60-day status reports, but that's a stay period, not the settlement duration. The actual settlement duration (the trust terms) is in the Order, which is a court order. So perhaps there are no valid entries for this checklist item, because all settlement terms are incorporated into the court order. Therefore, the key should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 4 already appended a value. Now, based on the checklist definition, that value is invalid. So the correct action is to update the checklist to set How_Long_Settlement_will_Last to Not Applicable, since the only value found was from a court order, which is excluded.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. The checklist says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The Order Approving Settlements is a court order, so the settlement terms there are incorporated. Therefore, the value should not be included. So the correct state is that the key should be Not Applicable.\n\nThe current extracted value is invalid. So the next step is to use update_checklist to replace the existing value with \"Not Applicable\". The evidence for Not Applicable would be the fact that all settlement terms are part of a court order, so there's no settlement duration outside of court orders.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Joint Notice mentions the settlement but doesn't state the duration (only the stay period). The Order Approving Settlements includes the duration but as part of the court order. So there's no valid entry. Therefore, the key should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next action should be update_checklist for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence stating that all settlement terms are incorporated into court orders.\n\nWait, the user's current state shows the key as filled with one value. But according to the checklist definition, that value shouldn't be included. So the assistant needs to correct that by updating the key to Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call update_checklist with the key How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, extracted list containing one entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence that the settlement terms are part of the court order (e.g., \"The settlement terms are incorporated into the Court's Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims (Document 470), thus excluded per checklist definition.\").\n\nSo, the JSON should be an update_checklist call with the patch for that key.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"The Court approves the Settlements of the claims of minor Plaintiffs B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A. in this Lawsuit.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2, line 25\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"The Court approves placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2, lines 10-11\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "The Court approves the Settlements of the claims of minor Plaintiffs B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A. in this Lawsuit.", "source_document": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "location": "Page 2, line 25"}, {"text": "The Court approves placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.", "source_document": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "location": "Page 2, lines 10-11"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6855, "completion_tokens": 1613, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The evidence given in Step 5's update was the court's approval of the settlements (which are part of the court order), so that's correct. The checklist says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" Since the settlement terms here are in the court order, they shouldn't be included, hence Not Applicable.\n\nNow, the current status shows \"Not Applicable\": 1/1. The task is to extract the settlement duration, but since all relevant terms are in court orders, there's nothing to extract.

The system's automatic review after the first stop shows that all keys are either filled or marked Not Applicable. The checklist status says 1/1 filled, 0 empty, and 1/1 Not Applicable.\n\nNow, checking the available documents: the two documents already read (Order Approving Settlements and Joint Notice) are fully visited. The other 8 documents are unvisited, but the checklist definition requires that settlement durations not be part of court orders. The Order Approving Settlements is a court order, so any other orders (like Order 001-005) would likely have similar court-ordered terms. The Joint Notice was a conditional settlement, but the prior step showed it was fully visited and didn't contain the required info.\n\nThe user's step 5 update to Not Applicable was correct because the evidence (lines 10-11) shows the terms were court-ordered. The system's automatic checklist review confirms this. Since all documents that might contain settlement terms are either court orders (which are excluded) or unvisited but unlikely to contain non-court settlement terms (as the Joint Notice was fully read and didn't have it), there's no need to read more documents.\n\nThe stop criteria require all keys to be complete or Not Applicable. Here, the only key is marked Not Applicable with proper evidence. The user tried to stop once (step 6), but the system required a second stop attempt. Since the current state matches the stop criteria, the correct action is to stop again with the reason that the item is Not Applicable per the checklist definition.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are properly marked as Not Applicable with valid evidence.
