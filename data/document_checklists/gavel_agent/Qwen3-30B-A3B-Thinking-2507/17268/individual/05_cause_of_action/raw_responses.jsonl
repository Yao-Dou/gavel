The keys with values are 0 out of 1, and Cause_of_Action is empty. The next step is to figure out which document to read first. The Complaint is the most likely place to find the cause of action since it's where the plaintiff states their legal claims. The Complaint document has 42,744 tokens, which is a lot, but I can't read the whole thing at once. The maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens per read_document call. So I should start with the beginning of the Complaint to find where the causes of action are listed.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not rereading any documents, and since it's unvisited, I can start from the beginning. The first 10,000 tokens should cover the initial parts of the complaint, which often include the causes of action. So the next action should be to read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document.

The user needs me to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from the legal documents. The checklist definition says to look for the legal vehicle used to bring the claims, like statutes or judge-made vehicles, not the underlying rights or remedies.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first document they read was the Complaint (tokens 0-10000). In the Complaint, on page 5, paragraph 6, it says: \"The government’s family separation policy was cruel and inhumane, and it was unlawful. The United States is liable for the conduct which harmed Plaintiffs under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b)(1), 2671, et seq. (“FTCA”).\"\n\nSo the cause of action here is the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), specifically citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b)(1), 2671, et seq. The checklist says to extract the legal vehicle, so FTCA is the key part. The citation is part of the evidence, but the cause of action is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\".\n\nI need to make sure this is the only cause of action mentioned. The rest of the document talks about the facts and other legal points, but this is the only mention of the cause. The user's instructions say to extract every distinct value, so if FTCA is the only one, that's it.\n\nThe next step is to append this to the checklist. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be page 5, as it's mentioned in the document's page numbers. The tokens read were up to 10,000, which includes this part.\n\nWait, the document says \"Case 2:19-cv-05217-SRB Document 1 Filed 09/19/19 Page 5 of 77\" so the text is on page 5. The exact quote is \"Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b)(1), 2671, et seq. (“FTCA”).\"\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" (FTCA is the acronym, but the full name is what's needed). The evidence should have the text snippet, source document \"Complaint\", and location \"Page 5\".\n\nSince this is the first value found, I should use append_checklist to add this. The checklist item is Cause_of_Action, and the extracted list will have this entry. Need to make sure the evidence includes the exact text, source, and location.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, but the Complaint is partially visited (only up to 10k tokens), but the relevant part is in the first 10k, so it's covered.

The next step is to check other documents since the Complaint was only partially read (23% coverage). The available documents include other dockets, orders, and motions. The user needs to find if any of these mention other causes of action, like Bivens or other statutes.\n\nThe previous action was `append_checklist` for Cause_of_Action. Now, the next logical step is to read more of the Complaint to see if there's another mention of a cause of action. Wait, but the Complaint was read up to 10,000 tokens, which is 23% of 42k tokens. Maybe the rest of the document has more. However, the user should check if other documents might have additional causes. But the Complaint is the main document, so maybe continue reading it.\n\nWait, the snapshot shows that the Complaint is partially visited (0-10000 tokens).

However, the other documents are dockets or orders, which might not contain the cause of action, which is usually in the complaint.

The next step is to check if there are more values in the remaining parts of the Complaint or other documents. The Complaint is partially visited (tokens 0-20,000 out of 42,744), so there's still more to read. The other documents are unvisited, but the main complaint might have more mentions of the cause of action.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says to extract every distinct value. The current extraction has \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" but maybe there are others. Let me check the provided text again. The Complaint mentions \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" in paragraph 6, but I need to see if there are other causes mentioned elsewhere in the document.\n\nLooking through the text, the complaint also refers to the FTCA (Federal Tort Claims Act) in paragraph 6. Are there other causes mentioned? Let me check the rest of the document. The text continues with other sections like jurisdiction, parties, facts, etc., but I don't see other statutory causes of action mentioned. The complaint is based on FTCA, so maybe that's the only one.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says not to include underlying rights or remedies. The FTCA is the cause of action here. The complaint also references other cases like Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but those are case names, not causes of action. So probably only one value.\n\nHowever, the current extraction shows one value, but maybe there's another mention in the remaining tokens of the Complaint. The document has 42,744 tokens, and they've read up to 20,000. So there's still 22,744 tokens left. Maybe there's another reference.\n\nAlternatively, check if other documents might have different causes of action. But the task is to extract all distinct values from any document. However, the complaint is the main document here, and it's possible that the other documents (like Dockets, Orders) might not have additional causes of action. But since the system hasn't read them yet, maybe they could have more info.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract all distinct values. If the complaint only has one, and the other documents don't have any, then it's done. But the current status shows one value, and the system needs to confirm if there are more.\n\nThe next step should be to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint to check for additional mentions of the cause of action. Since the Complaint is partially visited, the next logical step is to read the next window of tokens (e.g., 20,000-30,000) to see if there's more.\n\nThe user's previous action was reading tokens 10,000-20,000. The next would be tokens 20,000-30,000, which is within the 10,000 token limit. So the correct action here is to call `read_document` on the Complaint for tokens 20,000-30,000. That way, they can check the remaining part of the complaint for any other mentions of the cause of action.\n\nWait, the document says \"Viewed tokens: 0-20000 (47% coverage)\", so the next segment would be 20,000-30,000. But the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens, so 20k-30k is acceptable. So the next action should be `read_document` with doc_name \"Complaint\", start_token 20000, end_token 30000.\n\nAlternatively, check if the cause of action is mentioned again. But since the complaint is focused on FTCA, it's unlikely, but possible. The system should check the remaining text to be thorough.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the other documents like the Orders or Dockets mention other causes of action. But given the context, the complaint is the primary document for the cause of action. The Dockets might have procedural info, but not the cause of action. The Orders might reference the cause, but it's less likely. However, the system should check the remaining part of the complaint first before moving to other documents.\n\nSo, the correct next action is to read the next segment of the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 20000, \"end_token\": 30000}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 20000, "end_token": 30000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 26370, "completion_tokens": 1038, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The next step would be to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint to see if there are more instances of Cause_of_Action.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Complaint is partially visited with tokens 0-30000 viewed, so the next part to read is tokens 30000-42744. The maximum allowed per call is 10,000 tokens, so splitting into two reads might be needed. But since the next token range is 30000-42744 (12,744 tokens), which exceeds 10,000, I should read 30000-40000 first, then 40000-42744.\n\nBut the task says to read ≤10,000 tokens per call.

The user needs to check if there are any other instances of the cause of action in the remaining documents or in the remaining parts of the Complaint.\n\nThe Complaint document is partially visited (viewed tokens 0-40000), but the document is 42,744 tokens. So there's a small part left (40000-42744). However, in the previous steps, they read up to token 30000-40000 in Step 6, which covers up to token 40000. The remaining tokens would be 40000-42744, which is about 2744 tokens. Since the maximum per read is 10,000, but this is less than that, maybe they should read the remaining tokens of the Complaint to check for more causes.\n\nBut wait, the Complaint was read in chunks: Step 2 (0-10000), Step 4 (10000-20000), Step 5 (20000-30000), Step 6 (30000-40000).

But the current status shows that the Complaint has the only value so far. The user needs to check if there are other documents that might have the cause of action.\n\nBut the next step should be to either read the remaining part of the Complaint or check other documents. However, the Complaint's remaining tokens (40000-42744) are only about 2744 tokens, which is less than 10,000, so they could read it. But the evidence they found is already from the first part. Let me check the text they read in Step 6 (tokens 30000-40000). The last line was about V.C. and G.A.'s reunification, but the cause of action was already mentioned earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents (like Orders) might mention the cause of action. For example, an order might state the cause. But the user hasn't read those yet. However, the current step requires choosing one action. The available documents are mostly unvisited, but the checklist item might only be in the Complaint.\n\nWait, the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", and the extraction progress shows that Cause_of_Action has 1 value. The user needs to confirm if there are more values. Since the Complaint is the main pleading, and the cause is stated there, it's possible that's the only one. But to be thorough, they should check if other documents have the cause.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\" So they should first finish reading the current document (Complaint) to ensure no more causes are there.\n\nThe Complaint's remaining tokens are 40000-42744. Let's check the document's token count: 42,744 tokens. They've read up to 40,000, so 2,744 tokens left. They should read that to make sure there's no additional mention of the cause of action.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on Complaint with tokens 40000-42744. After that, they can check if there's more evidence. If not, they can stop or check other documents.

The other documents are unvisited. The next step is to check if there are more values in other documents.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract the legal vehicle used to bring claims, like statutes or judge-made causes. The current extracted value is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\", which is a statute. But maybe other documents mention other causes, like constitutional claims or other statutes.\n\nI should check if other documents might have more causes. The available documents include Dockets, Orders, and a Settlement Order. Orders might reference legal bases, like the Ms. L. case which mentions the Fifth Amendment. Wait, but the checklist says not to include underlying rights (like constitutional amendments), so Fifth Amendment isn't a cause of action here—it's the underlying right. The actual cause might be something like \"substantive due process\" as part of the claim.\n\nWait, in the Complaint, they mention \"the government instituted and implemented this policy to intentionally inflict emotional distress on the parents and children whom it separated. It succeeded, with devastating consequences for Plaintiffs.\" And in Count I, they cite \"Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\" under the FTCA. So the cause is FTCA, which is already extracted.\n\nBut maybe other orders or pleadings mention other causes. For example, the Order (001) or (002) might reference other legal bases. However, since those documents are unvisited, I need to check them.\n\nThe user's task is to extract ALL distinct values. So far, only FTCA is found. But maybe other documents have more. Let me think about the other documents:\n\n- Docket (001) and (002) might have case numbers, but not sure about legal causes.\n- Orders (001-005) might have the court's reasoning, which could mention the legal basis. For example, the Ms. L. case (mentioned in the Complaint) might have an order that references the cause of action as \"substantive due process\" under the Fifth Amendment. But according to the checklist, we shouldn't include the underlying right (Fifth Amendment), but the cause of action might be \"substantive due process\" as the legal vehicle. Wait, the checklist says \"judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens)\" so Bivens is a cause, but substantive due process isn't a statute—it's a doctrine. Wait, the example says \"Bivens\" is a judge-made vehicle, so maybe \"substantive due process\" is the cause here. But the instructions say not to include underlying rights, so Fifth Amendment is the right, but the cause might be the claim based on that right.\n\nWait, the checklist example says \"e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA\" so those are statutory. Bivens is a judge-made cause. So if an order says \"the court found that the claim was brought under Bivens\", then \"Bivens\" would be a cause. But in the Complaint, they're using FTCA.\n\nThe current extracted value is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\", which is correct. Now, need to check if other documents have other causes. For example, the Order (001) might mention \"Bivens\" or another statute.\n\nSince the other documents are unvisited, the next logical step is to read one of them. But which one? The Orders might be more likely to mention the legal causes. The Order (001) is 2,206 tokens, which is small, so it's safe to read. Alternatively, use search_document_regex to look for keywords like \"cause of action\", \"statute\", \"Bivens\", etc.\n\nWait, the user's previous steps have been reading the Complaint. Now, since the Complaint is fully read, and other documents are unvisited, the next action should be to either read another document or search. But the checklist requires all values, so if there's another cause in another document, need to find it.\n\nThe problem is, the user's current status shows only one value. To confirm if there are more, need to check other documents. The most efficient way is to use search_document_regex on all documents for patterns related to causes of action.\n\nLooking at the tools, search_document_regex can search all documents. The pattern could be something like \"cause of action|statute|Bivens|FTCA|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA\". But the user should use precise patterns. Since the existing value is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\", maybe the pattern should look for other statutory references.\n\nBut the checklist says to extract distinct values. So the regex should look for the exact cause names. However, searching for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" might not find it again, but other causes like \"Bivens\" might be in the documents.\n\nAlternatively, since the Complaint already has FTCA, and other documents might have other causes, the next step is to search all documents for the term \"cause of action\" to find where they're mentioned.\n\nWait, but the user's task is to extract the cause of action, so the documents might mention it in the body. The Orders might cite the legal basis. For example, the Order (001) might state \"the court finds that the cause of action is under the FTCA and Bivens\".\n\nSo, using search_document_regex with pattern \"cause of action|Bivens|FTCA|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA\" could find where these are mentioned.\n\nBut the user should be precise. Let's check the available documents. The Order (001) is the shortest, so maybe start with that, but the system says to use search_document_regex to jump to likely sections.\n\nThe correct action here is to use search_document_regex on all documents to find mentions of possible causes. The pattern should be a regex that matches the known cause (FTCA) and other possible ones. But since the user needs to find all, using a pattern like \"(Federal Tort Claims Act|Bivens|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA)\" would search for those.\n\nBut the existing value is FTCA, so maybe there's another cause. Let's see the complaint: they mention \"Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" and \"substantive due process\" in the context of the Fifth Amendment. But the checklist says not to include underlying rights, so \"Fifth Amendment\" is out, but \"substantive due process\" might be the cause. However, the example says \"judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens)\", so \"substantive due process\" is a judge-made cause. Wait, Bivens is a specific case, but substantive due process is a broader doctrine. The checklist example includes \"Bivens\", so maybe \"substantive due process\" is a valid cause here.\n\nIn the Complaint, paragraph 68 says \"the government’s policy of separating children... violated the constitutional right to family integrity... including Plaintiffs. See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enf’t, 302 F. Supp. 3d 1149, 1161-67 (S.D. Cal. 2018)...\". So the case is about substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment. But the cause of action would be \"substantive due process\" as the legal vehicle, not the Fifth Amendment itself.\n\nSo, if the Orders mention \"substantive due process\" as the cause, that's another value. But the current extracted value is only FTCA. So need to check other documents for \"substantive due process\" or \"Bivens\".\n\nTherefore, the next step is to search all documents for these terms. Using search_document_regex with pattern \"substantive due process|Bivens\" to find if other causes exist.\n\nWait, but the user should check if any of the other documents have this. The Order (001) might be the one with the court's reasoning. So using search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"substantive due process\" would be good.\n\nSo the action should be to call search_document_regex with doc_name='all', pattern='substantive due process|Bivens', and maybe other terms.\n\nBut the user needs to be precise. Let's check the exact pattern. The regex should match the phrases. So the pattern could be \"(substantive due process|Bivens)\".\n\nAlso, the checklist says to extract the cause of action, so even if the Order says \"the claim was brought under substantive due process\", that's a valid entry.\n\nSo the next action is to search all documents for these terms. Therefore, the correct function call is search_document_regex with pattern \"substantive due process|Bivens\".\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"all\", \"pattern\": \"substantive due process|Bivens|Federal Tort Claims Act|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "substantive due process|Bivens|Federal Tort Claims Act|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 41469, "completion_tokens": 2032, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from the legal documents. The checklist definition says to extract the legal vehicle used to bring the claims, like statutes or judge-made causes, not underlying rights or remedies.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the Complaint is fully visited (tokens 0-42744). The prior steps have already extracted one value for Cause_of_Action from the Complaint. The user's recent actions show that Step 3 was an append_checklist with one value. Then Steps 4-8 read more of the Complaint and did a regex search.\n\nThe regex search was done with patterns like \"substantive due process|Bivens|Federal Tort Claims Act|42 U.S.C. § 1983|Title II of the ADA\". The matches found in the Complaint and other documents include mentions of \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" and \"substantive due process\".\n\nWait, the Complaint mentions \"Count I: INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS\" and \"Count II: NEGLIGENCE\" under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The FTCA is a statutory cause of action. The regex search found \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" in the Docket (001) and the Joint Notice.\n\nThe checklist says to extract the legal vehicle, so FTCA (28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq.) is a cause of action here. The Complaint's Prayer for Relief mentions FTCA as the basis for liability. So \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" is the cause of action.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value extracted. But the regex search found more mentions. Wait, the prior append_checklist only added one value. The regex search in Step 8 found matches, but the next step should be to process those matches.\n\nThe regex search on all documents found 8 matches. The Complaint had 3 matches, Docket (001) had one with \"Cause: 28:2671 Federal Tort Claims Act\", and the Joint Notice had \"under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2671, et seq.\".\n\nSo the Cause_of_Action should be \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" (FTCA). The prior extraction might have missed the specific statutory reference, but the value is the same. The checklist says to extract the legal vehicle, so \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" is the value. The statutory citation (28 U.S.C. § 2671) is part of it, but the value is the name of the cause.\n\nThe current extracted value is probably \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" from the Complaint. The regex search confirms it in multiple documents. Since the Complaint is fully read, and the regex matches confirm the cause, the extraction is complete. The checklist has one key, and it's filled. So the next step should be to stop.\n\nWait, the Current Status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 1\". So all keys are filled. The next action is to stop. But the user needs to confirm that the extracted value is correct.\n\nThe prior append_checklist (Step 3) added one value. The regex search (Step 8) found more references, but since it's the same cause, it's not a new value. The checklist says to deduplicate, so only one entry is needed. Therefore, all required values are extracted, and the key is filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.

The user is trying to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from legal documents. So far, they've read the Complaint document in chunks and used a regex search to find relevant terms.\n\nLooking at the current status: The checklist item \"Cause_of_Action\" has one value extracted, which is \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" based on matches in the Complaint and Docket (001). The system says it's fully extracted, but wait—the user's step 9 called `stop`, but then the system automatically ran `get_checklist` and showed that it's 1/1 filled. However, the task requires extracting every distinct value. The regex search found \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" in multiple places, but maybe there are other causes of action mentioned.\n\nWait, the Complaint mentions \"COUNT I: INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS\" and \"COUNT II: NEGLIGENCE\", but the checklist definition says not to include remedies (like damages) or procedural doctrines. The legal vehicle here is the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which is the statute enabling the claims. The FTCA is the cause of action, not the counts (which are the specific claims under FTCA).\n\nThe regex search also found \"28 U.S.C. § 2671\" in the Docket, which is part of the FTCA. The system's step 9 says it's extracted as 'Federal Tort Claims Act', which is correct. But the checklist says to extract the legal vehicle, like statutes or judge-made vehicles. FTCA is a statute, so that's correct.\n\nWait, the user's step 8's regex search included patterns like \"Federal Tort Claims Act\", so they found matches. The evidence from the Complaint (tokens 15729-15929) says \"Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the United States is liable...\" and Docket (001) mentions \"Cause: 28:2671 Federal Tort Claims Act\". So that's solid.\n\nBut the checklist says to extract every distinct value. Is there another cause of action? For example, in the Complaint, there's \"28 U.S.C. § 2671\" and \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" as the same thing. The regex also looked for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but didn't find it. The matches only had FTCA. So only one distinct value.\n\nThe system shows \"Cause_of_Action\" has one value. The user's step 9 called stop, but the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\". The automatic checklist review after stop shows it's 1/1 filled. So the correct action now is to stop again because all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key, and it's done.\n\nWait, the user's step 9 already called stop, but the system is prompting for another action. The instructions say to stop when all keys are filled. Since the checklist status is 1/1 filled, the next step should be to stop. The system's \"Your decision now\" says to call stop again as the second attempt. So the correct action is to return the stop JSON.\n\nDouble-checking: The checklist item \"Cause_of_Action\" is correctly extracted as \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" with evidence from multiple documents. No other causes of action are present in the documents. The regex didn't find other patterns like \"Bivens\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", so no other values. Therefore, it's complete.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted.
