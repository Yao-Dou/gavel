The government\u2019s policy of forcibly taking children from their parents caused extraordinary trauma to thousands of families, including Plaintiffs\u2014five mothers and their respective five children, who at the time of separation were between five and twelve years old, and who were separated for months. The trauma suffered by Plaintiffs and other parents and children was no incidental byproduct of the policy. It was the very point. The government sought to inflict emotional distress in order to deter parents and children from seeking asylum in this country."
