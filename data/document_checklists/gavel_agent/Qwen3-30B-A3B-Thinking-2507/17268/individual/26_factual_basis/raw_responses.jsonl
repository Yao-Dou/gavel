Since there are no documents listed, I need to figure out what's available. The system hasn't found any documents yet, so the next logical step is to list them. The user can't read or search documents if there are none. So the correct action here is to call list_documents to get the catalog. That's the first step before anything else. Let me check the tools again. Yes, list_documents is the function to use when the catalog is unknown.

The Complaint is usually where the plaintiff states the facts of the case, so that's a good starting point. The Complaint document has 42,744 tokens, but the maximum read per call is 10,000 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I need to read a portion of it.\n\nI should call read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That's the first step.

Let me confirm: the Complaint is the initial pleading where the plaintiff outlines the facts, so it's the best place to start.\n\nNo need for regex search here because the factual basis is likely in the body of the Complaint, not a specific pattern.

The user wants me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the Complaint document has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), and the current status is that no values have been extracted yet.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text provided, the first few pages talk about the case details, the plaintiffs, and the introduction. The key part for factual basis is in the \"INTRODUCTION\" and \"STATEMENT OF FACTS\" sections. \n\nIn the Introduction (Page 3), paragraph 1 mentions the policy of separating asylum-seeking parents from children, causing trauma. Paragraph 2 states that officials intended to use trauma to deter future asylum seekers. There's a reference to Trump's tweet about separation deterring people. \n\nThen, in the Statement of Facts (starting on Page 8), there's more detail about the policy development, the memo from December 2017, the Zero Tolerance policy announcement, and specific examples of officials' statements. The facts include the number of children separated (3,800+), the duration of separations (months), and the government's intent to deter immigration through trauma.\n\nThe evidence for the factual basis should be the specific details from the document. Each unique fact needs a separate entry with evidence. For example, the policy's purpose, the number of separations, the officials' statements, and the trauma caused.\n\nThe user's checklist requires every distinct value. So I need to extract each unique fact with its supporting evidence. The Complaint document has enough text to start extracting these. Since the document is partially visited (only up to token 10000), but the relevant sections are in the first part, I can proceed to extract the facts from the read portion.\n\nI should use append_checklist to add these entries. Each entry needs the value (the fact), evidence (verbatim text, source, location). The location can be page numbers as per the document's page numbers shown (e.g., Page 3, Page 8).\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each extracted entry must have text, source_document, location. The source is \"Complaint\", location is the page numbers mentioned.\n\nLet me list possible entries:\n\n1. Value: \"Policy of forcibly separating asylum-seeking parents from their children to cause trauma and deter future asylum seekers.\"\n   Evidence: \"This matter concerns an unprecedented policy issued at the highest levels of the federal government to separate asylum-seeking parents from their children. The government’s policy of forcibly taking children from their parents caused extraordinary trauma to thousands of families, including Plaintiffs—five mothers and their respective five children... It was the very point. The government sought to inflict emotional distress in order to deter parents and children from seeking asylum in this country.\"\n   Source: Complaint, Page 3.\n\n2. Value: \"Government acknowledged separating at least 3,800 children from parents after crossing the border.\"\n   Evidence: \"In total, the government has acknowledged that it has separated at least 3,800 children from their parents or guardians after they crossed the southwestern U.S. border.\"\n   Source: Complaint, Page 4.\n\n3. Value: \"Federal officials publicly stated the policy's purpose was deterrence, including Trump's tweet: 'If you don’t separate, FAR more people will come.'\"\n   Evidence: \"President Trump has continued to defend the policy as a deterrent to migration from Central America, such as when he tweeted, “[I]f you don’t separate, FAR more people will come.”\"\n   Source: Complaint, Page 4.\n\n4. Value: \"Officials intended to use trauma from separations to deter future asylum seekers, as per the December 2017 memo.\"\n   Evidence: \"The memorandum asserted that 'the increase in prosecutions would be reported by media and it would have substantial deterrent effect.'\"\n   Source: Complaint, Page 10.\n\n5. Value: \"Children were separated for months, with limited communication and tracking, causing ongoing trauma.\"\n   Evidence: \"Each family remained separated for more than two months. Throughout that time, the government provided only limited information to each mother about her child’s whereabouts and well-being and afforded only minimal opportunities for each mother and child to communicate...\"\n   Source: Complaint, Page 5.\n\nEach of these is a distinct factual basis element. I need to append them as separate entries under Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nCheck if any of these are already in the checklist. The current status shows 0 values, so all are new. Use append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted array with each entry's evidence.\n\nMake sure each evidence entry has text, source_document, location. The location can be \"Page 3\" as per the document's page numbers. The source is \"Complaint\" as per the document name.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist should have a patch with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and extracted array of the five entries. Each extracted entry has evidence array with text, source_document, location.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Policy of forcibly separating asylum-seeking parents from children to cause trauma and deter future asylum seekers\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This matter concerns an unprecedented policy issued at the highest levels of the federal government to separate asylum-seeking parents from their children.

The user is asking me to extract the Factual_Basis_of_Case from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that Step 3 already appended 5 values from the Complaint document. The current status says all 1 key has 5 values extracted, and the documents in the corpus include 10, but only Complaint is partially visited (23% coverage).\n\nWait, the Complaint document has 42,744 tokens, and they read 0-10,000 (23%). The next step would be to check if there are more relevant information in the remaining tokens of the Complaint. But the user's task is to extract ALL distinct values. The previous extraction covered pages 1-17, but the Complaint is 77 pages. However, the evidence provided in the append_checklist seems to cover the main points from the first 17 pages. But maybe there's more in the later pages.\n\nWait, the snapshot shows that the read_document was from tokens 0-10000, which corresponds to pages 1-17 (since each page is roughly 2500 tokens or so, but the exact token count per page isn't given). The next action should be to read more of the Complaint document to see if there are additional factual bases. But according to the document reading efficiency rules, I shouldn't reread already viewed tokens. The Complaint has been viewed up to 10,000 tokens, so the next unviewed range would be 10,001 to 42,744. However, the maximum per read_document is 10,000 tokens. So I should read from 10,001 to 20,000 tokens next.\n\nBut wait, the checklist item is Factual_Basis_of_Case, and the existing entries are from the first part of the Complaint. The user's instructions say to extract every distinct value. The existing 5 values seem to be the main ones, but maybe there's more in the later parts. However, the document is a Complaint, which typically contains the allegations upfront. The later pages might be the signature block or other formalities, which probably don't contain additional factual basis. But to be thorough, I should check the next token range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents (Dockets, Orders) might have more factual basis info. But the checklist item is about the factual basis of the case, which is usually in the Complaint. The other documents like Dockets or Orders might have procedural info, not the factual basis. So it's more likely that the Complaint contains all the necessary facts.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", and \"Total Values Extracted: 5\". The user's task is to extract all distinct values. Since the Complaint is partially visited (23% coverage), maybe there's more to extract. But the existing 5 values are from the first 17 pages, which is where the factual allegations are typically found. The remaining pages might not have more factual basis, but to be safe, I should read the next chunk of the Complaint.\n\nSo the next action should be to read_document on Complaint, start_token 10001, end_token 20001 (since 10,000 tokens max per call). That way, we cover the next 10k tokens. The current viewed is 0-10000, so next is 10001-20000.\n\nWait, the token count for Complaint is 42,744. So 10001-20000 is a valid range. The tool parameters require start_token inclusive and end_token exclusive, so 10001 to 20001 would be 10,000 tokens. Wait, 20001 - 10001 = 10,000. Yes.\n\nBut the user's recent action was reading 0-10000, so the next should be 10001-20001. However, the document's token count is 42,744, so 20001 is within bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next part of the document doesn't have more factual basis. But according to the systematic process, after reading, I need to check if there are more values. So the next step is to read the next token range.\n\nThe other option is to use get_checklist to verify if all values are extracted, but the current status shows 5 values, and the checklist item is fully extracted. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are more values in other documents, I need to check them. But the other documents (Dockets, Orders) are less likely to contain the factual basis. For example, Dockets might list the case numbers, dates, etc., but not the facts of the case. The factual basis is in the Complaint.\n\nSo the most efficient next step is to read the next part of the Complaint. Therefore, the correct action is to call read_document on Complaint with start_token 10001 and end_token 20001.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 20001}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 20001}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15226, "completion_tokens": 1168, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" checklist item from the legal documents provided. So far, they've already read the Complaint document from tokens 0-20001 and appended 5 values for Factual_Basis_of_Case. The current status shows that 1 key (Factual_Basis_of_Case) has 5 values extracted, and all others are empty. But the task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to check if there are more values in the remaining parts of the Complaint or other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is partially visited (tokens 0-20001, 47% coverage). The next step should be to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint to see if there's more evidence for Factual_Basis_of_Case. The token count for Complaint is 42,744, so the next window would be tokens 20001-30001. Since the previous read was up to 20001, reading the next 10,000 tokens makes sense.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Complaint has 42,744 tokens, and they've read up to 20001. So the remaining tokens are 20001-42744. But the maximum read per call is 10,000 tokens, so the next read should be from 20001 to 30001. Then, after that, if needed, read another 10,000 (30001-40001), etc.\n\nBut before that, I should check if the current read (tokens 10001-20001) has more evidence. Wait, the recent action was Step 4: read_document on Complaint tokens 10001-20001. The text provided shows that this section continues from the previous read. The text in Step 4 ends with \"105. On the evening of July 25, 2018...\" So maybe there's more to extract here. But the user's task is to extract all values, so after reading this section, I need to check if there are new values for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nWait, the previous append_checklist (Step 3) had 5 values. The Step 4 read is the next part of the Complaint. So I should check if the new text from 10001-20001 has additional factual basis items. Let me look at the text provided for Step 4.\n\nLooking at the text from tokens 10001-20001, it includes sections about the implementation of the separation policy, the chaos of reunification, and specific cases like C.M. and B.M. For example, paragraphs 70-105 detail the separation of C.M. and B.M., their trauma, the government's failures in tracking, etc. The checklist item \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" includes details of events, evidence, and background. The previous 5 values were about the policy's intent, the number of children separated, Trump's tweet, the December 2017 memo, and the separation duration with limited info.\n\nNow, in the new text, there's more specific evidence: the detailed account of C.M. and B.M.'s separation (paras 70-105), the government's failure to track families (para 56, 57), the EO on June 20, 2018, and the chaotic reunification efforts. For example, paragraph 70-79 describes the forced separation of C.M. and B.M., which is a specific factual basis. Also, paragraphs 56-57 mention the government's failure to have a tracking system, which is part of the factual basis.\n\nWait, but the previous append_checklist already included \"Families separated for months with limited information about children's whereabouts and minimal communication opportunities\" as value 5. The new text might add more specific examples, but the checklist requires distinct values. So if the new text provides additional distinct facts, they should be added. For instance, the specific case of C.M. and B.M. being separated for months with no communication could be a new value, but the previous value 5 already covers that general point. However, the checklist says \"EVERY distinct value,\" so maybe each specific instance counts as a separate value. Wait, no—the checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the document mentions the same fact multiple times, it's still one value. But if different facts are presented, they should be separate entries.\n\nLooking at the new text, the factual basis includes:\n\n- Specific instances like C.M. and B.M.'s separation (paras 70-84, 96-97, etc.)\n- Government's failure to track families (paras 53-57)\n- The EO and reunification chaos (paras 59-68)\n\nBut the previous values were more general. For example, value 5 was \"Families separated for months with limited information...\" which is a general fact. The specific case of C.M. and B.M. is an example of that general fact, so it might not be a new distinct value. However, the checklist might require each unique factual detail to be listed. Wait, the checklist definition says: \"Details of the relevant events—For example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. Evidence – Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts.\"\n\nSo the specific events (like C.M. and B.M.'s separation) should be separate entries. The previous value 5 was a general statement about the separation duration and lack of communication. The specific case of C.M. and B.M. would be a distinct factual basis example. Wait, but the checklist item is \"Factual_Basis_of_Case,\" which refers to the facts upon which the case is built. The case is built on the general policy, but the specific instances (like C.M. and B.M.) are part of the evidence supporting that general policy. However, the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value,\" so each unique fact mentioned should be extracted.\n\nWait, but the previous append_checklist (Step 3) already included 5 values. The Step 4 read might have more. Let me check the text again. The text in Step 4 includes:\n\n- Paragraph 70-105: Details of C.M. and B.M.'s separation (specific event)\n- Paragraphs 53-57: Government's failure to track families (specific evidence)\n- Paragraphs 59-68: EO and reunification chaos (specific events)\n\nThe previous value 5 was \"Families separated for months with limited information...\" which covers the general fact. The specific case of C.M. and B.M. might be considered part of that general fact, but the checklist might require the specific instance as a separate value. However, the instructions say \"every distinct value,\" so if the document mentions \"C.M. and B.M. were separated for months with no communication,\" that's a specific instance, which would be a distinct value from the general statement.\n\nWait, but the previous value 5 already includes the general statement. The specific example (C.M. and B.M.) is an instance of that general fact, not a new distinct fact. So perhaps no new values are added here. However, the document might have other specific facts not covered in the previous 5.\n\nLooking at the text provided in Step 4, there's a mention of the government's failure to track families (para 56-57), which was not in the previous values. The previous values were:\n\n1. Policy of forcibly separating to cause trauma and deter\n2. Government acknowledged separating 3,800 children\n3. Trump's tweet about deterrence\n4. Dec 2017 memo's deterrent effect\n5. Families separated for months with limited info\n\nThe new text adds the government's failure to track families (para 56-57), which is a specific factual basis. So that's a new value. For example, \"The government failed to implement a tracking system to monitor separated families, leading to delays in reunification and increased trauma.\"\n\nAlso, the EO on June 20, 2018, and the subsequent chaotic reunification efforts (paras 59-68) might be another fact. But the EO itself is part of the policy implementation, so maybe covered under the general policy. However, the specific failure to have a reunification procedure (para 61) is new.\n\nWait, in Step 3's append, the values were:\n\n- Value 4: Dec 2017 memo's deterrent effect (from page 10)\n- Value 5: Families separated for months with limited info (page 5)\n\nNow, in Step 4, para 56-57 says the government had no tracking system, which is a specific factual basis. So that's a new value. Let's check the exact text:\n\nPara 56: \"When the DHS OIG pressed ICE for information... ICE could not provide the information, and had to request it from HHS. DHS later 'acknowledged to the OIG that there is no ‘direct electronic interface’ between the DHS and HHS tracking systems.'\"\n\nSo the factual basis here is the government's failure to have a tracking system, which caused delays. That's a distinct fact from the general separation policy. So this should be a new value.\n\nSimilarly, para 57 mentions Judge Sabraw's ruling about the government's failure to track families, which is part of the factual basis.\n\nSo, the new value would be: \"Government failed to create a tracking system for separated families, leading to inability to locate children and reunite them, as noted in DHS OIG report.\"\n\nTherefore, after reading the new text (tokens 10001-20001), there's a new factual basis value to append.\n\nSo the next action should be to append_checklist with this new value. But wait, the user's recent action (Step 4) was read_document on tokens 10001-20001, so after reading, the next step is to append the new value(s) found.\n\nThe current status shows that Factual_Basis_of_Case has 5 values. The new text adds at least one more (the tracking system failure). So I need to call append_checklist with the new value.\n\nLet me confirm if there are more. For example, para 93 mentions C.M. speaking to B.M. again, but that's part of the general fact of limited communication, which was already covered in value 5. The specific tracking failure is new.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the new value for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\"\n\nSo after reading the new tokens, I need to append any new values. The previous 5 are already in the checklist, so the new value from para 56-57 is the one to add.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is append_checklist with the new evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Government failed to implement a tracking system for separated families, resulting in inability to locate children and reunite them, as evidenced by DHS OIG report stating 'no direct electronic interface' between DHS and HHS tracking systems\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"ICE could not provide the information, and had to request it from HHS.

However, the user should check the remaining tokens in Complaint first before moving to other documents. Since the Complaint is the main document where the facts are laid out, it's efficient to finish reading it before checking others.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the next token range in Complaint, say 20001-30000 (within the 10k limit). That's the most efficient step. The user shouldn't jump to other documents yet because the Complaint might still have more evidence for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nWait, the current viewed tokens are 0-20001, so the next unvisited would start at 20001.

The task is to extract all checklist items for Factual_Basis_of_Case from the documents. The user has provided a snapshot of the current state.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've read the Complaint document in three parts (tokens 0-10000, 10001-20000, 20001-30000) and appended values each time. Now, the Complaint is partially visited with 70% coverage (tokens 0-30001). The next step would be to check if there's more to read in the Complaint or if other documents might have relevant info.\n\nWait, the available documents include 10 total. The Complaint is partially visited, but the other documents (Docket, Order, etc.) are unvisited. However, the checklist item is about the factual basis of the case, which is likely in the Complaint itself, since that's where the case details are. The previous steps already extracted 6 values from the Complaint. The user's instructions say to extract every distinct value from any document, but if the Complaint has covered all the facts, maybe no more is needed.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning Factual_Basis_of_Case has 6 values. The next action should be to check if there are more values in the remaining parts of the Complaint or other documents. But the Complaint is at 70% coverage (30k tokens out of 42k), so there's still 12k tokens left. However, the user's instructions say not to reread fully visited documents, but the Complaint is partially visited. So maybe read the next token range in Complaint.\n\nBut the previous steps read up to 30001 tokens. The Complaint has 42,744 tokens, so the next range would be 30001-40001 (10k tokens). However, the system says to read ≤10k tokens per call. So the next logical step is to read the next 10k tokens (30001-40001) of the Complaint. But wait, the last read was up to 30001, so next would be 30001-40001.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Viewed tokens: 0-30001 (70% coverage)\", so the next read should be from 30001 onwards.

So the next step would be to read 30001-40001.\n\nBut looking at the evidence, the previous append_checklist added a value about the DHS OIG report. The remaining part of the Complaint might have more details. The checklist requires all distinct values, so if there's more in the Complaint, we need to extract them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all relevant facts are already extracted. But the system's instructions say to continue until all values are found. Since the Complaint is partially read, it's better to read the remaining part to be thorough.\n\nWait, the available documents include other docket entries and orders. But the factual basis is typically in the complaint, so other documents might not have additional facts. The user's previous steps have already read the complaint in three chunks and appended values. The next step is to check if the complaint has more content.\n\nThe Complaint's token count is 42,744. The current viewed tokens are 0-30001, so remaining tokens are 30001-42744 (12,743 tokens). But the system requires reading ≤10k tokens per call, so next read should be 30001-40001 (10,000 tokens).\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on Complaint with start_token 30001, end_token 40001.\n\nWait, the previous read was 20001-30001 (Step 6), so the next should be 30001-40001. But the system says to avoid redundant reads, so yes, that's the next step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the remaining tokens don't have more facts.
