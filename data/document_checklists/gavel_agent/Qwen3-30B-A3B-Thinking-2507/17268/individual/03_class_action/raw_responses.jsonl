The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read.

The key is empty, so I need to find where this info might be. The complaint document usually states the type of action, so that's a good starting point. The complaint is 42k tokens, but the maximum read is 10k tokens. I should read the first part since the beginning might have the class action designation.\n\nWait, the decision policy says to use read_document for targeted windows. Since the complaint is the most likely place, I'll read the first 10k tokens. Need to make sure not to exceed the token limit. The complaint's token count is 42,744, so starting at 0 to 10,000 should be safe.\n\nCheck the available documents: Complaint is listed as unvisited. No other documents seem as relevant for the initial status. Dockets might have case info, but the complaint is the primary document where the plaintiff's claim is stated. So reading the Complaint first makes sense.\n\nNo regex needed here because the exact phrase might be in the complaint. Using read_document to get the start of the document.

The task is to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state, and the recent actions.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was read_document on Complaint (tokens 0-10000). Now, the current status shows that the Complaint document is partially visited (viewed 0-10000, 23% coverage), and the checklist item is still empty.\n\nThe checklist item requires extracting whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. The example format is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the provided Complaint document excerpt (pages 1-17), the complaint starts with \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; M.R., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, J.R.; O.A., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, L.A.; and V.C., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, G.A., Plaintiffs,...\" \n\nThis indicates that there are five plaintiffs, each representing themselves and their minor children. The complaint is filed by multiple plaintiffs, but it's not clear if this is a class action or individual plaintiffs. The key here is to determine if they're suing as a class action or as individuals.\n\nIn legal terms, a class action typically has a representative plaintiff(s) on behalf of a larger class. However, the complaint lists five specific plaintiffs (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C.), each with their own child. The complaint doesn't mention a class, but rather lists the plaintiffs individually. The description says \"on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child,\" which suggests they are suing for themselves and their children, but not as a class action. However, sometimes in class actions, the named plaintiffs are part of a larger group, but the complaint might still be filed as a class action.\n\nWait, the complaint says \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.\" etc. So each plaintiff is suing for themselves and their child. But the case might be a class action where these five are the named plaintiffs representing a larger class. However, the document doesn't explicitly state \"Class Action\" or \"Class Action Complaint.\" The user's checklist item requires the designation as either \"Class Action\" or \"Individual.\"\n\nLooking at the document, there's a mention of \"the government has acknowledged that it has separated at least 3,800 children from their parents or guardians\" in the complaint (page 4, line 2). But this is a factual statement, not indicating the nature of the lawsuit.\n\nWait, in the complaint, the title is \"COMPLAINT\" and it lists the plaintiffs as five individuals. The caption says \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; etc.\" So each plaintiff is suing for themselves and their child, but they are not a class. However, in some cases, even if there are multiple plaintiffs, if they are all part of a larger class, it's a class action. But the complaint doesn't say \"Class Action\" anywhere in the provided text.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"a designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs.\" So the key is to find if the document states that it's a class action or individual. The document here lists five plaintiffs, each with their own child, but doesn't explicitly say \"Class Action.\" However, the fact that they are suing on behalf of their children might imply that they are representing a class of similar plaintiffs. But the standard way to identify a class action is if the complaint is filed as a class action, which would have a class definition.\n\nLooking at the text, the complaint's caption lists the plaintiffs as specific individuals, not as a class. For example, \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.\" So it's not a class action; it's five individual plaintiffs (each with their child as a minor plaintiff). Wait, but the minor children are also plaintiffs. So the plaintiffs are the mothers and their children. But the complaint is filed by the mothers on behalf of themselves and their children. However, in legal terms, this could still be a class action if they are representing a larger group. But the document doesn't mention a class. The text says \"Plaintiffs\" followed by the list, so it's a multi-plaintiff case, but not necessarily a class action.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item requires \"Class Action\" or \"Individual.\" If the case is filed as a class action, it would say so. If it's individual plaintiffs (multiple individuals suing), then it's \"Individual.\"\n\nIn the provided text, the complaint is titled \"COMPLAINT\" and lists the plaintiffs as five individuals (the mothers) and their children as part of the plaintiffs. However, the way it's phrased—\"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.\"—suggests that each mother is suing for herself and her child. So the plaintiffs are the five mothers and their five children, making ten plaintiffs total. But this is still a multi-plaintiff case, not a class action. A class action would have a class definition, like \"on behalf of all similarly situated individuals.\"\n\nSince the document doesn't mention \"class action\" or \"class\" in the complaint, it's likely that this is a case with individual plaintiffs. However, the user's checklist item requires the value to be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description would need to explain the individuals.\n\nFrom the text, the plaintiffs are five mothers (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C.) and their respective children (B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A.). So the description would be \"five mothers and their minor children\" or something similar.\n\nWait, but the complaint says \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.\" So each plaintiff is a mother suing for herself and her child. So the plaintiffs are the mothers, and the children are part of the claims, but the named plaintiffs are the mothers. So the case is brought by the mothers as individual plaintiffs, each representing themselves and their child. Therefore, it's not a class action; it's individual plaintiffs with each plaintiff having a minor child as a co-plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children.\"\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be the verbatim text from the document. The relevant part is on page 1, lines 9-13:\n\n\"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; M.R., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, J.R.; O.A., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, L.A.; and V.C., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, G.A., Plaintiffs,\"\n\nSo the evidence text is that exact line. The source document is \"Complaint\", and the location is \"Page 1 of 77\" (from the document header).\n\nSince the checklist item is empty, and we've found the value in the Complaint, the next action should be to append this value to the checklist using append_checklist.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". The extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children.\" But the exact wording in the document is \"on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child\", so the description should be based on that.\n\nWait, the user's requirement says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nSo for this case, it's \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children.\"\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text. The verbatim text from the document is the list of plaintiffs as stated.\n\nSo the evidence entry should have:\n- text: \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; M.R., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, J.R.; O.A., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, L.A.; and V.C., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, G.A., Plaintiffs,\"\n- source_document: \"Complaint\"\n- location: \"Page 1 of 77\"\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value to the checklist using append_checklist.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was a read_document on Complaint (0-10000), and the text provided includes this part. So the assistant should now call append_checklist with the extracted value.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is the formatted string.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted entry with the evidence.\n\nThe extracted entry's value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children.\"\n\nWait, but the description should be based on the document. The document lists the five mothers and their children, so the description is \"five mothers and their minor children.\"\n\nYes. So the value is correctly formatted.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; M.R., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, J.R.; O.A., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, L.A.; and V.C., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, G.A., Plaintiffs,\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 77\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children", "evidence": [{"text": "C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; M.R., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, J.R.; O.A., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, L.A.; and V.C., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, G.A., Plaintiffs,", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 of 77"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14752, "completion_tokens": 2305, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item they need is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already processed the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000) and found one value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children\". That was appended in Step 3. The document is partially visited (23% covered), so there's more to read.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are other documents that might contain additional information. The available documents include other dockets, orders, and a settlement notice. The user needs to extract all distinct values, so maybe other documents have more details.\n\nWait, the current checklist item only has one value. But the requirement is to extract EVERY distinct value from any document. So I need to check if other documents might have different classifications. For example, maybe a later document mentions a class action certification or a settlement that changes the status.\n\nThe Complaint shows individual plaintiffs, but maybe in a subsequent order or motion, the case was certified as a class action. The document list has several Orders, like \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" which might mention class action status.\n\nSince the Complaint is partially read (only 0-10000 tokens), maybe the full document has more info. But the user already read up to page 17, and the text shows the plaintiffs are listed as individuals. However, the case might have been amended later.\n\nWait, the current extraction from the Complaint says \"five mothers and their minor children\" as individual plaintiffs. The checklist requires the value to be either \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\" with a description. So the current entry is correct for individual.\n\nBut I need to check other documents. The next logical step would be to read more of the Complaint to see if there's any mention of class action later, or to check other documents like the Dockets or Orders for any mention of class certification.\n\nThe user's recent action was appending the value from the Complaint. Now, the Complaint is partially visited (23% coverage), so maybe there's more in the Complaint. But the extracted value already describes the plaintiffs as individuals, so maybe the rest of the document doesn't change that. However, the user should verify if there's any other part of the Complaint that might indicate a class action.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other documents: the Docket (001) might have a notice of class certification. Or the \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement\" might mention if it's a class action.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited documents. The Complaint is partially visited, so reading more of it (unviewed tokens) could be useful. However, the current evidence is from the first page, which clearly states the plaintiffs as individuals. The next step should be to check if other documents have different information.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so if the case was originally filed as individual but later certified as a class, the value would need to be updated. But the current extraction is from the Complaint, which is the initial filing.\n\nThe user should check if other documents (like an order certifying the class) exist. The document list includes \"Order (003)\" which is 27,352 tokens. Maybe that order certifies a class action.\n\nBut the user needs to find evidence. Since the current state shows only one value, and the case might still be individual, but perhaps another document states it's a class action.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children\". The case might have been filed as individual plaintiffs, but maybe the plaintiffs later moved to certify a class. However, the user needs to extract all distinct values from any document. So if there's a document that says \"this is a class action\", that would be a separate value.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" might mention class action. Settlements often relate to class actions.\n\nThe safest next step is to search for patterns related to \"class action\" or \"class certification\" using `search_document_regex` across all documents. That way, the user can find if any document mentions class action status.\n\nThe regex pattern could be \"class action|class certification|class action certification\" with appropriate flags. Since the user needs to find evidence, using a regex search would efficiently locate relevant sections.\n\nAlternatively, since the Complaint was partially read, maybe continue reading the Complaint. But the current evidence is sufficient for the individual status, and the user should check other documents for possible class action mentions.\n\nGiven the tools available, `search_document_regex` is the best next action to find any mention of class action in the corpus. The pattern should be broad enough to catch variations but specific to the context.\n\nSo the next action should be to call `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"class action|class certification\" across all documents to see if there's any evidence of class action status in other documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"class action|class certification|class action certification\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "class action|class certification|class action certification", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14910, "completion_tokens": 1148, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The next step is to check if there's more info in the Complaint beyond the first 10k tokens. The document is marked as partially visited, so they should read the unviewed tokens. The next unviewed range would start from 10000. Since the maximum allowed per read is 10,000 tokens, they should read from 10000 to 20000.\n\nWait, but the Complaint has 42,744 tokens.

But the task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The user mentioned \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\"\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". The previous extraction from the Complaint shows that the plaintiffs are individual mothers suing on behalf of themselves and their children. The complaint lists them as \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, B.G.; etc.\" So they are individual plaintiffs, not a class action.

The recent actions include a search_document_regex for \"class action\" across all documents, which found 0 matches. The user also read the Complaint up to 20,000 tokens, but the previous extraction was from the first 10,000 tokens. The new read was from 10,000-20,000 tokens, but the content provided (pages 16-34) doesn't mention anything about class action certification or the case being a class action. The complaint itself is filed by individual plaintiffs, and the case is referenced as part of the Ms. L. class action, but the plaintiffs here are individuals.\n\nWait, the complaint mentions \"the class in Ms. L.\" in paragraph 62, but that's the class in the Ms. L. case, not this case. This case (2:19-cv-05217-SRB) is filed by the individual plaintiffs, not as a class action. The Ms. L. case is a separate class action, but this one is individual. So the current case is not a class action; it's individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe user's checklist item is for this specific case (2:19-cv-05217-SRB), so the answer should be individual plaintiffs.

The other documents (Docket entries, Orders) haven't been read yet. But the current document catalog shows that Complaint is partially visited (0-20000 tokens), and other documents are unvisited. However, the search for \"class action\" didn't find anything, so maybe there's no class action designation here.\n\nBut the task is to extract from the legal documents. The complaint itself is the main document. The previous extraction from the complaint's first page (page 1) correctly identified the plaintiffs as individuals. The rest of the complaint (pages 16-34) doesn't mention class action; it refers to the Ms. L. class case but this case is separate.\n\nSo, the only value to extract is the individual plaintiffs description. The checklist item should have one value. The current status shows 1 value extracted, so maybe it's done. But the user says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", and there's only one value here.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". The value is \"Individual\" because the plaintiffs are suing as individuals, not as a class. The complaint doesn't mention this being a class action; the plaintiffs are listed individually. The Ms. L. case is a class action, but this case (2:19-cv-05217) is not. So the extracted value is correct.\n\nThe next step would be to check if there are any other documents that might have a different value. But the search for \"class action\" in all documents found 0 matches. The other documents are unvisited, but since the regex search didn't find anything, it's unlikely they contain class action mentions. The Docket entries might have the case type, but the regex search would have caught it.\n\nWait, the search was done on all documents with pattern \"class action|class certification|class action certification\", and found 0 matches. So no other documents mention class action. Therefore, the only value is the individual plaintiffs description.\n\nThe current checklist has 1 value, and there are no empty keys. So the next action should be to stop, since all keys are filled.\n\nBut the system says \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is complete with one value.

{"step": 8, "run_id": "cb2ec077-d502-415e-8c0a-18ea99116784", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T09:38:15.673006-04:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let me go through the current situation step by step. The task is to extract the class action status from legal documents, specifically the checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions:\n\n- Step 1: list_documents found 10 documents.\n- Step 2: read_document on Complaint (tokens 0-10000)\n- Step 3: append_checklist added one value from Complaint: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five mothers and their minor children\"\n- Step 4: search_document_regex on all documents for \"class action\" patterns found 0 matches\n- Step 5: read_document on Complaint again (tokens 10000-20000) - this new text continues the Complaint but doesn't mention any class action references\n- Step 6: called stop, but the system says \"All checklist items are fully extracted with one value\" based on the evidence found\n- Step 7: get_checklist was automatically run, showing 1/1 filled\n\nNow, the current status shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1 (Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs has 1 value)\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Documents: Complaint is partially visited (0-20000 tokens, 47% coverage), others are unvisited\n\nThe problem is that the Complaint text from Step 5 (tokens 10000-20000) was read but didn't contain any new information about class action status. The previous evidence from Step 3 already established that the plaintiffs are individual mothers with minor children, and the regex search found no class action references.\n\nI need to verify if there's any other document that might contain class action references. The Complaint is partially visited (only 47% covered), but the regex search already found 0 matches across all documents. The other documents (Docket, Orders, etc.) haven't been read yet.\n\nHowever, the system's automatic checklist review (Step 7) says \"1/1 filled\" and \"All checklist items are fully extracted with one value.\" The evidence from the Complaint clearly states \"five mothers and their minor children\" as the plaintiffs, which matches the required format \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nThe regex search for \"class action\" patterns found zero matches, which is strong evidence that there's no class action designation in any document. The system's own assessment at Step 6 said \"no class action references were found in any documents via regex search.\"\n\nSince:\n1. The Complaint explicitly identifies plaintiffs as individuals\n2. The regex search found zero class action references across all documents\n3. The checklist item only requires extracting the value if present, and here it's clearly individual plaintiffs\n\nThere are no more values to extract. The checklist item is already fully extracted with one valid value. The \"Not Applicable\" case doesn't apply here because the item is applicable (it's about whether it's class or individual, and we have the individual designation).\n\nThe system's automatic review confirms 1/1 filled, so the next logical step is to stop. The system even says \"This is stop attempt 1/2 (system will accept second stop as final)\" - but since the state is already complete, we can stop now.\n\nI should call \"stop\" with the reason that all applicable checklist items are fully extracted with evidence, and no class action references were found in any documents.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with one value (individual plaintiffs) from Complaint. Regex search found no class action references across all documents. Checklist status shows 1/1 filled with complete evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are fully extracted with one value (individual plaintiffs) from Complaint.
