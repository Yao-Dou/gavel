The user needs to extract three specific checklist items from legal case documents. But looking at the current status, there are no documents in the corpus. The \"Documents in Corpus\" field says 0, and the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nHmm, the decision policy says that if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. Since there are no documents listed, the catalog isn't known yet. The next logical step is to list all available documents to see what's in the corpus. Without knowing the documents, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the catalog.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other options. The other actions like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require a document name, which isn't available yet. `get_checklist` would return empty since there's nothing to check. So yes, `list_documents` is the right first step. Let me confirm the tools: the `list_documents` function doesn't need any parameters, so the JSON should just be the function name with empty arguments.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3254, "completion_tokens": 257, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract three specific checklist items from legal documents. The current status shows all keys are empty, and there are seven unvisited documents. The first step was to list documents, which was done, so now I need to figure out which document to read next.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket seems like a good starting point because dockets usually list all the key dates and orders. The Docket document is 7,409 tokens, which is under the 10k limit, so I can read the whole thing. The checklist items include dates of decrees and durations, which are likely in the Docket entries.\n\nThe other documents like the Complaint or Motions might have some info, but the Docket is the most straightforward for dates and decree references. The Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) might mention terms, but the Docket would have the chronological order of entries, including when each decree was entered. So reading the Docket first makes sense.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Docket. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the entire document. Start at token 0, end at 7409. That should give me the necessary dates and maybe references to the decrees. Once I have that text, I can extract the dates for \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and check for duration terms in the Docket entries. The Significant Terms might be in the Order/Opinion documents, but I'll handle those after getting the dates from the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3493, "completion_tokens": 360, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract three specific checklist items from legal documents. The checklist items are Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nLooking at the current status, all three keys are empty. The Docket document has been fully read (tokens 0-7409), but the extracted values are still zero. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, and Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nThe Docket entry mentioned several orders, including the TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) granted on July 28, 2025, and subsequent amendments. The key here is that the TRO is a type of decree, so the Significant_Terms_of_Decrees should be in the orders. The Docket has the order granting the TRO, but it's just a brief entry. The actual terms might be in the Order/Opinion documents, which are unvisited.\n\nThe user's next step is to read a document that likely contains the decree terms. The Docket was already read, so the next logical step is to check the Order/Opinion documents. The most relevant ones would be the Temporary Restraining Order, Revised, and Second Revised versions. Since they're all unvisited, I should pick one to read.\n\nThe Temporary Restraining Order (Order/Opinion) is the first one mentioned, so maybe start with that. But the Docket shows that the order was amended multiple times, so the latest version (Second Revised) might have the most updated terms. However, the user needs to check each document. The document catalog lists them as separate, so reading the most recent one first could be efficient.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 34 says \"AMENDED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" on 8/7/25, and 37 is \"SECOND REVISED ORDER\" on 8/7/25. Then 47 is \"THIRD REVISED ORDER\" on 8/20/25. So the Third Revised Order is the latest. But the document names are \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised...\", \"Third Revised...\" but the document names listed are \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised...\", etc. So the Third Revised Order would be under \"Third Revised Order\" but it's not listed in the available documents. Wait, the available documents are:\n\n- Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion] - 1,909 tokens\n- Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion] - 1,996 tokens\n- Revised Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion] - 1,959 tokens\n\nWait, the Docket mentions \"Third REVISED ORDER\" as 47, but the document name might not have a \"Third\" version. The available documents have \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised\", and \"Revised\". Maybe the \"Revised\" is the first revision, \"Second Revised\" is the second, and the \"Third\" might not be a separate document. But the Docket says 47 is Third Revised, so perhaps the document named \"Second Revised\" is actually the third revision? Hmm, maybe not. The document names might not match the Docket's numbering exactly.\n\nBut regardless, the most recent order mentioned in the Docket is the Third Revised, so the document that corresponds to that would be the one to read. However, the available documents don't list a \"Third Revised\" document. The list shows \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised\", and \"Revised\". So perhaps the \"Revised\" is the first revision, \"Second Revised\" is the second, and the Third Revised might be the same as the Second Revised? Or maybe the Third Revised is part of the \"Second Revised\" document. This is a bit confusing, but the Docket entry 47 says \"THIRD REVISED ORDER\", so the actual document might be named \"Third Revised...\" but it's not listed. Wait, the available documents are:\n\n- **Revised Temporary Restraining Order** [Order/Opinion] - 1,959 tokens\n- **Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order** [Order/Opinion] - 1,996 tokens\n- **Temporary Restraining Order** [Order/Opinion] - 1,909 tokens\n\nSo the Third Revised might not be a separate document, or perhaps the \"Second Revised\" is the one that's actually the third revision. But the Docket has entries for 34 (Amended), 37 (Second Revised), 47 (Third Revised). So the Third Revised Order (47) would be a separate document. But it's not listed in the available documents. Wait, the user's available documents list shows those three, but maybe the Third Revised is part of the \"Second Revised\" document. Or perhaps the \"Second Revised\" is the one that was entered on 8/7/25, and the Third Revised is a later entry but not a separate document. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Temporary Restraining Order document (the first one) contains the original terms, and the revised ones have amendments. But the Significant Terms would be in the actual order, which is likely in one of these documents.\n\nSince the Docket mentions the order was granted on 7/28/25 (entry 23), and then amended, the original terms would be in the Temporary Restraining Order document. The Revised and Second Revised would have the updated terms. So the most relevant document to read first would be the Temporary Restraining Order (Order/Opinion) to get the initial terms.\n\nWait, but the Docket entry 23 is the order granting the TRO on 7/28/25. So the document named \"Temporary Restraining Order\" is likely the one from 7/28/25. The Revised and Second Revised would be the amended versions. So to get the significant terms, the original order is the best place to start. The user should read the \"Temporary Restraining Order\" document first.\n\nThe document is unvisited, so the next action should be to read it. The token count is 1,909 tokens, which is under 10k, so read_document is appropriate. The start_token should be 0, end_token 1909. But since it's unvisited, read the entire document.\n\nWait, the user needs to extract the Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. The Docket entry 23 says \"ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/2025.\" But the actual terms would be in the order document, not the Docket. The Docket is just a summary. So the order document is where the terms are specified.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to read the \"Temporary Restraining Order\" document to find the terms. So the action should be read_document on \"Temporary Restraining Order\" from 0 to 1909 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1909}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1909}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11097, "completion_tokens": 1567, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 4, "run_id": "32ca25b6-e435-4014-93e4-85b16a4202d6", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:48:48.915275-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The task is to extract three checklist items from the legal case documents. The user provided the snapshot with the current status, and I need to figure out the next action.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents. The Docket and Temporary Restraining Order have been fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), but the others are unvisited. The checklist items are Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. \n\nThe previous steps read the Docket (which didn't have any decrees) and the Temporary Restraining Order. The Temporary Restraining Order (Document 23) was read, and it's an order granting the TRO. The key part here is the \"The Court ORDERS as follows\" section. \n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, the order lists specific injunctions. For example, the court orders defendants to stop requiring certain conditions for grant funding. So, the terms are the prohibitions listed in points 1 and 2. Each of those points has subpoints (like i, ii, iii), so each of those should be separate entries. \n\nDates_of_All_Decrees: The order is dated July 28, 2025, as per the document. The order states it's effective until August 11, 2025. So the date of the decree is 2025-07-28, and the duration is until August 11. But the checklist for Dates_of_All_Decrees requires the date and the decree. The extracted value should be formatted as '[date]: [decree]'. The decree here is the Temporary Restraining Order, so \"2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nHow_Long_Decrees_will_Last: The order specifies it remains in effect until 5:00 pm EST on Monday, August 11, 2025. So the duration is from July 28 to August 11, which is 14 days. But the checklist says to format as '[duration]: [decree]'. The duration here would be \"until August 11, 2025\" or \"14 days\". The example given in the checklist uses the date, so probably \"2025-07-28 to 2025-08-11\" but the instruction says \"duration terms\", so maybe \"until August 11, 2025\". But the exact phrasing from the document is \"until 5:00 pm EST on Monday, August 11, 2025\". So the duration term is \"until August 11, 2025\".\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"the duration terms of any decrees (e.g., length of an injunction or consent decree)\". So the duration is \"until August 11, 2025\", but the format should be '[duration]: [decree]'. So the duration part is \"until August 11, 2025\" and the decree is the Temporary Restraining Order. So the extracted value would be \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nBut let me check the document again. The order says: \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect until 5:00 pm EST on Monday, August 11, 2025, pending further motions by the Parties or subsequent orders from this Court.\"\n\nSo for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the duration is \"until August 11, 2025\" (or the exact date mentioned). The decree here is the Temporary Restraining Order, so the value should be \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nNow, the Significant_Terms_of_Decrees needs all the substantive obligations. The court orders defendants to not require certain conditions (point 1a, 1b, etc.). Each of those is a specific term. For example:\n\n- Defendant HUD, Turner, etc., are enjoined from requiring HUD TRO Plaintiffs to agree to conditions like \"not use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology'...\" (subpoint i).\n\nSimilarly, for HHS, Kennedy, etc., from requiring the HHS ACF TRO Plaintiffs to certify they don't operate programs advancing DEI, etc.\n\nSo each of these subpoints should be separate entries. The checklist says \"every distinct value\", so each subpoint (i, ii, iii, iv for 1a; i for 2a) would be a separate value under Significant_Terms_of_Decrees.\n\nBut the evidence needs to include the exact text. So for each term, the evidence would be the verbatim text from the order.\n\nSo, for example, one entry would be:\n\nvalue: \"Defendant HUD, Defendant Scott Turner, and any person in active concert or participation with those parties, are enjoined from requiring Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, House of Hope Community Development Corporation, Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, or Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance’s members to agree to the condition that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\"\n\nBut wait, the checklist says \"substantive obligations imposed by any decree—what defendants are ordered to do or refrain from doing.\" So the obligation is the \"enjoined from\" part, so the value should be the specific condition they must not enforce. So the value would be \"Not requiring the recipient to agree to the condition that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168...\" but perhaps more concisely, as per the document.\n\nBut the exact text from the order is: \"requiring Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence... to agree to the following conditions or substantially similar conditions as a requirement for receiving funding under a Continuums of Care grant; and otherwise enforcing these or substantially similar conditions against those organizations with respect to a Continuums of Care grant: i. The requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168...\"\n\nSo the specific term is \"not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168'\". So the value would be \"Not using grant funds to promote 'gender ideology' as defined in E.O. 14168\" or something similar. But the checklist says to extract the exact terms, so the verbatim text from the order.\n\nWait, the user's requirement says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So the value should be the exact language from the decree. So for the first term, the value is \"the requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\".\n\nBut to keep it concise as per the example, maybe just the condition part. But the instruction says \"verbatim snippet\" for evidence, so the value can be the specific phrase.\n\nSo for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, the values are:\n\n- \"not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\"\n- \"the requirement that the recipient 'agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code'\"\n- \"the requirement that the recipient 'not use any Grant Funds to fund or promote elective abortions, as required by E.O. 14182, Enforcing the Hyde Amendment'\"\n- \"the condition that 'the Recipient’s use of funds provided under this Agreement … , and the Recipient’s operation of projects assisted with Grant Funds are governed by … [a]ll current Executive Orders.'\"\n- For HHS: \"the requirement that recipients must 'certify[]' that '[T]hey do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.'\"\n\nEach of these is a distinct term, so each should be a separate entry in the extracted list.\n\nNow, for Dates_of_All_Decrees, the date is 2025-07-28, and the decree is the Temporary Restraining Order. So the value should be \"2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the duration is \"until August 11, 2025\" (since the order states it remains in effect until that date), so the value is \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nBut the checklist says \"formatted as '[duration]: [decree]'\", so the duration term is \"until August 11, 2025\" and the decree is the name, so \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nNow, since the Temporary Restraining Order document has been fully read (tokens 0-1909), and the evidence is in that document, the next step is to append these values to the checklist. The user has done the read_document on that order, so the next action should be append_checklist with the extracted values.\n\nWait, but the current status says Keys with Values: 0/3, so all are empty. So after reading the order, we need to append the values.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with the three keys. But for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, there are multiple values (5 entries), so each value needs its own evidence entry.\n\nEach evidence entry must include the text, source_document, and location. The source_document is \"Temporary Restraining Order\", location is the page numbers (e.g., Page 2-5 as per the document).\n\nFor example, for the first term:\n\nvalue: \"not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\"\nevidence: {text: \"the requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\", source_document: \"Temporary Restraining Order\", location: \"Page 2\"}\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut the document shows the order is on pages 1-5, so the specific locations would be the page numbers where each part appears. For example, the first part (i) is on Page 2, ii on Page 2, etc.\n\nWait, the document shows:\n\nPage 2: \"i. The requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government';\"\n\nSo the exact text is on Page 2.\n\nSimilarly, ii is on Page 2, iii on Page 2, iv on Page 2 (for the HUD part), and for the HHS part, i is on Page 3.\n\nSo each of these can have their evidence with the page location.\n\nFor Dates_of_All_Decrees: the date is on Page 1, \"Filed 07/28/25\", and the decree is the Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: the duration is on Page 5, \"until 5:00 pm EST on Monday, August 11, 2025\".\n\nSo the next action is to append all these values using append_checklist.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that after reading a document, the next action must be append_checklist or update_checklist. Since we have multiple values to add, append_checklist is the right choice.\n\nSo the function call should be append_checklist with the patch containing the three keys, each with their extracted values.\n\nWait, but the checklist items are three: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, multiple values (5 entries), each with their own evidence.\n\nFor Dates_of_All_Decrees, one value: \"2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order\"\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, one value: \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\"\n\nWait, the format for Dates_of_All_Decrees is '[date]: [decree]'. The decree here is \"Temporary Restraining Order\", so \"2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nSimilarly, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last is '[duration]: [decree]', so \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nSo the append_checklist will have three keys, each with their respective extracted values.\n\nNow, to structure the patch for append_checklist. Each key in the patch has a \"key\" and \"extracted\" array of entries.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, extracted has 5 entries, each with their evidence.\n\nFor Dates_of_All_Decrees, extracted has 1 entry.\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, extracted has 1 entry.\n\nEach evidence entry must have \"text\", \"source_document\", \"location\".\n\nSo, for example, for the first term under Significant_Terms_of_Decrees:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"the requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"the requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Temporary Restraining Order\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 2\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ... (other four terms)\n  ]\n}\n\nSimilarly for the other keys.\n\nBut the user's example shows that for multiple values under one key, you can have multiple entries in the extracted array.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch should include all three keys with their respective entries.\n\nNow, checking if any of the keys have existing values. The current status says all are empty, so appending is correct.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call append_checklist with the three keys and their extracted values based on the Temporary Restraining Order document.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\":

{"step": 5, "run_id": "32ca25b6-e435-4014-93e4-85b16a4202d6", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:49:10.412740-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a legal document extraction specialist tasked with pulling specific checklist items from case documents. The current snapshot shows they've already done steps 1-4, which included listing documents, reading the Docket and Temporary Restraining Order, and appending the checklist items based on that.\n\nLooking at the current status: They've extracted all 3 checklist items from the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) document. The Significant_Terms_of_Decrees has 5 values, Dates_of_All_Decrees has 1, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has 1. All keys are filled with evidence. The documents they've read are fully visited (Docket and TRO), but there are 5 other documents unvisited.\n\nWait, but the checklist items are about decrees. The TRO is a decree, but the user mentioned \"decrees\" plural. The current extraction only has the TRO. The documents listed as unvisited include \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", and others. These might contain additional decrees or amendments.\n\nThe checklist says \"all decrees\", so they need to check if there are more decrees beyond the initial TRO. The current extraction only has the July 28 TRO, but the document catalog shows later orders like the \"Third Revised Order\" dated August 20. That might be another decree with different terms or duration.\n\nThe user's last action was appending the checklist values from the TRO. Now they need to check if other documents contain additional decrees. The available documents include \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" (1,959 tokens), \"Second Revised\" (1,996 tokens), and \"Third Revised Order\" (which they might have already seen in the Docket entries, but the document itself isn't read yet).\n\nWait, in the Docket (which is fully visited), they have entry 34: \"AMENDED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" on 8/7/25, and 37: \"SECOND REVISED ORDER\" on 8/7/25, and 47: \"THIRD REVISED ORDER\" on 8/20/25. These are all decrees that might have different terms or durations. The initial TRO was until August 11, but the revised orders might extend or modify it.\n\nSo the next step should be to read the revised orders to check if they contain new decree terms or dates. The \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" document (1,959 tokens) is unvisited and likely contains the first revision. Similarly, \"Second Revised\" and \"Third Revised\" might have more.\n\nBut the user needs to read one document at a time. The most recent one is the Third Revised Order (8/20/25), but the document names are \"Revised\", \"Second Revised\", \"Third Revised\". The Docket lists them as separate documents. The unvisited documents are:\n\n- Revised Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion] - 1,959 tokens\n- Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order - 1,996 tokens\n- Third Revised Order (but the document name might be listed as \"Third Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" or similar, but in the available documents it's listed as \"Third Revised Order\" in the Docket entry 47)\n\nWait, the available documents list \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", and \"Third Revised Order\" is probably the same as the document they need to read. But the exact names matter. The user should read the Revised ones to see if they have new terms.\n\nBut the checklist items are about \"decrees\", and the TRO is a decree. Each revision might be a new decree or an amendment to the existing one. The Significant_Terms_of_Decrees might be the same, but the duration could change. For example, the initial TRO was until August 11, but the revised orders might extend it.\n\nSo the user needs to read the Revised Temporary Restraining Order document to check if it has new terms or a new duration. The \"Revised\" document is the first revision (8/7/25), which the Docket entry 34 mentions. The \"Second Revised\" (8/7/25) is entry 37, and \"Third Revised\" (8/20/25) is entry 47.\n\nSince the user needs to check all decrees, they should read the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (document name as listed) to see if it has additional terms or a new date. The document is unvisited, so they should call read_document on it.\n\nThe current state shows that all keys have values, but maybe the revised orders have different duration or terms. For example, the initial TRO duration was until Aug 11, but the revised might extend it. So the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" might have another entry.\n\nAlso, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" might have the same terms but in a revised order, so it's not new, but the duration might be different. But the checklist says \"all decrees\", so each decree's duration should be listed. The initial TRO's duration is until Aug 11, but the revised orders might have new durations.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 47 says \"THIRD REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" dated 8/20/25. The order itself might have a new duration. So the user needs to read that document to check.\n\nBut the user should read one document at a time. The available documents include \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" (which is likely the first revision, 8/7/25), so reading that would be the next step. The \"Revised\" document is the first revision, then \"Second Revised\" is the next, etc.\n\nThe user's next action should be to read the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" document. The document name is \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion]\" with 1,959 tokens. Since it's unvisited, they should call read_document on it, tokens 0-1959.\n\nWait, but the document catalog says \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is unvisited, so the next logical step is to read that document to check for any additional decree terms or dates. The current extraction only has the initial TRO, but the revised versions might have new information.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" for the full token range (0-1959).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1959}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1959}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13995, "completion_tokens": 1463, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 6, "run_id": "32ca25b6-e435-4014-93e4-85b16a4202d6", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:49:32.055901-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The user needs me to extract specific checklist items from legal documents, and I'm at step 6 of the process. The current status shows all 3 checklist items have values already extracted, but I need to verify if there are more values to add.\n\nFirst, checking the available documents. The Docket and the two Temporary Restraining Orders (Temporary and Revised) are fully visited. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Second Revised Order, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, and Motion for TRO. \n\nLooking at the checklist items:\n- Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: Already has 5 values from the Temporary Restraining Order. But the Revised Order might have additional terms. Let me check the Revised Order text. Wait, in the Revised Order (Step 5), the terms are similar but the list of plaintiffs changed. However, the actual terms (like the DEI requirements) are the same as the original. So no new terms are added here. The terms are identical to the first order, just updated plaintiff names. So no new terms to extract.\n\n- Dates_of_All_Decrees: Currently has \"2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order\" from the first order. The Revised Order is dated 2025-08-07. So there's a new decree date to add. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Document 34) was filed on 08/07/25, so that's a new decree date. Need to add that.\n\n- How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: Currently has \"until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order\". The Revised Order states it remains \"pending further order... until the hearing on September 4, 2025\". So the duration changed. The original TRO lasted until Aug 11, but the Revised TRO lasts until the hearing on Sept 4. So need to add the new duration.\n\nWait, the Revised Order's duration says \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect pending further order from this Court... A hearing for the pending motion has been scheduled for September 4, 2025.\" So the new duration is \"until September 4, 2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nSo for Dates_of_All_Decrees, need to add the August 7, 2025 date. For How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, need to add the new duration.\n\nBut the user has to use the exact format: Dates should be [date]: [decree], and How_Long should be [duration]: [decree].\n\nSo for Dates:\n- 2025-07-28: Temporary Restraining Order (already there)\n- 2025-08-07: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\n\nFor How_Long:\n- until August 11, 2025: Temporary Restraining Order (existing)\n- pending further order until September 4, 2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\n\nWait, the Revised Order's duration isn't a fixed end date but \"pending further order until September 4\". So the extracted value should be formatted as \"until September 4, 2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nNow, the next step is to use append_checklist to add these two new values (one for Dates, one for How_Long). The Significant_Terms are already covered since the terms didn't change.\n\nCheck the documents: The Revised Temporary Restraining Order is fully visited (100% coverage), so no need to read it again. But since the values are already in the document, and the document is fully visited, the evidence is available.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the new values for Dates_of_All_Decrees and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nWait, the user has already read the Revised Order in Step 5. The evidence for the new dates and duration is in that document. So the next step is to append the new entries.\n\nCheck the current checklist status: Dates has 1 value, How_Long has 1. Need to add the new ones.\n\nSo for Dates_of_All_Decrees, add \"2025-08-07: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, add \"until September 4, 2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nEach needs evidence from the Revised Order document.\n\nThe Revised Order's date is in the header: \"Filed 08/07/25\", and the duration is in the last paragraph: \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect pending further order from this Court... A hearing for the pending motion has been scheduled for September 4, 2025.\"\n\nSo evidence for Dates: from Revised Order (Page 1), \"Filed 08/07/25\".\n\nEvidence for How_Long: from Revised Order (Page 5), \"pending further order from this Court... until September 4, 2025\".\n\nSo the append_checklist should include these two new entries.\n\nNo other documents need to be read because the other unvisited documents (Complaint, etc.) are not relevant to these checklist items. The checklist items are about decrees, so the orders are the relevant documents. The Revised Order is already read and fully visited, so the values are extractable.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append the new values using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"2025-08-07: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Filed 08/07/25\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"until September 4, 2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect pending further order from this Court in order to accommodate the Parties' agreed upon briefing schedule for the pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 30).

{"step": 7, "run_id": "32ca25b6-e435-4014-93e4-85b16a4202d6", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:49:57.873807-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is working on extracting checklist items from legal documents, specifically for a case. The current status shows all three checklist items have values extracted: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees (5 values), Dates_of_All_Decrees (2 values), and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last (2 values). The documents that have been read are fully visited (Docket, Temporary Restraining Order, Revised Temporary Restraining Order), and the other documents are unvisited.\n\nWait, the checklist items are all filled, right? The user needs to confirm if there are any more values to extract. But looking at the available documents, the other ones are unvisited. However, the checklist items might not have more entries. Let me check the checklist definitions again.\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations from any decree. The Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Revised TRO have the terms. The Revised TRO seems to have similar terms but doesn't add new obligations. The other documents like Complaint, Second Revised TRO, etc., might not have additional decrees. The Complaint is a complaint, not a decree. The Motion for TRO is a motion, not the decree itself. The Second Revised TRO might have more terms, but the user hasn't read it yet.\n\nWait, the user has already read the Temporary Restraining Order and the Revised Temporary Restraining Order. The Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order is another document. The current extracted values for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last have two entries: one until Aug 11, 2025, and another until Sept 4, 2025. The Revised TRO (Document 34) says \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect pending further order from this Court... A hearing for the pending motion has been scheduled for September 4, 2025.\" So the duration is until the hearing date. The next decree might be the Second Revised TRO, which could have a different duration.\n\nBut the user hasn't read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order yet. The document is listed as unvisited. The current How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two values: one from the first TRO (until Aug 11) and one from the Revised TRO (until Sept 4). If the Second Revised TRO has a new duration, that would be another entry. However, the user needs to check if there's a new decree.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" need all decrees. The current values are 2025-07-28 and 2025-08-07. The Second Revised TRO (Document 37) might be a new decree. The user hasn't read that document yet. The document catalog shows \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is unvisited. So maybe there's another decree there that needs to be checked.\n\nBut the user's last action was appending the Revised TRO's date and duration. The next step would be to check if the Second Revised TRO has more entries. However, looking at the document names, the Revised TRO (Document 34) was filed on 08/07/25, and the Second Revised (Document 37) is filed on 08/07/25 as well. Wait, in the Docket, Document 37 is \"SECOND REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order.\" So that's another version of the TRO. The duration in Document 37 might be different. But the user hasn't read it yet.\n\nWait, the current extracted How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two entries: one until Aug 11 and one until Sept 4. The Second Revised Order might extend it further. However, the user needs to read the document to confirm. But the user's current step is to decide the next action. The available documents include the Second Revised TRO (unvisited). So the next logical step would be to read that document to check if there are more decree details.\n\nBut wait, the user's checklist items are all filled, but maybe there's a third decree. Let's check the Docket entries. Document 37 is the Second Revised Order. Document 47 is the Third Revised Order. The user has read up to Document 34 (Revised TRO), but not 37 or 47. However, the current extracted values for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last have two entries. If the Second Revised Order (Document 37) has a different duration, that's another entry. But the user hasn't read Document 37 yet.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions: they read the Temporary Restraining Order (Document 23), then the Revised (Document 34), and appended those. The next document to read would be Document 37 (Second Revised), which is listed as unvisited. But the user needs to check if there's a new decree. However, the checklist requires all decrees. If the Second Revised Order is another decree, then the duration might be different. For example, Document 37 says \"This Temporary Restraining Order shall remain in effect until 5:00 pm EST on Monday, August 11, 2025\" (from the first TRO), but the Revised TRO (Document 34) changed it to \"pending further order... hearing on Sept 4\". The Second Revised (Document 37) might have another change. Wait, the Docket shows Document 37 as \"SECOND REVISED ORDER\" filed on 08/07/25. The text in the Docket says \"SECOND REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order (amending ECF No. 34 Amended/Revised Order granting ECF No. 13 Motion for TRO).\" So it's amending the Revised TRO. The duration might have changed again.\n\nBut the user hasn't read Document 37 yet. So to be thorough, they should read it to check for any new decree terms or duration. However, the user's current status says all keys have values. But maybe the duration in Document 37 is different. Wait, the current How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two entries: one from Document 23 (until Aug 11) and one from Document 34 (until Sept 4). If Document 37 is another amendment, it might have a new duration. But the Docket entry for Document 37 says it's amending Document 34, so the duration might be the same as Document 34, or it might have a new one. Without reading it, the user can't be sure.\n\nBut the user needs to extract all applicable items. Since Document 37 is unvisited, they should read it to check. However, the user's instruction says \"never reread fully visited documents\" but this one is unvisited. So the next step should be to read Document 37 (Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order) to see if there's any new decree information.\n\nWait, the user's current checklist has How_Long_Decrees_will_Last with two values. If Document 37 doesn't add a new duration (maybe it's the same as Document 34), then no new value. But to confirm, they need to read it. However, the user's process says to analyze the text after reading. So the correct action is to read Document 37 (Second Revised Order) to check for any new decree terms or durations.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is unvisited. So the next action should be `read_document` on that document. The tokens are up to 1996, which is under 10k, so it's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use `search_document_regex` to look for \"until\" or \"duration\" in the document, but since it's a specific document, reading it directly is better. The user should read the entire document (since it's unvisited) to check for the required info.\n\nSo the next action is to call `read_document` on \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" from tokens 0-1996.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1996}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1996}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16371, "completion_tokens": 1805, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract checklist items from legal documents. The current state shows that all three checklist items have values, but there are still unvisited documents: Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for TRO.\n\nWait, the checklist items are Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. The existing extracted values come from the Temporary Restraining Order and Revised versions. But the problem is, the user might have more documents that could have additional decrees or dates. However, the current documents visited (Docket, Temporary, Revised, Second Revised) are all TROs, which are temporary. The other documents like Complaint and Motions might not contain the final decrees, but maybe the Motion for Preliminary Injunction could have a decree date or duration.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", but the documents so far are all Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), not final decrees. The TROs have their own dates and durations, but maybe there's a final decree later. However, the current documents listed don't include a final decree. The Complaint and Motions are preliminary filings. The Revised TROs mention the hearing date for the Preliminary Injunction on September 4, 2025, but that's a hearing date, not the decree date.\n\nWait, the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" for the Revised TRO is \"until September 4, 2025\" (the hearing date), but the actual decree duration might be until the final order. However, the user's checklist might consider TROs as decrees for the purpose of this extraction. The problem is that the existing extracted values are from TROs, and the checklist items don't specify final decrees only. So maybe the TROs are considered decrees here.\n\nBut the user has unvisited documents: Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for TRO. Let's check if those could have more values. The Complaint is the initial filing, which probably doesn't contain decrees. The Motions for TRO and Preliminary Injunction are requests, not decrees. The decrees are the court orders (TROs), which have already been read. So maybe all relevant documents have been read.\n\nWait, the Docket is fully visited. The TRO documents (Temporary, Revised, Second Revised) are all fully visited. The other three documents are unvisited, but they are complaints and motions, which are not decrees. So they probably don't contain any additional values for the checklist. The checklist items are about decrees, so the orders (TROs) are the relevant documents. The other documents are pleadings, not decrees.\n\nThe user's current status shows all keys have values, and there are no empty keys. The remaining documents are unvisited, but they're not likely to have more decree-related info. So maybe the extraction is complete. But let's check the checklist definitions again.\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations imposed by any decree. The TROs have the terms, so the 5 values from Temporary TRO are covered. The Revised and Second Revised have similar terms, but they're the same obligations. So no new terms, just the same ones. So no new values for Significant_Terms.\n\nDates_of_All_Decrees: The dates of decrees. The Temporary TRO is 07/28/25, Revised is 08/07/25, and Second Revised is also 08/07/25. Wait, the Second Revised is filed on 08/07/25, same as Revised. So the dates are 07/28/25 and 08/07/25. But the Second Revised might be a correction of the Revised, so maybe it's the same decree with a different date? Wait, the Revised TRO is Document 34, Filed 08/07/25, and Second Revised is Document 37, also Filed 08/07/25. So the date is the same. So the Dates_of_All_Decrees has two entries: 07/28/25 and 08/07/25. The Second Revised doesn't add a new date, so no new value.\n\nHow_Long_Decrees_will_Last: Temporary TRO ends 08/11/25, Revised TRO ends 09/04/25. The Second Revised also says \"pending further order... hearing on 09/04/25\", so same as Revised. So no new duration.\n\nTherefore, the existing extracted values cover all decrees. The unvisited documents (Complaint, Motions) are not decrees, so they won't add anything. So all checklist items are complete. The next step is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 3/3\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/3\", so all are filled. The Not Applicable is 0, meaning none are marked as Not Applicable. So the extraction is complete. The next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items have complete extracted values with evidence from fully visited TRO documents.

The user is asking me to extract specific checklist items from legal documents. The task is to get all the required values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already processed several documents. The Docket, Temporary Restraining Order, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, and Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order are all fully visited. The other documents—Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for TRO—are unvisited. But the user's note says those unvisited documents are non-decree pleadings, so they probably don't contain the decree terms, dates, or durations. The checklist status shows all three keys are filled with values: Significant_Terms has 5, Dates has 2, How_Long has 2.\n\nWait, the user's step 8 said they called `stop` but the system automatically ran `get_checklist` and now it's asking for a second stop. The current checklist status is 3/3 filled, 0 empty. The extraction progress shows all keys have values. The available documents that are unvisited are complaints and motions, which are not orders or decrees, so they shouldn't have the required info. The system's note says those are non-decree pleadings, so no need to read them.\n\nThe stop criteria require that all keys are either complete or marked Not Applicable. Since all are complete with evidence, the next step should be to stop. The user's step 9 shows that the checklist is 3/3 filled. The system's current status confirms that. So the correct action here is to call `stop` again, since it's the second attempt. The system mentioned \"stop attempt 1/2\" and now it's time for the second attempt to stop.\n\nI need to make sure there's no missing values. The previous steps (steps 5-7) added the remaining values from the Revised and Second Revised Orders. The checklist summary shows all keys are filled. There's no indication of missing data. The unvisited documents are irrelevant for decree terms, so no need to read them.
