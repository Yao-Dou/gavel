The available actions include `list_documents`, which is the first step when the catalog is unknown. Since the system hasn't found any documents yet, the correct action here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the decision policy: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" The current state shows \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the next step must be to list the documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents exist.

The user needs me to extract five specific items from legal documents, and right now all keys are empty. The task is to systematically go through the documents to find the required information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each checklist item requires. The items are:\n\n1. **Significant_Terms_of_Settlement**: Substantive obligations in the settlement.\n2. **Date_of_Settlement**: Calendar date of settlement, formatted as \"[date]: [settlement]\".\n3. **How_Long_Settlement_will_Last**: Duration terms, formatted as \"[duration]: [settlement]\".\n4. **Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not**: Yes/No answer.\n5. **Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement**: Information about disputes or enforcement issues.\n\nAll documents are currently unvisited, so I need to start by reading one. The documents include a Complaint, Docket, several Orders, and Motions. The Docket might have dates and settlement info, but the Motions and Orders could also contain relevant details. Since the checklist items relate to settlement terms, dates, and enforcement, the most likely places to find this info would be in the Docket (which lists case events), the Motions (if they mention settlement), and the Orders (if there's a court-approved settlement).\n\nThe user mentioned that the Docket is a document with 7,409 tokens. It's a good candidate because dockets often list settlement dates, court orders, and any related motions. The Docket might have entries like \"Settlement approved on [date]\" or \"Consent decree entered.\" So, reading the Docket first makes sense.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Docket. The Docket is unvisited, so I'll read the entire document since it's under 10k tokens (7,409). Starting from token 0 to the end. That way, I can get all the information in one go without needing multiple reads. The other documents might not have the settlement details, so focusing on the Docket first is efficient.\n\nWait, but maybe the Complaint or Motions mention settlement terms. However, the Docket is more likely to have the official dates and court actions. For example, a docket entry might say \"Settlement Agreement filed on 2023-05-15\" or \"Court approves settlement.\" So, the Docket is the best first step.\n\nI'll call `read_document` for the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 7409 (the full document). That should give me the necessary context to extract the checklist items. After reading, I'll analyze the text to find any mentions of settlement dates, terms, enforcement, etc., and then use `append_checklist` to add the extracted values with evidence.\n\nNo need for regex search here because the Docket is a structured document where settlement info would be listed in entries. Reading the whole document is straightforward. So, the next action is to read the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3603, "completion_tokens": 681, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract five specific checklist items from legal documents. So far, they've read the Docket document, which is fully visited, but none of the checklist items have values. The Docket has entries about motions, orders, hearings, but no settlement terms, dates, duration, enforcement, or disputes.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is already fully read. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, various Orders, Motions. The checklist items are about settlement terms, which probably aren't in the Docket. The Docket mentions a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and some motions to amend it, but no settlement. Settlements usually come later in a case, maybe in a consent decree or final judgment. The current documents don't show a settlement yet. \n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The most relevant ones would be the Orders (like the Revised TROs) or the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. But the user needs to find where settlement terms might be mentioned. Since the case is still in the preliminary injunction phase, maybe there's no settlement yet. But the checklist items are for if there is a settlement. If the documents don't mention a settlement, then the items would be Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract all applicable items. If there's no settlement, then the checklist items should be marked Not Applicable. But they need to confirm that. The Docket has orders granting TROs, but no settlement. The next logical step is to check the other documents to see if any mention a settlement. The most likely place would be in the Orders or the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. However, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (document 30) is about seeking relief, not settling. The Orders are about TROs, which are temporary, not settlements.\n\nSo maybe the case hasn't settled yet, so all checklist items should be Not Applicable. But the user needs to confirm by checking the other documents. The next action should be to read one of the Order documents to see if they contain settlement terms. The Revised Temporary Restraining Orders might have more details. Let's check the document names: \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" and others. These are TROs, not settlements. Settlements are usually in consent decrees or final judgments. Since the case is still ongoing (with a hearing scheduled for 9/4/2025), there's probably no settlement yet. \n\nBut the user must verify by checking the documents. The next step is to read one of the Order documents. Let's pick the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] since it's a document that might have more details. It's unvisited, so read it. But the user can only read up to 10,000 tokens. The token count is 1,959, so that's safe. So the next action is read_document on \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" from tokens 0-1959.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1959}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1959}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11207, "completion_tokens": 683, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 4, "run_id": "373f4b58-8c95-4227-a40a-45e76929000a", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:49:59.358631-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to extract specific checklist items from legal case documents. The checklist has five items: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, Date_of_Settlement, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not, and Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's been done so far. The recent actions show that they've read the Docket and the Revised Temporary Restraining Order. The Docket has entries up to August 25th, 2025, and the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Document 34) is from August 7, 2025. The order details the terms of the TRO, which might relate to the checklist items.\n\nLooking at the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, it's a court order granting a TRO. The key parts here are the injunctions against HUD and HHS regarding funding conditions. For example, the order says Defendants are enjoined from requiring certain conditions related to DEI, gender ideology, etc. That seems to be the \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" because it's the substantive obligations agreed upon (in this case, ordered by the court).\n\nThe Date_of_Settlement: The TRO was issued on August 7, 2025. The order states \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" So the date is 2025-08-07.\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: The order says it remains in effect \"pending further order from this Court\" and mentions a hearing on September 4, 2025. So the duration isn't specified as a fixed period but until the preliminary injunction hearing. The format requires \"[duration]: [settlement]\". Since it's pending further order, maybe \"Pending Preliminary Injunction Hearing (September 4, 2025): TRO remains in effect until further court order.\"\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced: The TRO is a court order, so it's court-enforced. The answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nDisputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: The order mentions that the Plaintiffs moved for relief regarding the HHS Grants Policy Statement, and the Court deferred ruling. Also, there's a Motion to Amend the TRO (ECF No. 28, 31, 35, 42) which were filed, and the Court granted some amendments. So there were disputes about the terms of the TRO, which are part of enforcement. The evidence would be the motions to amend and the court's responses.\n\nNow, checking the documents. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Document 34) has the key info. The Docket entries show motions related to the TRO, like the Motion to Amend (ECF 28, 31, etc.), which indicate disputes. But the main terms are in the order itself.\n\nSo, for Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, the evidence is the injunctions in the order. For Date_of_Settlement, the date on the order. How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is the duration mentioned (pending hearing). Whether Court-enforced is yes. Disputes are the motions to amend.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Settlement\", but this is a Temporary Restraining Order, not a settlement. A settlement would be an agreement between parties, but here it's a court order. The user's checklist might be misusing \"settlement\" here. But according to the task, the checklist items are as defined, so I have to go with what's given. The problem is, the case hasn't settled; it's a TRO pending a preliminary injunction. So maybe \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" isn't applicable? But the order does have terms that the parties must follow, so perhaps it's being treated as the settlement terms for the purpose of this checklist.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" as the substantive obligations in any settlement. But this is a court order, not a settlement. However, the problem might be using \"settlement\" loosely. The document says \"Temporary Restraining Order\", not a settlement. So maybe some items are Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So if the case hasn't settled, then the settlement-related items might be Not Applicable. But the problem is, the checklist is asking for settlement items, and the case is in motion with a TRO, not a settlement. So perhaps these items are Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's checklist definitions:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: \"The substantive obligations agreed to in any settlement\"\n\nBut there's no settlement here; it's a TRO. So maybe all these items are Not Applicable. But the Revised Order has terms, so maybe the user considers the TRO as part of the settlement process. But the checklist says \"settlement\", which typically means an agreement between parties to end the case, not a court order. So perhaps the correct approach is to mark these as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions show that they read the Docket and the Revised Order, and the Docket has entries like \"Order granting Motion for TRO\" (ECF 23), but no settlement. The case is still ongoing, with a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for September 4, 2025. So there's no settlement yet. Therefore, the checklist items related to settlement (terms, date, duration, court-enforced, disputes over enforcement) might not apply because there's no settlement.\n\nBut the checklist says \"any settlement\", so if there's no settlement, then all those items should be marked as Not Applicable. However, the user's instructions say to require explicit evidence for Not Applicable. The evidence would be that the case is ongoing with a TRO, no settlement reached yet.\n\nLooking at the documents: The Docket shows a TRO was granted on 8/7/2025 (ECF 34), and there's a pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 30), with a hearing on 9/4/2025. There's no mention of a settlement agreement. So the case hasn't settled; the TRO is a temporary order. Therefore, the settlement checklist items should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's checklist items are phrased as if there is a settlement. However, the problem states to extract based on the documents. Since there's no settlement, the items are Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the Revised Order (Document 34) is titled \"REVISED TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\", not a settlement. So the terms in the order are court-ordered terms, not a settlement. Therefore, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" doesn't apply because there's no settlement. Similarly, the date of settlement isn't applicable. So all five items should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So I need to find evidence that there's no settlement. The Docket shows that the case is still active, with a preliminary injunction motion pending. For example, the Docket entry 29 says \"RESPONSE In Opposition to 28 MOTION to Amend/Correct 23 Order on Motion for TRO filed by All Defendants.\" And the next entry is the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 30). There's no entry about a settlement agreement.\n\nAlso, the case is titled \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", which is a lawsuit, not a settlement. So the evidence is the absence of any settlement terms in the documents, and the case is still ongoing.\n\nTherefore, for all five checklist items, the correct action is to set them to \"Not Applicable\" using update_checklist.\n\nBut the user's recent actions haven't done that yet. The current status shows all keys are empty. So the next step is to use update_checklist to set each key to \"Not Applicable\" with the appropriate evidence.\n\nWait, but the checklist definitions mention \"settlement\", and the case hasn't settled. So the evidence for Not Applicable would be that the case is ongoing with a TRO and no settlement reached, as per the Docket entries.\n\nFor example, the Docket shows that the TRO was granted on 8/7/2025, and the case is proceeding to a preliminary injunction hearing on 9/4/2025. There's no indication of a settlement.\n\nSo, for each key:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: No settlement, so Not Applicable. Evidence: Case is ongoing with a TRO and pending preliminary injunction, no settlement agreement.\n- Date_of_Settlement: Not Applicable.\n- How_Long_Settlement_will_Last: Not Applicable.\n- Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: Not Applicable.\n- Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: Not Applicable.\n\nBut need to confirm that \"Not Applicable\" is properly encoded as a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence.\n\nSo the next action should be to call update_checklist for all five keys, each with a single entry of \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the documents.\n\nWait, the user's tools allow batching in one update_checklist call. So the patch should include all five keys, each with an extracted list containing one entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence.\n\nThe evidence for each would be similar: \"The case is ongoing with a Temporary Restraining Order (ECF 34, dated 2025-08-07) and a pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 30, hearing scheduled for 2025-09-04); no settlement has been reached as of the latest document (Docket entry 49, 2025-08-25).\"\n\nBut need to cite specific evidence from the documents. The Revised Order (Document 34) is dated 2025-08-07, and the Docket shows the hearing for the preliminary injunction is set for 2025-09-04 (entry 49: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025...\").\n\nSo the evidence is that the case is still active, no settlement mentioned, and the TRO is a court order, not a settlement.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist to set all five keys to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the current status says all keys are empty. So the next step is to update them to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's decision policy says: \"Use `update_checklist` to replace the entire extracted list for some checklist items when you have the authoritative/complete set, when correcting earlier entries, or when setting an item to Not Applicable.\"\n\nSo for each key, set extracted to [\"Not Applicable\"] with evidence.\n\nSo the tool call should be update_checklist with a patch for all five keys.\n\nLet me structure the JSON for the tool call.\n\nThe patch will be an array of objects, each with key and extracted (which is an array of one entry with evidence and value).\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case is ongoing with a Temporary Restraining Order (ECF 34, dated 2025-08-07) and a pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 30, hearing scheduled for 2025-09-04); no settlement has been reached as of the latest document (Docket entry 49, 2025-08-25).\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Docket entries 23, 34, 30, 49\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ... repeat for other keys\n  ]\n}\n\nBut the evidence text should be verbatim snippets. The Docket entries:\n\n- Entry 23: \"ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/2025.\" Wait, but the Revised Order is ECF 34, dated 8/7/25.\n\nWait, the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Document 34) is dated 2025-08-07. The Docket entry 34 is \"AMENDED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order (Amended ECF No. 23 Order granting ECF No. 13 Motion for TRO). So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/7/2025.\"\n\nEntry 49: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM...\"\n\nSo the evidence for each key can be the same, citing these entries.\n\nBut the evidence should be a verbatim snippet. For example, the Docket entry 49 says \"Hearing set for 9/4/2025\", and entry 34 says \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/7/2025.\" But the key point is that the case is still ongoing, no settlement.\n\nThe most direct evidence is that the case is proceeding to a preliminary injunction hearing, so no settlement has been reached. The Docket entries don't mention any settlement.\n\nSo for the evidence, use a snippet from the Docket that shows the case is ongoing. For example, the entry 49 says \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\", indicating the case is active, not settled.\n\nThus, for each key, the evidence would be:\n\n- text: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\"\n- source_document: Docket\n- location: Docket entry 49\n\nBut the exact text from the Docket:\n\n\"None | 2025-08-27 | NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose. (Urizandi, Nissheneyra)\"\n\nSo the verbatim text is \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\"\n\nThis shows the case is ongoing, so no settlement.\n\nTherefore, the evidence for all keys is the same, using this snippet.\n\nSo the update_checklist call should have for each key the evidence as above.\n\nNow, the user's instructions say that for Not Applicable, it's a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\", so each key's extracted list has one entry.\n\nThus, the tool call is update_checklist with a patch for all five keys.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R.

{"step": 5, "run_id": "373f4b58-8c95-4227-a40a-45e76929000a", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:50:11.516110-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user has given me a legal checklist extraction task with five specific items to extract from case documents. The snapshot shows that all five keys have been marked as \"Not Applicable\" based on evidence from the Docket (entry 49), which mentions a hearing scheduled for September 4, 2025. The current status says all keys are marked as Not Applicable, and the documents listed as fully visited are Docket and Revised Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if there's any remaining document that might contain settlement-related information. The available documents include three unvisited ones: Complaint, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, and Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO. But the previous steps have already marked all keys as Not Applicable, and the evidence cited is from the Docket entry 49, which is a notice of hearing for a preliminary injunction, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist items are about settlement terms, date, duration, court enforcement, and disputes over enforcement. The case seems to be in the preliminary injunction phase, not a settlement. The Docket entries show motions for TRO and preliminary injunction, but no settlement has been reached yet. The hearing is scheduled for September 4, 2025, so the case is ongoing, not settled. Therefore, \"Not Applicable\" is correct because there's no settlement yet.\n\nThe user's instructions say that Not Applicable should be used when there's explicit evidence that the item doesn't apply, like a case still in motion without a settlement. The evidence provided (hearing notice) supports that no settlement exists yet. The other unvisited documents might contain more details, but if they're all related to the ongoing case (motions, orders), they likely don't have settlement terms. For example, the Temporary Restraining Order (the document read earlier) doesn't mention a settlement; it's about the TRO.\n\nThe key point is that all five checklist items require settlement-related information. Since the case is still pending a preliminary injunction hearing, there's no settlement to extract. The evidence from Docket entry 49 (hearing notice) confirms the case is ongoing, so the Not Applicable is justified.\n\nNow, checking the current state: all 5 keys are marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The documents that are unvisited (like Complaint, other orders) probably don't contain settlement terms because the case hasn't settled. The user's instructions say not to mark Not Applicable just because you didn't find it; you need explicit evidence. Here, the evidence is the ongoing case status, so it's valid.\n\nThe next action should be to stop because all keys are properly marked as Not Applicable. The system's stop criteria say to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable with supporting evidence. Since all five are Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket, there's no need to read more documents. The unvisited documents are likely irrelevant to settlement terms since the case hasn't settled yet.\n\nI should check if there's any possible settlement mentioned in the unvisited documents. For example, the Complaint might not mention settlement, as it's the initial filing. The motions are for TRO and preliminary injunction, not settlement. The orders are all about restraining orders, not settlements. So, no, there's no settlement information in the remaining documents. Therefore, the current Not Applicable status is correct.\n\nSo, the correct action is to stop. The JSON response should be {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All checklist items correctly marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence from ongoing case status.\"} The reason should be brief, as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items correctly marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence from ongoing case status (hearing scheduled for 9/4/2025; no settlement reached).

The user is asking me to extract specific checklist items from legal case documents, and I'm supposed to follow a strict process.\n\nLooking at the current status, all 5 checklist items have been marked as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Docket (entry 49). The system has already confirmed that all keys are filled, and the documents that might contain settlement information (like the Complaint, Temporary Restraining Orders, etc.) are unvisited, but the evidence provided in the Docket entry 49 clearly shows that the case is still ongoing with a hearing scheduled for September 4, 2025. \n\nThe key point here is that the case hasn't settled yet - it's still in the preliminary injunction phase. The settlement-related checklist items would only apply if a settlement had been reached, but the documents show the case is ongoing. The Docket entry mentions a hearing for the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which confirms no settlement has occurred.\n\nI need to verify if there's any possibility of missing settlement information in the unvisited documents. However, the evidence from the Docket (entry 49) is explicit: the hearing is scheduled for September 4, 2025, meaning the settlement hasn't been reached yet. The other documents listed (Complaint, Motions, etc.) are all pre-settlement procedural documents.\n\nThe decision policy states that Not Applicable should only be marked when there's explicit evidence that the item doesn't apply. Here, the evidence is clear - the case is ongoing, so settlement terms don't exist yet. \n\nThe system has already executed `get_checklist` and confirmed all 5 keys are filled as Not Applicable. There's no need to read any more documents because:\n- The unvisited documents are all procedural filings that wouldn't contain settlement terms (since settlement hasn't happened)\n- The evidence from Docket entry 49 is sufficient and dispositive\n- The checklist requires \"Not Applicable\" only when the item doesn't apply, which is the case here\n\nThe Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are either complete or marked Not Applicable with evidence. This is satisfied. The \"Automatic Checklist Review\" even says it's stop attempt 1/2, meaning the system is ready for the final stop.\n\nI should not call any more tools - the extraction is complete. The JSON response must be strictly {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All checklist items correctly marked as Not Applicable with evidence from ongoing case status (hearing scheduled for 9/4/2025; no settlement reached).\"}\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items correctly marked as Not Applicable with evidence from ongoing case status (hearing scheduled for 9/4/2025; no settlement reached).
