Congress has created a range of grant programs to support those populations, including by securing new housing for domestic violence victims who cannot safely remain at home, by helping prevent sexual assault and domestic violence from occurring in the first place, and by assisting unhoused individuals and families to obtain housing and stay in it long-term. Congress has tasked the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) with administering many of those programs."

Rather than faithfully carrying out the programs Congress created, the Departments are now forcing grantees to agree to various new conditions and certify compliance with various requirements. These new restrictions have no grounding in the relevant statutes and do not aim to better effectuate the programs\u2019 purposes. Instead, they seek to advance the Administration\u2019s wholly unrelated ideological goals\u2014including to end \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,\u201d deny transgender people\u2019s identities, and cut off access to abortion resources and referrals."
