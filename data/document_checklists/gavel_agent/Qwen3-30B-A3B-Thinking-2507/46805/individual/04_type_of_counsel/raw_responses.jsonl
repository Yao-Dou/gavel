The checklist item is empty, and the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and all documents are unvisited. The task is to find every distinct value of counsel type, including specific organizations in parentheses.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is probably the primary document where the parties' counsel would be listed. The Docket might have some info too, but the Complaint is a good starting point.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, the next logical step is to read the Complaint document. The Complaint is 43k tokens, which is a lot, but the first part might have the counsel info. The user should read a window that's likely to contain the relevant sections, like the beginning where the parties and their attorneys are mentioned.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to, say, 10,000 tokens. That's within the 10k limit. The view range will be 0-10000, and then check if the counsel info is there. If not, maybe read another segment later. But since the user can only do one action at a time, starting with the first part of the Complaint makes sense.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief...\" which might also mention counsel. But the Complaint is the foundational document, so it's the best place to start. The other motions might reference the counsel, but the Complaint is more likely to have the initial listing.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Complaint from tokens 0 to 10000. That's the most efficient way to get the initial data. No need for regex yet since the document is unvisited and the info is probably in the beginning.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3415, "completion_tokens": 450, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist says to get the type of counsel for each side, like plaintiff and defendant, using specific categories.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the only one read so far is the Complaint. The user read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint. Let me check that text for any mention of counsel types.\n\nIn the Complaint, the plaintiffs are listed as various coalitions and organizations, like \"Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence\" and others. The defendants are government entities like \"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary...\" and \"United States Department of Health and Human Services.\"\n\nWait, the plaintiffs are all non-profit organizations, so their counsel would be private counsel or maybe public interest groups. But the document doesn't explicitly say \"private counsel\" or \"public interest nonprofit.\" It lists the plaintiffs as organizations, but the actual counsel representing them might not be named here. The complaint is filed by these organizations, but it doesn't state who their lawyers are.\n\nFor the defendants, they are government officials and departments. Government counsel would be the U.S. Department of Justice or government lawyers. But again, the document doesn't explicitly state \"government counsel\" in the text provided. It just lists the defendants as agencies.\n\nThe key instruction says: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" Since the document doesn't mention the counsel types (like \"counsel for plaintiffs is private counsel\"), I can't extract that. The plaintiffs are the organizations themselves, but their legal representation isn't specified here. The defendants are government entities, so their counsel would be government lawyers, but again, the document doesn't say that. It just names the defendants.\n\nSo, in the read text, there's no explicit mention of the type of counsel. The plaintiffs are the organizations, but it's unclear if they're represented by their own counsel or if they're pro se. Wait, the plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations, so they likely have their own counsel, but the document doesn't state that. The complaint is filed by the organizations, so maybe they are represented by their own legal teams, but the text doesn't say \"private counsel\" or anything.\n\nTherefore, since there's no clear evidence of the counsel type in the current document, I can't extract any values for Type_of_Counsel. The next step would be to check other documents. The available documents include Docket, Orders, and Motions. The Docket might have more info on the counsel, like who's representing each side.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, and the key is empty. So I need to look for more documents where the counsel type might be mentioned. The next logical step is to read another document. The Docket is listed as unvisited, so maybe the Docket entry has the counsel information. Alternatively, the Pleading/Motion documents might mention the counsel.\n\nBut the user's previous action was reading the Complaint. Now, the next action should be to read another document. The Docket is the next most likely candidate because court dockets often list counsel for each party.\n\nSo, I should call read_document on the Docket (Docket) document. The Docket is 7,409 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the entire document. Since it's unvisited, I'll read tokens 0-7409.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows \"Docket\" as ○ Unvisited, so it hasn't been read yet. The previous read was on the Complaint, which is partially visited. Now, to get more info, I need to read the Docket. That's the next best step.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14020, "completion_tokens": 823, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist says to find the type of counsel for each side (plaintiff and defendant) using specific categories like private counsel, government counsel, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to check what documents have been read so far. The recent actions show that \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" was read from tokens 0-10000, and the \"Docket\" was fully read (tokens 0-7409). The Docket is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The Complaint was partially read (23% coverage), but the next step is to see if there's enough info there or if I need to read more.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text provided, it lists all the plaintiffs and defendants. The plaintiffs are various non-profit organizations, and the defendants are government entities and officials. The question is about the type of counsel representing each side. \n\nIn the Complaint, the plaintiffs are all organizations, so their counsel would likely be private attorneys. The defendants are government agencies, so their counsel would be government counsel. But the document itself might mention the law firms or the type of representation.\n\nWait, the Complaint starts with the plaintiffs' names and then the defendants. But the actual counsel (lawyers) aren't listed in the excerpt provided. The Docket, which was fully read, shows motions to appear pro hac vice. For example, there are motions for Elizabeth E. Theran, Kristin Bateman, etc., to appear pro hac vice. \"Pro hac vice\" means they're appearing in court for this case but aren't local counsel, so they're private attorneys. The Docket also shows notices of appearance by Lynette J. Labinger and Mary C. Dunn for the plaintiffs, and Lauren Sandler Zurier for the defendants.\n\nWait, the Docket says: \"14 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J. Labinger on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" and \"15 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE of Appearance by Mary C. Dunn on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" and \"16 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE of Appearance by Lauren Sandler Zurier on behalf of All Defendants\".\n\nSo for the plaintiffs, the counsel is Lynette J. Labinger and Mary C. Dunn, who are private attorneys (since they're appearing pro hac vice and their notices mention \"on behalf of All Plaintiffs\"). For the defendants, Lauren Sandler Zurier is appearing on behalf of All Defendants, which would be government counsel since the defendants are government entities. Wait, but government defendants might have government counsel, but sometimes they use private firms. However, the notice says \"on behalf of All Defendants\", and the defendants are government agencies, so it's likely that the government is using its own attorneys, but the notice might indicate it's a private firm. Wait, the Docket entry for the defendants' appearance says \"Lauren Sandler Zurier on behalf of All Defendants\". The name \"Zurier\" is a law firm name? Wait, no, it's the attorney's name. But the key point is whether they're private or government counsel.\n\nThe checklist specifies: \"Type of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se)\".\n\nSince the plaintiffs are non-profits, their counsel is likely private attorneys (not government). The defendants are government entities, so their counsel would be government counsel (e.g., Department of Justice). But in the Docket, the notice of appearance for defendants is by Lauren Sandler Zurier, which might be a private attorney representing the government. Wait, but government defendants often have the Department of Justice (DOJ) handling their representation. The Docket shows \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" as a defendant, so their counsel would be DOJ, which is government counsel.\n\nBut the notice of appearance says \"on behalf of All Defendants\", so the attorney (Lauren Sandler Zurier) is likely part of the DOJ, making it government counsel. However, the Docket entries for the plaintiffs show multiple attorneys (Labinger, Dunn) appearing pro hac vice, which are private attorneys. The \"pro hac vice\" motions (like motion for Kristin Bateman to appear pro hac vice) indicate that these are private attorneys being admitted to represent the plaintiffs.\n\nSo for the plaintiffs, the type of counsel is \"private counsel\", and for the defendants, it's \"government counsel\".\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\".\n\nSo the values would be:\n\n- Plaintiff: private counsel\n- Defendant: government counsel\n\nNow, I need to check if the evidence is present. The Docket shows the notices of appearance. For plaintiffs: Lynette J. Labinger and Mary C. Dunn, and the motions for others to appear pro hac vice (which are private attorneys). For defendants: Lauren Sandler Zurier, who is likely a government attorney (since she's representing government defendants).\n\nThe Docket entry for the defendants' appearance says \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lauren Sandler Zurier on behalf of All Defendants\". The defendants are government entities (HHS, HUD, etc.), so this is government counsel. The plaintiffs' counsel are private attorneys (as indicated by pro hac vice motions, which are for out-of-state attorneys).\n\nSo the evidence for plaintiff counsel is the notices of appearance by Labinger and Dunn, and the pro hac vice motions. For defendant counsel, it's the notice by Zurier.\n\nNow, the Complaint (which was partially read) doesn't mention the counsel, but the Docket does. Since the Docket is fully visited, I can use that to extract the values.\n\nSo the checklist item \"Type_of_Counsel\" should have two entries: 'Plaintiff: private counsel' and 'Defendant: government counsel'.\n\nI need to make sure that these are the correct categories. The checklist examples include \"private counsel\" and \"government counsel\", so this fits.\n\nNow, for the evidence:\n\nFor Plaintiff: private counsel\n- Evidence: Docket entry 14 (NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J. Labinger on behalf of All Plaintiffs), Docket entry 15 (Mary C. Dunn), and the pro hac vice motions (entries 3-11) which are for private attorneys.\n\nFor Defendant: government counsel\n- Evidence: Docket entry 16 (NOTICE of Appearance by Lauren Sandler Zurier on behalf of All Defendants), and since the defendants are government entities, this is government counsel.\n\nI need to confirm that \"government counsel\" is the correct category. Yes, as the defendants are government, their counsel is government counsel.\n\nSo the next step is to append these values to the checklist.\n\nThe current state shows that the key \"Type_of_Counsel\" is empty. So I need to use append_checklist to add these two entries.\n\nEach entry must have evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nFor Plaintiff: private counsel\n- Text: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J. Labinger on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" (from Docket entry 14)\n- Source: Docket\n- Location: Docket entry 14\n\nSimilarly, the pro hac vice motions (entries 3-11) also show private counsel, but since the question is about the type of counsel, the appearance notices are sufficient.\n\nFor Defendant: government counsel\n- Text: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lauren Sandler Zurier on behalf of All Defendants\" (Docket entry 16)\n- Source: Docket\n- Location: Docket entry 16\n\nSo I'll create two entries in the checklist for Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so each side's counsel is a separate value. So 'Plaintiff: private counsel' and 'Defendant: government counsel' are two distinct values.\n\nNow, check if the evidence meets the requirements. Each entry needs evidence with text, source, and location.\n\nFor the Plaintiff entry:\n- value: \"Plaintiff: private counsel\"\n- evidence: [{\"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J. Labinger on behalf of All Plaintiffs\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Entry 14\"}]\n\nSimilarly for Defendant.\n\nBut the checklist requires that the evidence is verbatim. The text in the Docket entry is \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J. Labinger on behalf of All Plaintiffs\", which indicates private counsel (since they're appearing pro hac vice, which is for private attorneys).\n\nWait, but the actual type is \"private counsel\", so the evidence should support that. The Docket entry shows the appearance of private attorneys (pro hac vice), so the value is private counsel.\n\nSimilarly, the defendant's counsel is government counsel, as they're representing government defendants.\n\nSo the append_checklist action should add these two entries.\n\nNow, the next action is to use append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nThe current state shows that the document catalog is known (7 documents), and the Docket is fully visited, so no need to read more. The Complaint was partially read but the relevant info is in the Docket.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the two entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: private counsel\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance by Lynette J.

The user is trying to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from legal documents. So far, they've read the Complaint and the Docket. From the Docket, they found that the plaintiffs have private counsel (with names like Lynette Labinger, Mary Dunn, Kristin Bateman, etc.) and defendants have government counsel (Lauren Sandler Zurier).\n\nThe current status shows that \"Type_of_Counsel\" has two values: one for plaintiffs as \"private counsel\" and one for defendants as \"government counsel\". The Docket is fully visited (100% coverage), so no need to read it again. The Complaint was partially read (only up to 10,000 tokens), but the user already extracted the necessary info from the Docket. \n\nNow, looking at the available documents, the other documents like Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised, Temporary Restraining Order, and the motions are unvisited. But the checklist item is about the type of counsel, which is already covered in the Docket entries. The Docket shows the appearances of attorneys, so the counsel types are already extracted. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the extraction from the Docket includes \"Plaintiff: private counsel\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\". The evidence comes from the Docket entries where attorneys are listed as appearing for plaintiffs or defendants. The Complaint itself lists the plaintiffs as organizations, but the counsel type isn't specified there—only the Docket shows the attorneys' appearances. \n\nSo, the key point here is that the Docket is fully visited, and the necessary info is already extracted. The other documents (like the orders or motions) might not add any new counsel types. For example, the Temporary Restraining Order or the motions might have more attorney appearances, but the user's previous step already used the Docket entries to get the counsel types. \n\nThe checklist requires all distinct values. The current extraction has two values. Are there any other counsel types mentioned elsewhere? The Complaint lists the plaintiffs as organizations (like Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence), but those are the parties, not the counsel. The counsel is the attorneys representing them, which are in the Docket. \n\nThe Docket entries 14, 15, 3, etc., show private counsel for plaintiffs (since they're appearing pro hac vice or as regular counsel), and defendant's counsel is government (Lauren Sandler Zurier, who is a government attorney). \n\nSo, no new information is expected from the remaining documents. The user has already extracted all relevant counsel types. The next step should be to confirm if there are any missing values.
