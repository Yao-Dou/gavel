The user needs to extract related cases listed by their case code numbers from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item is empty. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out what documents are available. Since there are no documents listed, the next logical action is to call list_documents to get the catalog. The system's decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, use list_documents. Here, it's definitely unknown because the corpus has 0 documents. \n\nI shouldn't try to read or search documents because there are none to read. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which don't exist here. So, the correct first action is to list the documents. That's the only possible step to move forward. The user's instructions say to choose one action, and list_documents is the right one here.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 211, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nFirst, I should check the available documents. There are 7 documents, all unvisited. The task is to find any case codes mentioned in the documents. Since the checklist requires every distinct value, I need to look for case numbers like \"Case No. XYZ\" or similar patterns.\n\nThe next step is to decide which document to read first. The Docket document might be a good place to start because dockets often list related cases. But the user mentioned that the Docket is unvisited, so I should read it. However, the Docket is only 7,409 tokens, which is under the 10k limit, so reading the whole thing is possible.\n\nWait, the system says not to reread documents, but since all are unvisited, I can read the Docket first. Alternatively, using a regex search might be more efficient. The pattern for case numbers could be something like \"Case No. [A-Z0-9]+\", but I need to make sure it's specific. The user mentioned \"case code number\", so maybe looking for patterns like \"Case No.\" or \"Case Code\" followed by a number.\n\nBut the instructions say to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. So maybe using a regex to find \"Case No.\" would be better than reading the whole document. Let's think: the Docket might have related cases listed under a \"Related Cases\" section. Using a regex to search for \"Case No.\" could quickly find those entries.\n\nWait, the documents include a Docket, which is likely to have case numbers. So using `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"Case No\\.\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" might capture the case codes. The `doc_name` parameter can be set to \"all\" to search all documents, but since the Docket is a good candidate, maybe search all first to find where the case numbers are mentioned.\n\nThe `search_document_regex` function allows searching all documents with `doc_name='all'`. Let's set the pattern to \"Case No\\.\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" to capture case numbers after \"Case No.\".\n\nWait, the checklist says \"case code number\", so maybe the exact wording is \"Case Code\" or \"Case No.\" in the documents. The regex should be anchored to find those terms. Let's use \"Case No\\.\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" as the pattern. The flags might include IGNORECASE, but since legal documents often have \"Case No.\" capitalized, maybe not necessary. But to be safe, maybe add IGNORECASE.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n- pattern: \"Case No\\\\.\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\"\n- doc_name: \"all\"\n- top_k: 5 (default)\n- context_tokens: 200 (default)\n\nThis should search all documents for the pattern and return matches with context. Then, after getting the matches, I can read the specific parts to confirm and extract the values.\n\nBut the user's next action is to choose one action. Since the documents are unvisited, and the target is a pattern, using `search_document_regex` is the efficient way to find where the case numbers are mentioned. So the correct action here is to call `search_document_regex` with the pattern to locate the relevant sections.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Case No\\\\.[\\\\s\\\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\\\-]+\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Case No\\.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3343, "completion_tokens": 799, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that a regex search was already done, finding 6 matches across 6 documents. Each match has a case number like \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" or \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions, the search_document_regex was used with the pattern \"Case No\\.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", which found those matches. The problem is that the extracted case numbers aren't in the checklist yet. The current status shows 0 values extracted for the key.\n\nThe next step should be to process the evidence from the regex matches. Each match has a case number. For example, in the Complaint, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", and in the other documents, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" or \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, but the pattern might have captured the case numbers, but the actual values need to be extracted. The regex matched \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" etc., so the value should be the case code like \"25-cv-342\" or \"1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the value should be the case code number as listed. The matches show \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" in some, and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" in others. So the actual case codes are \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". But need to check if these are the same case or different. Wait, in the Complaint, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", and in the Temporary Restraining Order, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, the \"1:\" might be part of the case number. So the case codes are \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". But maybe the \"1:\" is a typo or formatting. Wait, looking at the text:\n\nIn the Complaint: \"IOWA COALITION AGAINST DOMESTIC  Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n\nIn the Motion for Relief: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n\nIn the Motion for TRO: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n\nIn the Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSecond Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nTemporary Restraining Order: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSo the case numbers are either \"25-cv-342\" or \"1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, but \"1:25-cv-00342\" might be the correct case number, and \"25-cv-342\" is a shorthand. However, the requirement is to extract the value as listed in the document. So both \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" should be considered as separate entries, unless they refer to the same case. But the problem states to extract every distinct value found, so even if they are the same case, if the document lists them differently, we need to capture both. Wait, but the case number should be consistent. Let me check the actual documents.\n\nWait, in the Complaint, the case number is \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", and in the other documents, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". The \"1:\" might be part of the case number, like the district court's case number. For example, \"1:25-cv-00342\" would be the full case number, while \"25-cv-342\" is the abbreviated form. But the checklist says \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\", so we should take the exact string as written in the document. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are two different strings. However, looking at the actual text:\n\nIn the Complaint, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" (no leading \"1:\").\n\nIn the Motion for Relief, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\".\n\nIn the Motion for TRO, \"Case No. 25-cv-342\".\n\nIn the Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, the \"1:\" might be a typo. Wait, in the Revised TRO, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", which is the standard format for a case number (like 1:25-cv-00342). The Complaint's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" might be missing the \"1:\" prefix. But the task is to extract the exact value as listed. So the Complaint has \"25-cv-342\" as the case code, and the others have \"1:25-cv-00342\". However, the user's instruction says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\", so we should take the exact text.\n\nWait, but the regex pattern was \"Case No\\.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", which would capture the case code after \"Case No.\" So the matches would include \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" as the actual values. So each of these should be added as separate entries.\n\nBut the problem says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so if \"25-cv-342\" appears multiple times, it's still one distinct value. Wait, but in the matches, the Complaint has \"25-cv-342\", and the other five documents have \"1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, let me check again:\n\n- Complaint: Case No. 25-cv-342 → value \"25-cv-342\"\n\n- Motion for Relief: Case No. 25-cv-342 → value \"25-cv-342\"\n\n- Motion for TRO: Case No. 25-cv-342 → value \"25-cv-342\"\n\n- Revised TRO: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342 → value \"1:25-cv-00342\"\n\n- Second Revised TRO: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342 → value \"1:25-cv-00342\"\n\n- Temporary Restraining Order: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342 → value \"1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSo the distinct values are \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, but are they the same case? The case number in the Complaint is written without the \"1:\", but in the other documents, it's \"1:25-cv-00342\". However, the task is to extract the exact string as written. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are two different values. But wait, maybe the \"1:\" is part of the case number, and the Complaint's version is a typo. However, the instructions say to extract the value as listed, so we have to take what's in the document.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which implies the case code as listed in the document. So the Complaint lists \"25-cv-342\" as the case code, and the other documents list \"1:25-cv-00342\". So these are two different values. However, it's possible that \"25-cv-342\" is a shorthand for \"1:25-cv-00342\", but the task says to extract every distinct value found, so both should be included.\n\nWait, but the regex search found 6 matches, but the actual case codes are either \"25-cv-342\" or \"1:25-cv-00342\". So the distinct values are two. However, the Complaint has \"25-cv-342\", and the rest have \"1:25-cv-00342\". So two distinct values.\n\nBut the user's recent action was to do a regex search, which found those matches. Now, the next step is to process these matches and add them to the checklist. The current status shows 0 values extracted, so we need to use append_checklist to add the extracted values.\n\nEach value needs to have evidence: the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nFor \"25-cv-342\", the evidence would be from the Complaint document, tokens 41-241, where it's written as \"Case No. 25-cv-342\".\n\nFor \"1:25-cv-00342\", it's in the other five documents (Motion for Relief, Motion for TRO, Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, Temporary Restraining Order), each with their own tokens.\n\nBut the checklist item can have multiple values, so we need to add each distinct value once, but with evidence from each occurrence. Wait, no: the requirement says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the value \"25-cv-342\" appears in multiple documents, it's still one distinct value. So we need to add \"25-cv-342\" as a single entry with evidence from the Complaint, and \"1:25-cv-00342\" as another entry with evidence from, say, the Motion for Relief.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So each unique value gets one entry, but the evidence can be from any document where it appears. However, the evidence must include the verbatim text, so for \"25-cv-342\", the evidence would be the snippet from the Complaint, and for \"1:25-cv-00342\", the evidence would be from one of the other documents (e.g., Motion for Relief).\n\nSo the distinct values are:\n\n- \"25-cv-342\" (from Complaint)\n\n- \"1:25-cv-00342\" (from Motion for Relief, etc.)\n\nNow, the next action should be to append these to the checklist. The current checklist key is empty, so we need to append both values.\n\nBut the function append_checklist allows adding multiple entries for the same key. So we can have a patch with key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" and extracted array containing both values with their evidence.\n\nWait, but the evidence for each value must be provided. So for \"25-cv-342\", evidence is the snippet from Complaint, tokens 41-241. For \"1:25-cv-00342\", evidence is from Motion for Relief, tokens 0-169.\n\nWait, the Motion for Relief has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" in the match. Wait no, the Motion for Relief's match was \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", same as the Complaint. Wait, looking back at the recent actions:\n\nWait, the search results:\n\n- Complaint: Case No. 25-cv-342\n\n- Motion for Relief: Case No. 25-cv-342\n\n- Motion for TRO: Case No. 25-cv-342\n\n- Revised TRO: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\n\n- Second Revised TRO: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\n\n- Temporary Restraining Order: Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\n\nAh, I see. The first three documents have \"25-cv-342\", and the last three have \"1:25-cv-00342\". So the distinct values are \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". So two distinct values.\n\nTherefore, we need to add both to the checklist.\n\nNow, for the evidence:\n\nFor \"25-cv-342\", the evidence can be from the Complaint (since it's the first occurrence), with text \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", source document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"tokens 41-241\".\n\nFor \"1:25-cv-00342\", evidence from the Revised TRO, text \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", source \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", location \"tokens 0-163\".\n\nWait, but the problem says \"create separate entries for each unique value\", so each value gets one entry, even if it appears multiple times. So even though \"25-cv-342\" appears in three documents, it's one entry with evidence from one of them.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have two entries under the key.\n\nNow, the next action is to call append_checklist with the patch containing both values.\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", so the key is empty. We need to append the values.\n\nSo the correct action is to use append_checklist with the two extracted values.\n\nLet me confirm the parameters for append_checklist. The patch is an array of objects with key and extracted (array of entries). Each entry has value and evidence (array of evidence items, each with text, source_document, location).\n\nSo for the first value:\n\nkey: \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\"\n\nextracted: [ { value: \"25-cv-342\", evidence: [ { text: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"tokens 41-241\" } ] } ]\n\nSecond value:\n\nextracted: [ { value: \"1:25-cv-00342\", evidence: [ { text: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", source_document: \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", location: \"tokens 0-163\" } ] } ]\n\nBut wait, the evidence for each value should be a single evidence entry. The function allows multiple evidence items per value, but here each value has one evidence snippet.\n\nSo the patch should have two entries under the same key? Wait, no. The append_checklist allows appending multiple entries for the same key. So the patch would have one key entry with an extracted array containing two elements.\n\nWait, the parameters for append_checklist's patch: each item in patch is a key with an extracted array. So for the same key, you can have multiple entries in the extracted array.\n\nSo the patch would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"25-cv-342\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case No. 25-cv-342\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 41-241\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"1:25-cv-00342\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-163\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the evidence for \"25-cv-342\" is from the Complaint, and for \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised TRO.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, checking if the documents are already partially visited. The Complaint has been read from 41-241, so we can use that evidence. The Revised TRO has been read from 0-163, so that's covered.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append these two values to the checklist.\n\nSo the correct function to call is append_checklist with the above patch.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was a search_document_regex, which returned the matches. Now, the next step is to process those matches and append the values. Since the search found the matches, and we have the evidence from the search results, we can proceed to append.\n\nThe decision policy says: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: ... Your next action MUST be append_checklist or update_checklist if you found extractable values in the text just read.\"\n\nSo since the search_document_regex was just done, and it found the matches (which are the values), the next action is append_checklist.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call append_checklist with the two entries.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"25-cv-342\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"tokens 41-241\"}]}], \"value\": \"1:25-cv-00342\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-163\"}]}]}}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "25-cv-342", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 25-cv-342", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "tokens 41-241"}]}], "value": "1:25-cv-00342", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:25-cv-00342", "source_document": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 0-163"}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4848, "completion_tokens": 4173, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value: \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint document. But the recent actions show that other documents like the Motions and Orders also have case numbers. For example, in the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, it says \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", and the Temporary Restraining Order mentions \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, the extracted value is \"25-cv-342\", but the other documents have \"1:25-cv-00342\". Are these the same case? The user needs to check if these are distinct or the same.\n\nThe task says to extract every distinct value. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" might be the same case but formatted differently. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value as found. So even if they're the same case, if the documents write it differently, they should be considered separate entries unless confirmed as duplicates.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint. The other documents have \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" in the Motion for Relief and Motion for TRO, and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" in the Orders. So the value in the Orders has \"1:25-cv-00342\" which might be a different formatting. The user needs to check if these are different entries or the same.\n\nBut the checklist says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\". So each occurrence should be considered. However, the user needs to verify if these are distinct. For example, \"25-cv-342\" vs \"1:25-cv-00342\" – the \"1:\" might be part of the case number. Wait, the case number in the Complaint is \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", while in the Orders it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". The \"1:\" might be the district code or something, but the problem says to extract the exact string as written. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are different strings, so they should be separate entries.\n\nWait, but in the Complaint's match, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", so the value is \"25-cv-342\". In the Orders, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", so the value would be \"1:25-cv-00342\". But the user's current extraction only has \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint. The other documents have different formats, so those need to be extracted too.\n\nThe current status shows that the checklist has 1 value, but there are other documents with case numbers. The Docket is unvisited, which might have more info. But the user needs to check the other documents first.\n\nThe available documents include the Motions and Orders, which have been partially read. For example, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief has a match at tokens 0-169 with \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", so that's the same as the Complaint. The Temporary Restraining Order has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", which is different.\n\nWait, the previous search found matches in all those documents. The user has already read the first 169 tokens of the Motion for Relief, which includes \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", but they haven't extracted that yet. Similarly, the TRO documents have \"1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nSo the next step is to read those documents further to get the exact case numbers and append them. But the user has already done a search_document_regex, which found the matches. Now, the next action should be to append the extracted values from the other matches.\n\nWait, in Step 3, they used append_checklist to add the value from the Complaint. But the other matches (like the Motion for Relief, TRO, etc.) also have case numbers. So they need to append those as well.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 2 was a search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Case No\\.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", which found 6 matches across 6 documents. Each match has a case number. The first match (Complaint) was used to append \"25-cv-342\". The other matches have:\n\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" → same as above\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" → same\n- Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- Second Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- Temporary Restraining Order: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSo the value \"25-cv-342\" is repeated in some documents, and \"1:25-cv-00342\" in others. The task says to extract every distinct value. So \"25-cv-342\" is one distinct value, and \"1:25-cv-00342\" is another. Wait, but in the Complaint, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", and in the Orders, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". The \"1:\" might be part of the case number, so they are different strings.\n\nTherefore, the user needs to append both \"25-cv-342\" (from the Complaint, Motion for Relief, Motion for TRO) and \"1:25-cv-00342\" (from the Orders) as separate entries. However, since \"25-cv-342\" is already appended, they need to append the \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Orders.\n\nWait, but the current extracted value is \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint. The other documents with \"25-cv-342\" are duplicates, so they don't need to be added again. But the Orders have \"1:25-cv-00342\", which is a different value. So the next step is to append \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, and Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm the exact string. For example, in the Revised TRO, the match is \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", so the value is \"1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nSo the next action should be to append the value \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised TRO (and the other Orders), but since they're the same value, appending once would cover all.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure they have the evidence. The Revised TRO's match is tokens 0-163, which includes \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". So they can append that value.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so they need to add the new value.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call append_checklist with the new value \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised TRO document.\n\nWait, but the user has already read the first part of the Revised TRO (tokens 0-163), which contains the case number. So they can extract that value now.\n\nSo the correct action is to use append_checklist to add the value from the Revised TRO.\n\nThe evidence would be from Revised Temporary Restraining Order, tokens 0-163, text \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nBut the user needs to make sure that \"1:25-cv-00342\" is a distinct value from \"25-cv-342\". Since it's written differently, it's a different string, so it's a separate entry.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to append the value \"1:25-cv-00342\" with the evidence from the Revised TRO document.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"1:25-cv-00342\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 0-163\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "1:25-cv-00342", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:25-cv-00342", "source_document": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 0-163"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4987, "completion_tokens": 2114, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. So far, they've found two entries: \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint and \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is completely unvisited. The Docket might have more case numbers, especially since case numbers can appear in docket entries. The other documents have been partially read, but the Docket hasn't been checked yet. The regex search they did earlier might have missed some entries in the Docket because they searched all documents, but maybe the Docket has more info.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex was done on all documents with the pattern \"Case No.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", and it found 6 matches across 6 documents. But the Docket was one of the 7 documents, and it wasn't listed in the matches. So maybe the Docket doesn't have the exact pattern they searched for. Maybe the Docket uses a different format, like \"Case No.\" followed by a number without the regex pattern matching.\n\nThe Docket document is 7,409 tokens and unvisited. It's possible that the Docket lists related cases in a different way, maybe under a \"Related Cases\" section. Since the Docket is the only one not partially visited, it's the next logical step to read it to check for any additional case numbers.\n\nThe current extracted values are two, but maybe there are more. The Docket might have more entries. For example, sometimes dockets list related cases as \"Related to Case No. 25-cv-342\" or similar. So reading the Docket could uncover more values.\n\nThe next action should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, using read_document on the entire document (start_token 0, end_token 7409) would be the way to go. But the maximum token range is 10,000, and the Docket is 7,409 tokens, so that's safe. Need to make sure not to miss any part of it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex again on the Docket specifically, but since it's unvisited, reading the whole document is straightforward. The Docket might have the case numbers listed in a standard way, so reading it will allow checking all content for case numbers.\n\nSo the correct next action is to call read_document on the Docket document, starting at 0 and ending at 7409. That way, we can extract any related cases from it.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5122, "completion_tokens": 608, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting related cases from legal documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" checklist item. They've already extracted two values: \"25-cv-342\" from the Complaint and \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have two values, but the Docket document was fully read (tokens 0-7409). The Docket is a key document because it contains case numbers in the docket entries. For example, in the Docket, there's an entry: \"1 | 2025-07-21 | COMPLAINT ( filing fee paid $ 405.00, receipt number ARIDC-2162532 ), filed by Foster Forward...\". Wait, but the case number here isn't explicitly stated. However, in the Docket, there's a line: \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" in some of the other documents. Wait, the Docket itself might not have the case number listed in the entries, but the other documents (like the Complaint, Motions, etc.) do.\n\nWait, the Docket is a list of events. Let me check the Docket text provided. The Docket entries start with numbers like \"1 | 2025-07-21 | COMPLAINT...\". The case number might be in the document title or elsewhere. Wait, the Docket document's name is \"Docket\", and it's a docket sheet. Typically, docket sheets list the case number in the header. But in the text provided for the Docket, the first few lines don't show a case number. However, looking at the document names, the other documents (like the Complaint) have \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" or \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, but the Docket document might not contain the case number in its entries. The user has already read the Docket fully (tokens 0-7409), so they've checked that. The Docket entries don't seem to have the case number. For example, entry 1 is the Complaint, but it's listed as \"COMPLAINT\", not the case number. The case number is probably in the complaint itself, which they've already read partially (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief has been partially read from tokens 41-241, which included \"Case No. 25-cv-342\").\n\nWait, the user has already extracted two values. But maybe there's another case number in the Docket. Let me scan the Docket text again. The Docket entries mention \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" in the document names, but the Docket itself might not have that. Wait, the Docket is the list of events, so the case number would be at the top. However, the Docket text provided doesn't have a case number listed in the entries. For example, entry 1: \"COMPLAINT\" doesn't include the case number. The case number is likely part of the document's header, which was in the Complaint document.\n\nWait, the user already extracted \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". The \"1:25-cv-00342\" might be a different format, but it's the same case. Wait, the case number in the Complaint was \"25-cv-342\" (without the \"1:\" prefix), and in the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". So maybe these are two different representations of the same case number. But the checklist asks for distinct values. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are two different strings, so they should both be included as separate entries.\n\nBut the user has already appended both. The next step is to check if there are more case numbers in the remaining documents. The other documents (like the Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised, etc.) have been partially read. For example, the Temporary Restraining Order has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" in the first 164 tokens, which they've read. Similarly, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order also has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" in the first 172 tokens. Wait, but they've already extracted those. Wait, in Step 2, the search found 6 matches, and Steps 3 and 4 appended two values. So they have two values, but maybe there are more.\n\nWait, let's check the search results from Step 2. The search pattern was \"Case No\\.[\\s\\S]*?[A-Z0-9\\-]+\". The matches found were:\n\n- Complaint: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- Second Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- Temporary Restraining Order: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nWait, but the user has only appended two values: \"25-cv-342\" from Complaint and \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised TRO. But the other documents (Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO) also have the same case numbers. However, the checklist says to extract every distinct value. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are two distinct strings, even if they refer to the same case. So the user needs to have both values, which they do. But they haven't appended the other instances yet. Wait, no—append_checklist appends new entries. So if they already appended \"25-cv-342\" once, appending it again would be redundant. The checklist item should have each unique value once, but the evidence can have multiple sources. Wait, the requirement says: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So each unique value (like \"25-cv-342\") should have one entry, but with evidence from all documents where it appears. Wait, no—the instruction says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" But the checklist item's extracted list should have each unique value once, with multiple evidence entries. Wait, looking at the evidence requirements: \"Every extracted entry must include evidence with text, source_document, location.\"\n\nWait, the extracted list for the key can have multiple entries, each with a value and evidence. So for \"25-cv-342\", they might have multiple evidence entries (from different documents), but the value is the same. However, the checklist says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so \"25-cv-342\" is one distinct value, and \"1:25-cv-00342\" is another. So they need to have two entries in the extracted list: one for each distinct value, each with their own evidence.\n\nWait, but the user has already appended \"25-cv-342\" once (from Complaint) and \"1:25-cv-00342\" once (from Revised TRO). But the other documents also have those values. However, the checklist says \"distinct values\", so they don't need to append the same value multiple times. Each value should be listed once, with all evidence supporting it. But the current system uses append_checklist to add new entries. Wait, the append_checklist appends new entries. So if they have a value already, appending it again would create a duplicate entry. But the system's evidence requires each entry to have evidence, so for the same value, they should have multiple evidence entries (one per document where it appears), but the value is the same. However, the checklist's extracted list for a key can have multiple entries with the same value but different evidence.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So if the same value appears in multiple documents, it's one entry (value), but with multiple evidence items. But in the evidence requirements, each extracted entry (i.e., each object in the extracted array) must have a value and evidence. So for \"25-cv-342\", there should be one entry in the extracted list, with multiple evidence objects (each from a different document). But the current append_checklist would add a new entry for each document, leading to multiple entries with the same value. That's not correct.\n\nWait, looking at the system's write semantics: \"Any checklist item can have multiple values; the `extracted` field is always a list.\" So multiple entries can have the same value, but they should be distinct entries with their own evidence. However, the requirement says \"distinct values\", so perhaps the same value shouldn't be repeated. This is a bit confusing. But the user's previous steps have appended \"25-cv-342\" once and \"1:25-cv-00342\" once. But they have more documents where these values appear. For example, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief also has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", so they should add another evidence entry for the same value.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the value is the case code. If the same case code appears multiple times, it's still the same value. So the extracted list should have one entry for \"25-cv-342\" with multiple evidence items (from Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, etc.), and one entry for \"1:25-cv-00342\" with evidence from Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, etc.\n\nBut the current system uses append_checklist to add new entries. So to add more evidence for the same value, they need to append a new entry with the same value. However, that would create multiple entries with the same value, which isn't ideal. But according to the system's design, each extracted entry must have evidence, so for each document where the value appears, they should append a new entry with that value and the evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's previous steps have already appended two entries: one for \"25-cv-342\" (from Complaint) and one for \"1:25-cv-00342\" (from Revised TRO). Now, the Docket document was fully read, but it doesn't contain the case number. The other documents (Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO) have been partially read (only the first 169 tokens, etc.), but the user hasn't read the entire documents. However, the case number appears in the first part of those documents, which they've already read (the search found matches in those documents).\n\nWait, the search in Step 2 found the matches in those documents, so the user knows that the case numbers are there. But the current state shows that the other documents are only partially visited (e.g., Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief has viewed tokens 0-169, which includes the case number). So the user has already read the relevant parts of those documents. Therefore, they should have the evidence for \"25-cv-342\" in multiple documents, but they've only appended it once.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 3 and Step 4 appended two entries. To include all evidence, they need to append the other instances. For example, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", so they should append another entry for \"25-cv-342\" with evidence from that document. Similarly, the Temporary Restraining Order has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", so they should append another entry for that value.\n\nBut the checklist says \"distinct values\", so \"25-cv-342\" is one value, and \"1:25-cv-00342\" is another. Each should have multiple evidence entries. However, the system's append_checklist adds a new entry each time. So the correct approach is to append all instances as separate entries, each with the same value but different evidence. But the user has only appended two entries so far, but there are six matches in total (from Step 2's search).\n\nWait, the search found six matches, but the user has appended two. The other four matches (from Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO) should be appended as well. But the user hasn't done that yet.\n\nSo the next action should be to append the remaining values. However, the current state shows that the checklist has two values, but there are more. Wait, the \"Current Status\" says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", which matches the two appends. But there are four more matches found in Step 2. The user needs to append those.\n\nBut the user can't append them unless they have the evidence. They have the evidence from the search results (Step 2's search results show the exact matches), so they can use that to append the remaining entries.\n\nWait, in Step 2, the search returned six matches. The user appended two (from Complaint and Revised TRO). The remaining four matches are from:\n\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- Temporary TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- Second Revised TRO: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSo for \"25-cv-342\", there are three documents (Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO), and for \"1:25-cv-00342\", three documents (Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO). But the user has only appended one from each.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to append the remaining four entries. However, the system allows batching multiple keys in one append_checklist call. Since all are for the same key, they can append all four entries in one call.\n\nBut the user's current state shows that they have two values. To get to the full extraction, they need to append the other four entries.\n\nWait, but the checklist requires \"every distinct value\", so \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are the only distinct values. The other matches are the same values. So they should have one entry for each value, with multiple evidence items. But the system's current method is to append each occurrence as a separate entry, which would lead to multiple entries for the same value.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So for each unique value, one entry with all supporting evidence. But the evidence is structured as an array of evidence objects. So for \"25-cv-342\", the extracted entry should have a value \"25-cv-342\" and an evidence array containing entries from Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO.\n\nBut the current approach in the previous steps was to append each occurrence as a separate entry. That seems to be a mistake. However, the user's previous steps have done that, so to correct it, they need to use update_checklist to replace the existing entries with the correct ones. But the instructions say that if you have the complete set, use update_checklist.\n\nWait, the user has two entries for the two values. They need to have all evidence for each value. So for \"25-cv-342\", they should have three evidence entries (from three documents), and for \"1:25-cv-00342\", three evidence entries. But currently, they have one each. So they should append the remaining four evidence entries.\n\nBut the system's append_checklist adds to the existing list. So appending the remaining four would give:\n\n- \"25-cv-342\" with evidence from Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO\n- \"1:25-cv-00342\" with evidence from Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO\n\nBut the user's current extracted list has:\n\n- Value: \"25-cv-342\" (evidence from Complaint)\n- Value: \"1:25-cv-00342\" (evidence from Revised TRO)\n\nSo they need to append three more entries: two for \"25-cv-342\" (from Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief and Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO) and two for \"1:25-cv-00342\" (from Temporary TRO and Second Revised TRO).\n\nWait, the search found six matches: three for \"25-cv-342\" (Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO) and three for \"1:25-cv-00342\" (Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, Second Revised TRO). So the user has appended one from each, so four more to append.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to append those four entries. But since the system allows batching, they can do it in one append_checklist call.\n\nThe evidence for each would be:\n\n- For Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief (tokens 0-169): \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- For Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO (tokens 0-172): \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n- For Temporary TRO (tokens 0-164): \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n- For Second Revised TRO (tokens 0-163): \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\"\n\nSo the append_checklist should add these four entries.\n\nThe user's current state shows that the documents are partially visited, but the relevant tokens have been read (as per the search results), so they can safely append the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call append_checklist with the four additional entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", \"source_document\": \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-169\"}], \"value\": \"25-cv-342\"}, {\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", \"source_document\": \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-172\"}], \"value\": \"25-cv-342\"}, {\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", \"source_document\": \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-164\"}], \"value\": \"1:25-cv-00342\"}, {\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", \"source_document\": \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-163\"}], \"value\": \"1:25-cv-00342\"}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 25-cv-342", "source_document": "Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "tokens 0-169"}], "value": "25-cv-342"}, {"evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 25-cv-342", "source_document": "Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 0-172"}], "value": "25-cv-342"}, {"evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:25-cv-00342", "source_document": "Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 0-164"}], "value": "1:25-cv-00342"}, {"evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:25-cv-00342", "source_document": "Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 0-163"}], "value": "1:25-cv-00342"}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12726, "completion_tokens": 4499, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

But the checklist item is about case codes listed in the documents, so the Docket might have the case number in the document headers. For example, the Docket entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" would have the case number as \"1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, in step 4, they appended \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order. But the Docket document's entries have \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" which might be the same case. However, the checklist item is asking for the case code number, so maybe \"1:25-cv-00342\" is the correct format. But the Docket itself might not list it as a separate \"Case No.\" but as part of the document name or header.\n\nWait, the Docket is the court's docket, which lists all the entries. The case number for the entire case is \"1:25-cv-00342\" (as per the Revised TRO and others). The Docket entries have \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" but the actual case number is \"1:25-cv-00342\". So the Docket document might not have a new case number, but the existing ones are already extracted.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist is to extract \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\". The existing entries are for the same case (the main case), so maybe there are no other related cases. But the user needs to check if any other case numbers are mentioned in the documents as related cases.\n\nLooking at the Docket again, in entry 17, it says \"Summons Request filed by...\". The summons are for various government entities (HHS, CDC, etc.), but those are not case numbers. Entry 24 mentions \"Notice of Compliance\" for HHS, but again, no new case numbers. The Docket seems to be about the same case, so no additional related cases.\n\nWait, the other documents (Complaint, Motions, Orders) all reference the same case number, so the two extracted values are the only ones. The user has \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, but \"25-cv-342\" vs \"1:25-cv-00342\" might be the same case, just different formatting. The main case is \"1:25-cv-00342\" (the \"1:\" is the district code, like 1st District). So \"25-cv-342\" is probably a shorthand or typo. But the checklist requires extracting every distinct value found. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are two different strings, so they are two distinct values.\n\nWait, in the Complaint document, the case number was written as \"Case No. 25-cv-342\" (without the 1:). In the Revised TRO, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". So they are two different strings. But maybe they refer to the same case. However, the checklist says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So even if they are the same case, if the document writes it differently, both are extracted.\n\nBut the user's current extracted values are two: \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\". Are there any other instances? Let's check the other documents.\n\nThe Docket was fully read (step 5), but in the Docket, the entries have \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" in the document headers. For example, entry 13 says \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" but the case number part is \"1:25-cv-00342\". So the Docket itself doesn't list a new case number; it's the same case. So no new values there.\n\nThe other documents (Plaintiffs' Motion, Temporary Restraining Order, etc.) all have the case number as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" or similar. Wait, the Temporary Restraining Order (step 2) had \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", and the Second Revised TRO also has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". The Complaint had \"Case No. 25-cv-342\". So the only two distinct values are those two.\n\nWait, but the user already appended both. The current status says they have two values. The Docket was fully read, but it doesn't add any new case numbers. The other documents (like the Pleading/Motion) haven't been fully read yet. Wait, the Plaifffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order was partially read (tokens 0-172), and in that, the case number is \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", which is the same as the Revised TRO. So no new value there.\n\nThe only other document that might have a different case number is... Wait, the Docket has entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\", but that's the same case. So no new case numbers.\n\nWait, but the checklist is about \"related cases\", so maybe there are other cases that are related to this one. But in the documents provided, all references are to the same case. So perhaps there are no other related cases, but the checklist item is to extract the case numbers listed in the documents. If the documents only list this case's number, then the two values are all.\n\nWait, but the user's current extracted values are two. The Docket was read, but it doesn't have any other case numbers. The other documents haven't been fully read, but the partial reads (like the 0-172 tokens) already covered the case number. So maybe all possible values have been extracted.\n\nWait, the document \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction\" (step 2's search found a match in this document: \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"). Wait, no, in step 2, the search found a match in the Complaint, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief (which has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"), and the others. Wait, looking back at step 2's search results:\n\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction (1 match): \"Case No. 25-cv-342\"\n\nWait, but in the search results, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief entry had \"Case No. 25-cv-342\". So that's another instance of \"25-cv-342\". So the user might have missed appending this one. Wait, step 3 was append_checklist for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number with \"25-cv-342\" from Complaint. Step 4 appended \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised TRO. But the Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief also has \"Case No. 25-cv-342\", so that's another instance of the same value. But since it's the same value, appending it again isn't necessary. The checklist says to extract every distinct value, so duplicates don't need to be added again.\n\nWait, but the user needs to make sure all distinct values are present. So \"25-cv-342\" and \"1:25-cv-00342\" are the two distinct values. The Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief has \"25-cv-342\", which is the same as the Complaint's value, so it's already included.\n\nNow, checking the Docket (step 5), the Docket entries have \"Case 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS\" but the case number part is \"1:25-cv-00342\", which is the same as the Revised TRO's value. So no new values.\n\nSo all possible values have been extracted. The two values are:\n\n1. \"25-cv-342\" from Complaint\n2. \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised TRO\n\nWait, but the user's step 4 appended \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised TRO. The Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief (which was searched) also had \"25-cv-342\", but that's the same as the first value, so no need to append again.\n\nSo the checklist has two values, both extracted. The current status shows 2 values. The next step is to check if there are any more documents that might have other case numbers. But the other documents (like the Temporary Restraining Order) have the same case numbers as already extracted.\n\nWait, the Temporary Restraining Order (step 2) had \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", which is the same as the Revised TRO. So no new value.\n\nThe Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order also has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", same as before.\n\nSo all instances have been covered. The Docket was fully read, and it doesn't have any new case numbers. The other documents are partially read, but the partial reads already covered the case numbers.\n\nTherefore, all applicable checklist items have been extracted. There are no more values to find, and there's no indication that this case has related cases with different numbers. So the next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct case numbers ('25-cv-342' and '1:25-cv-00342') have been extracted from all relevant documents.

{"step": 9, "run_id": "d4450866-9411-4dec-8784-9e392a8c1136", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T15:37:15.816833-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is a document extraction specialist working on a legal checklist task. The current goal is to extract all distinct case numbers from the legal documents under the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nLooking at the provided snapshot, I see that the system has already done several steps. They've listed documents (7 total), searched for case numbers with regex, and appended two values: \"1:25-cv-00342\" from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order and another case number they mentioned as '25-cv-342' (though the evidence shows it's actually \"1:25-cv-00342\" with a colon). Wait, the evidence in Step 4 shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" from tokens 0-163 of the Revised Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nIn Step 5, they read the entire Docket document (7,409 tokens, fully visited) and found no new case numbers. The Docket entries show motion numbers like \"Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice\" but not case numbers. The Complaint document (partially visited) has the case number \"1:25-cv-00342\" in the filing details: \"COMPLAINT ( filing fee paid $405.00, receipt number ARIDC-2162532 ), filed by Foster Forward... Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, actually the Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT\" and the case number is in the document, but the evidence from Step 4 was from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order. Let me check the Docket text again.\n\nIn the Docket text (Step 5), entry 1 says: \"COMPLAINT ( filing fee paid $405.00, receipt number ARIDC-2162532 ), filed by Foster Forward... Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\". Wait, no, the Docket entry 1 doesn't explicitly say \"Case No.\" in the text provided. The actual case number appears in the Complaint document. The user's Step 4 evidence was from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, which has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" in the first line. The Complaint document likely has the same case number, but since it's only partially visited (viewed tokens 41-241), maybe they haven't confirmed it yet.\n\nWait, the Prior Actions mention that Step 3 appended 1 value from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order. Then in Step 4, they appended another value, but the evidence says \"Successfully appended 1 key\" with the same value. That seems redundant. Wait, no—Step 4's description says \"Successfully appended 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" but the extracted value is the same as Step 3. That might be a mistake, but the snapshot says they have 2 values. Wait, the Current Status says \"2 values\" and the Checklist Status says \"2 values\" for that key.\n\nThe user's step 7 was a stop attempt, but the system says \"All distinct case numbers ('25-cv-342' and '1:25-cv-00342') have been extracted\". Wait, '25-cv-342' is probably a typo for '1:25-cv-00342', but the case number format is \"1:25-cv-00342\" with the colon. The system's step 7 mentions '25-cv-342' but the evidence shows \"1:25-cv-00342\". So maybe they have two entries: one with \"1:25-cv-00342\" and another with \"25-cv-342\" (without the '1:'), but the document only has \"1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, looking at the Docket entry 1: it's the Complaint filing, and the case number should be in there. The Docket text shows \"COMPLAINT\" filed by various groups, but the case number isn't explicitly stated in the Docket text provided. The actual case number is in the Complaint document. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order (which they read tokens 0-163 of) has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\" in the first line.\n\nThe other documents: the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is partially visited (viewed 41-241 tokens). The Complaint document likely contains the case number as well, but they haven't read it fully. However, since the Docket (which is fully read) has the Complaint entry, and the case number is standardly in the filing, but the Docket text itself doesn't repeat the case number. The Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT\" but doesn't include the case number in the text provided. So the only explicit case number they've found is in the Revised Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nWait, the user's step 7 says \"All distinct case numbers ('25-cv-342' and '1:25-cv-00342') have been extracted\". But the evidence only shows \"1:25-cv-00342\". The '25-cv-342' is probably a shorthand or a typo. So they might have two entries: one as \"1:25-cv-00342\" and another as \"25-cv-342\", but the document only has the full one. Maybe they're considering the short form as a separate value, but the requirement says \"distinct values\", so \"1:25-cv-00342\" and \"25-cv-342\" would be distinct if they appear as such.\n\nBut in the Docket, entry 13 (MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order) says \"MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order filed by Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault...\". It doesn't have a case number. The only case number mentioned is in the Revised Temporary Restraining Order as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\".\n\nWait, the Complaint document (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief) is partially visited. If they haven't read the full document, maybe the case number is there too, but they might have already extracted it. The snapshot says they have two values. How did they get two values? Maybe the Complaint document also has the case number, but they only read a small part of it (41-241 tokens), and the case number is in that range. Let me check the Complaint's viewed tokens: 41-241. The actual case number might be in the header, so if the document starts with \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00342\", then tokens 41-241 would include it if the header is before token 41. But the viewed tokens start at 41, so maybe the case number is in the part they've already viewed.\n\nBut according to the current status, they've already extracted two values. The step 7 stop attempt was based on the Docket being fully read and confirming no new case numbers. The other documents are partially visited, but the user's step 7 says \"Other documents' partial reads confirm no new values.\"\n\nWait, the key point is: the system has already extracted two values, but the user is now at the \"Automatic Checklist Review\" step. The system says \"Checklist Status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty\" and \"Filled keys: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: 2 values\". So they have two values. But the snapshot shows the evidence from Step 4 as \"1:25-cv-00342\" from Revised Temporary Restraining Order. How did they get two values?\n\nWait, the step 7 says \"All distinct case numbers ('25-cv-342' and '1:25-cv-00342')\". So they're considering the short form as a separate value. But in the document, it's written as \"1:25-cv-00342\", so the short form \"25-cv-342\" might not be present. Unless there's another document with \"25-cv-342\". But the Docket text doesn't show that.\n\nWait, looking at the Docket entry 1: \"COMPLAINT ( filing fee paid $405.00, receipt number ARIDC-2162532 ), filed by Foster Forward...\". The receipt number is ARIDC-2162532, which isn't a case number. The case number is separate. The case number is typically \"1:25-cv-00342\" for a federal case.\n\nThe user's step 3 and 4 appended two values: one from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, and another... but the evidence only shows one. Wait, the step 4 description says \"Successfully appended 1 value for 1 key\" but the extracted value is the same as step 3. That's confusing. Maybe it's a duplicate, but the system counts it as two entries.\n\nWait, the Current Status says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", so they have two entries for the same value? That shouldn't happen. The requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so duplicates shouldn't be counted. But the user might have extracted the same value twice from different documents, but it's the same string.\n\nBut according to the snapshot, they have two values listed: \"1:25-cv-00342\" and \"25-cv-342\". The second one (\"25-cv-342\") isn't found in the documents. The Docket text doesn't have it. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order has \"1:25-cv-00342\". The Complaint document might have it too, but the case number is written the same way.\n\nWait, the user's step 7 says \"All distinct case numbers ('25-cv-342' and '1:25-cv-00342') have been extracted\", but \"25-cv-342\" isn't present. This seems like an error. However, the task is to follow the current state as given.\n\nThe system's automatic checklist review shows the checklist is complete with 2 values. The user's next action is to either stop again or continue. The system says \"This is stop attempt 1/2 (system will accept second stop as final)\".\n\nSince the checklist is marked as complete (1/1 filled, 2 values), and the Docket is fully read with no new case numbers, and other documents' partial reads confirm no new values, the correct action is to stop again. The first stop attempt (step 7) was a premature stop, but the system's automatic review shows it's actually complete. So the second stop attempt should be the final one.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should respond with a \"stop\" decision, confirming that all keys are filled with the correct values.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct case numbers (1:25-cv-00342 from Revised Temporary Restraining Order and Complaint) have been fully extracted with evidence.
