The next step should be to list the documents to find out what's in the corpus.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are zero documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the available documents. That's the first action required here. No other actions make sense because there's nothing to read or search without knowing the documents.\n\nSo the correct move is to call list_documents.

The user needs to extract the Date_of_Settlement from legal documents. The checklist item requires all distinct settlement dates with their events, formatted as '[date]: [event]'.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. The Document Catalog shows 7 unvisited documents. The task is to find the settlement date, which might be in any of these. Since none have been read yet, the next step should be to read a document that's most likely to contain the settlement date.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is the main complaint, which might not have settlement dates. The motions (like \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\") might mention settlement, but usually, motions are about requests, not settlements. The Docket might list dates, but it's a summary. The Orders (like Temporary Restraining Orders) could have dates, but they're likely about the orders themselves, not settlements.\n\nWait, settlement dates would typically be in a settlement agreement or a court order approving the settlement. The available documents don't include a \"Settlement Agreement\" or \"Final Judgment\" but there's a \"Docket\" which might list entries related to settlement. The Docket is a good candidate because court dockets often have dates of settlement entries.\n\nThe Docket document is 7,409 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. But the user's instruction says not to reread, and this is unvisited. So, using read_document on the Docket seems right. The Docket might have entries like \"Settlement entered on [date]\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a motion mentions settlement. But the Docket is more likely to have the actual date. Let me check the document names again. The Docket is listed as [Docket], which is a standard place to find dates of court actions, including settlements.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The parameters need start_token and end_token. Since it's unvisited, start_token=0, end_token=7409 (the total tokens). Wait, but the tool requires start_token inclusive and end_token exclusive. So for the whole document, start=0, end=7409.\n\nI'll call read_document on \"Docket\" with those tokens. That should give the text to search for settlement dates.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3430, "completion_tokens": 547, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Date_of_Settlement from the legal documents. The user provided the snapshot, which includes the Docket document that's already fully read (tokens 0-7409). But looking at the Docket entries, I don't see any settlement dates mentioned. The dates there are mostly about motions, hearings, and orders related to TRO (Temporary Restraining Order), but not a settlement.\n\nThe checklist item specifically says to extract settlement dates, including execution, court approval, amendment, enforcement, termination dates, but not when incorporated into a judgment. The Docket has orders granting TROs and amending them, but the TRO isn't a settlement. So the Docket doesn't have the settlement date.\n\nNow, checking the available documents: the Docket is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, Temporary Restraining Order, and two motions. The Settlement Date is likely in one of the orders or motions related to settlement, but the Docket didn't mention a settlement. Wait, the case might not have settled yet, so maybe the Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable. But the user's instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable without explicit evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist definitions say: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" So if there's no settlement mentioned, maybe it's Not Applicable. But the instructions require explicit evidence. The Docket has orders for TRO, but no settlement. The other documents might have settlement terms, but since they're unvisited, I need to check them.\n\nThe next step is to look for documents that might contain settlement dates. The \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" and similar documents might have dates, but TROs aren't settlements. Wait, the checklist is for settlement date, so unless there's a settlement agreement mentioned, there's no date. The Docket shows TROs being granted and amended, but no settlement. The Complaint is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, not a settlement. The motions are for TRO and preliminary injunction.\n\nSince the Docket is fully read and no settlement date found, and the other documents are unvisited, I should check if any of them might contain a settlement. But the user's instructions say to use the most efficient method. The settlement date is a specific item, so maybe a regex search for \"settlement\" followed by dates. The regex pattern could be something like \"settlement\\s+\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" or similar.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" etc., which might have dates. But the Docket already shows the TRO orders with dates (e.g., 7/28/2025, 8/7/2025, 8/20/2025), but those are TRO dates, not settlement. The checklist specifies settlement, so those dates don't count. So if there's no settlement mentioned anywhere, then Date_of_Settlement should be Not Applicable. But the system requires explicit evidence for Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions show that Step 2 was reading the Docket, which didn't have settlement dates. The current status says all keys are empty. The next step is to check other documents. But the problem is, the documents like \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" are orders, not settlements. So maybe the case hasn't settled yet, so the Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable.\n\nBut according to the Not Applicable encoding rules, I need to have explicit evidence. For example, if the case is ongoing and there's no settlement mentioned, maybe a statement like \"no settlement reached\" or \"case is ongoing without settlement.\" However, the Docket doesn't mention settlement at all. The Complaint is about seeking relief, not a settlement. The motions are for TRO and preliminary injunction.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct action is to check the other documents to confirm. But since the Docket is fully read and the other documents are unvisited, maybe I should use search_document_regex to look for \"settlement\" in all unvisited documents. The pattern could be \"settlement\" followed by a date. If no matches, then set to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the available documents are all unvisited except Docket. So the next logical step is to search the unvisited documents for the term \"settlement\" to see if there's any mention. If there's no mention, then the Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable. But I need to confirm.\n\nThe correct action here would be to use search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement\" to check all unvisited documents. Since the Docket was already read and no settlement found, searching other documents is the way to go. So the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement\" to see if any documents contain that term, which might indicate a settlement date.\n\nWait, but the checklist says to extract dates related to settlement, so the regex should look for dates with \"settlement\". However, the regex pattern for search_document_regex should be designed to find settlement-related dates. But the user's instructions say to use precise patterns. Maybe a pattern like \"settlement\\s+(?:execution|signing|approval|amendment|enforcement|termination|date)\\s*[:\\s]*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" but that's complicated. Alternatively, since the task is to extract dates, maybe first search for \"settlement\" and then check the context.\n\nBut the function requires a pattern. The user's example says to use \"Case No.\", \"Filed:\", etc. So perhaps a simple pattern \"settlement\" would be sufficient to find relevant sections, then read those sections to get the dates.\n\nSo, the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement\" across all documents (doc_name='all'), since the other documents are unvisited. Then, based on the matches, read those sections to extract the dates.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Date_of_Settlement\", so the pattern should target dates related to settlement. However, the regex might not be perfect, but it's better to search for \"settlement\" first. So the tool call would be search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement\", doc_name='all', top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nYes, that's the right approach. So the next action is to perform a regex search for \"settlement\" in all documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"settlement\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "settlement", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11034, "completion_tokens": 1457, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Date_of_Settlement.\n\nLooking at the current status: all keys are empty, and the only key to extract is Date_of_Settlement. The recent actions show that Step 1 was list_documents, Step 2 was read_document on Docket (which is fully visited), and Step 3 was a search for \"settlement\" across all documents, which found 0 matches.\n\nThe Docket document is already fully read (tokens 0-7409), and the search didn't find anything. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised, Temporary Restraining Order, and two motions. Since the search for \"settlement\" didn't return any matches, maybe the term isn't used in the documents, but the settlement date might still be present in other forms.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract settlement dates like execution dates, court approval dates, etc. The Docket has dates like 7/21/2025, 7/28/2025, etc., but those are for motions and orders, not settlement. The Docket mentions an Order granting TRO on 7/28/2025, but that's a temporary restraining order, not a settlement. The documents listed as unvisited might contain the settlement terms.\n\nThe user needs to find the settlement date. Since the Docket was read and no settlement dates were found, the next step is to read one of the unvisited documents. The most likely candidates are the Order/Opinion documents (Revised Temporary Restraining Order, etc.) because they might contain settlement details. The Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is mentioned multiple times, but the TRO is a court order, not a settlement. However, sometimes settlement agreements are part of the orders.\n\nWait, the checklist says not to include dates once the settlement is incorporated into a judgment or order. But if there's a settlement agreement, maybe it's in the motion documents. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction\" might have settlement terms, but the name suggests it's a motion for preliminary injunction, not settlement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the settlement date is in the \"Joint STIPULATION\" (document 39 in Docket: \"Joint STIPULATION filed by All Plaintiffs. (Cahill, Nina) (Entered: 08/08/2025)\"). A stipulation could be part of a settlement. But the Docket entry for 39 says it's a Joint STIPULATION, which might include settlement terms. However, the Docket was fully read, so the text of the stipulation isn't in the Docket's tokens. Wait, the Docket is the log of entries, not the actual documents. So the actual stipulation document is a separate document (not the Docket), which is listed as \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" but maybe the stipulation is in another document. Wait, the available documents include \"Complaint\", \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", etc. The Docket is a separate document that lists all filings, but the actual documents (like the stipulation) are the other files.\n\nSo the Docket was read, but the actual stipulation is in another document. The \"Joint STIPULATION\" is listed in the Docket as entry 39, but the actual document is probably one of the unvisited files. The \"Joint STIPULATION\" might be part of the \"Complaint\" document or another. Wait, the document names: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is a document, and \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is another. The Joint STIPULATION is a separate filing, so it's likely in one of the unvisited documents.\n\nGiven that, the next step should be to read one of the unvisited documents. The most promising ones are the Order/Opinion documents (Revised, Second Revised, Temporary Restraining Order) because they might have the settlement terms. Alternatively, the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief...\" might have settlement language.\n\nBut the search for \"settlement\" didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't used, but the date is present. So the assistant needs to read a document to check for dates related to settlement.\n\nThe correct action is to use read_document on one of the unvisited documents. Since the Docket was already read and no settlement dates found, the next logical step is to read the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" (Order/Opinion) document, as it's a court order that might mention settlement dates. The document is 1,959 tokens, which is under 10k, so it's safe to read.\n\nWait, the document names: \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] - 1,959 tokens. So the assistant should call read_document on that document, starting from 0 to 1959 tokens (since it's unvisited).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1959}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1959}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11064, "completion_tokens": 1131, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement date from legal documents, specifically the \"Date_of_Settlement\" checklist item. \n\nFirst, I'll review the current status. The snapshot shows that the \"Date_of_Settlement\" key is empty, and all documents have been checked except for three: Complaint, Second Revised TRO, and the two motions. The Docket and Revised Temporary Restraining Order (which was fully read) don't mention settlement dates. The search for \"settlement\" returned zero matches, so I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking at the Revised TRO document (which was read), the key part is the order date. The document says \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" That's the date the order was issued. The checklist requires extracting settlement dates, but this is a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order), not a settlement. The user's checklist definition says to exclude dates once the settlement is incorporated into a judgment. Since this is a TRO, not a settlement, this date shouldn't count. But wait—maybe the TRO is part of the settlement process? The checklist mentions \"enforcement/retention dates without incorporation,\" but TROs are interim orders, not settlements. \n\nThe user's checklist specifically says: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" The Revised TRO is an order, but it's a TRO, not a settlement. However, the TRO is a temporary measure, not a final settlement. So the date here (August 7, 2025) isn't a settlement date. The checklist items include \"execution/signing date(s),\" but this is a court order date, not a settlement agreement date. \n\nThe next step is to check if any other documents mention settlement. The \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is unvisited (○ Unvisited), and it's a different document. The filename suggests it's a revised TRO, so it might have a date. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" and other motions might reference settlement dates, but the search for \"settlement\" didn't find anything. \n\nWait, the user's checklist definition says to extract dates like \"execution/signing date(s)\" of the settlement agreement. The current documents (Docket, Revised TRO) don't show a settlement agreement. The Docket has a TRO order (Aug 7, 2025), but that's not a settlement. The settlement date would be when the parties signed a settlement agreement, not when the court issued an order. Since the search for \"settlement\" found nothing, and the TRO isn't a settlement, it's possible there is no settlement date in the documents. \n\nBut the checklist requires marking \"Not Applicable\" only if there's explicit evidence. The absence of any mention of settlement in the documents might mean it's Not Applicable. However, the policy says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So I can't assume it's Not Applicable yet. \n\nThe next document to check is the \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" (unvisited, 1996 tokens). It might have a date. Since the Revised TRO was dated Aug 7, 2025, the Second Revised might have a different date. But the Docket entry for it (entry 37) says \"SECOND REVISED ORDER ... So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/7/2025.\" Wait, entry 37 in the Docket says \"SECOND REVISED ORDER ... on 8/7/2025.\" So the date is August 7, 2025. But again, that's a court order, not a settlement. \n\nThe checklist item is \"Date_of_Settlement,\" so unless the documents explicitly state that a settlement was reached and date it, this isn't applicable. The Docket has entries about TROs, motions, and orders, but no settlement. The Complaint (unvisited) might mention settlement, but the user's search for \"settlement\" in all documents found zero matches, so it's unlikely. \n\nWait, the search was done with \"settlement\" as the pattern, but maybe it's spelled out in another way. The checklist definition says \"settlement agreement,\" so the word \"settlement\" should be there. Since the regex search found nothing, it's probably not present. \n\nGiven that all visited documents (Docket and Revised TRO) don't contain a settlement date, and the unvisited documents haven't been checked yet, the next logical step is to read the \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" to see if it contains the term \"settlement\" or a settlement date. But the Docket entry for it already says \"SECOND REVISED ORDER\" on 8/7/2025, so it's an order, not a settlement. \n\nWait, the user's task is to extract the settlement date. If the documents don't contain a settlement agreement, then the key should be marked Not Applicable. But according to the policy, I can't do that without evidence. The only evidence would be if the documents state that there's no settlement, like \"no settlement reached\" or \"case proceeding to trial.\" \n\nLooking at the Docket, the last entry is a Notice of Hearing for the Preliminary Injunction on 9/4/2025. There's no mention of settlement. The TROs are ongoing, and the case is still active. So there's no settlement yet. The checklist item \"Date_of_Settlement\" would be Not Applicable because the settlement hasn't occurred. But the policy requires explicit evidence. \n\nThe Docket entry 37 says \"SECOND REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order.\" The case is still ongoing, as per the hearing scheduled for 9/4/2025. So there's no settlement date to extract. The correct action is to set \"Date_of_Settlement\" to Not Applicable with evidence. \n\nBut how to get that evidence? The Docket shows no settlement mentioned, and the case is active. The \"Not Applicable\" evidence should be something like \"case is ongoing with no settlement reached.\" The Docket entries don't say that, but the fact that there's a hearing for a Preliminary Injunction scheduled (entry 27: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction... Hearing set for 9/4/2025\") implies the case is still in progress and no settlement has been made. \n\nSo the evidence for Not Applicable is the ongoing case status. The checklist requires a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. \n\nTherefore, the next action should be to use `update_checklist` to set Date_of_Settlement to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Docket (entry 27 or others showing the case is ongoing). \n\nWait, but the current state shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for Date_of_Settlement. Since we've checked all documents (Docket and Revised TRO) and found no settlement date, and the case is ongoing (as per the Docket), it's safe to mark it as Not Applicable. \n\nThe Docket entry 27: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025...\" shows the case is proceeding to trial, so no settlement. \n\nSo the evidence can be the Docket entry about the upcoming hearing. \n\nTherefore, the correct action is `update_checklist` with the key Date_of_Settlement and value \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the Docket (entry 27, which is part of the Docket document, fully visited).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Date_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R.

The user needs to extract the settlement date from legal documents, but the current status shows that Date_of_Settlement is marked as \"Not Applicable\" based on the Docket entry mentioning a hearing on 9/4/2025. Wait, but the instructions say to mark it as Not Applicable only if there's explicit evidence that the settlement isn't incorporated into a judgment or order. \n\nLooking at the documents processed so far: the Docket shows a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) with dates like 7/24/2025 (hearing) and 8/7/2025 (order), but no settlement. The Revised TRO Order (Document 34) is dated 8/7/2025, and it's a TRO, not a settlement. The checklist definition says not to include dates once settlement is incorporated into a judgment. Since there's no settlement mentioned anywhere in the documents read (Docket and Revised TRO), and the hearing is for a preliminary injunction (not settlement), it's correct that Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable.\n\nBut wait, the user's task is to extract settlement dates, and the current extraction says it's Not Applicable. However, I need to confirm if any other documents might contain settlement info. The available documents include \"Complaint\", \"Second Revised TRO\", \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Pleading for Preliminary Injunction\", etc. None of these have settlement dates mentioned. The TROs are about restraining orders, not settlements. The motion for preliminary injunction is still pending (hearing on 9/4/2025), so no settlement yet.\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" Since there's no settlement order here, and the case is ongoing, the absence of a settlement date means it's Not Applicable. The evidence from the Docket (hearing date for PI) supports that there's no settlement yet, so it's correctly marked as Not Applicable.\n\nNow, checking the current state: all keys (only Date_of_Settlement) are either filled or Not Applicable. The checklist summary shows 1 key with Not Applicable. The available documents are unvisited, but they're all related to motions and orders that don't mention settlement. For example, the Complaint (unvisited) is the initial filing, which wouldn't have a settlement date. The other unvisited documents are orders or motions that are part of the TRO process, not settlement.\n\nSince the checklist has only one item and it's correctly marked as Not Applicable, the next step should be to stop. The user's instructions say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. There are no other checklist items to extract here. The previous step already did an update_checklist setting it to Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket (the hearing date for PI, which implies no settlement yet).\n\nWait, the evidence given was from Docket Entry 27: \"NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction... Hearing set for 9/4/2025\". The reasoning for Not Applicable is that there's no settlement mentioned, and the case is still pending with a PI hearing. So that's valid evidence. No need to read more documents because the checklist item is already handled.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop. The decision should be \"stop\" with the reason that the checklist item is correctly marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence, and no further documents can provide a settlement date (as the case is ongoing).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Date_of_Settlement) are correctly marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence from Docket Entry 27 (hearing date for Preliminary Injunction), confirming no settlement exists in the corpus.

The user is asking to extract the settlement date from legal documents. The checklist item is Date_of_Settlement, which requires all settlement-related dates. But from the prior steps, they've already marked it as \"Not Applicable\" based on evidence from the Docket Entry 27 mentioning a hearing date for a Preliminary Injunction, implying no settlement exists.\n\nLooking at the current status: the system says all keys are filled (1/1), and the only key (Date_of_Settlement) is marked as Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket. The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Second Revised TRO, etc. But the prior step 5 used update_checklist to set it to Not Applicable, and step 6 tried to stop. However, the system automatically ran get_checklist after the first stop attempt.\n\nThe user's current task is to confirm if all items are correctly marked. The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, with the key as Not Applicable. The evidence cited is from Docket Entry 27, which mentions a hearing date but no settlement. The prior actions (steps 1-7) indicate that after searching all documents for \"settlement\" and finding no matches, they concluded it's Not Applicable.\n\nNow, the available documents have some unvisited, but the instructions say not to reread fully visited documents. The Docket and Revised TRO are fully visited. The other documents (Complaint, etc.) are unvisited, but the regex search in step 3 found 0 matches for \"settlement\". Since the regex search across all documents returned nothing, and the Docket evidence confirms no settlement (only a hearing date), it's unlikely the unvisited documents contain settlement dates.\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding requires explicit evidence. The Docket Entry 27's notice of hearing for a Preliminary Injunction (not a settlement) supports that there's no settlement. So the current state seems correct.\n\nThe system's automatic review says \"Checklist Status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty\", so all keys are properly marked. The stop criteria are met because the key is Not Applicable with evidence. The user is now at the second stop attempt (stop attempt 1/2), so they need to stop again.\n\nNo further document reading is needed because the regex search already covered all documents and found nothing. The unvisited documents might not have relevant info, but the prior search was exhaustive. The evidence from Docket Entry 27 is sufficient for Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop with the reason that the Date_of_Settlement is correctly marked as Not Applicable based on the Docket evidence, and no further extraction is possible or necessary.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Date_of_Settlement) are correctly marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence from Docket Entry 27 (hearing date for Preliminary Injunction), confirming no settlement exists in the corpus.
