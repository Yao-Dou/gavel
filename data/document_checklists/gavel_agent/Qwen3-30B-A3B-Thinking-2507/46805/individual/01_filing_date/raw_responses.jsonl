The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data.

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty, and there are 7 unvisited documents. The first step after listing documents is to read a document that likely contains the filing date. The Complaint is probably the most likely place to find the initial filing date since it's the first document filed in the case. The Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is a safer bet.\n\nThe Complaint has 43k tokens, which is a lot, but I can't read the whole thing at once. The system says to read a targeted window of up to 10k tokens. So I should start by reading the beginning of the Complaint where the filing date would typically be mentioned. Usually, the filing date is on the first page, maybe in the header or the caption.\n\nI need to call read_document for the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That's the first 10k tokens. That should cover the initial part of the document where the date would be. Once I get that text, I can look for the date and then append it to the checklist.\n\nI shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because the pattern for a date might be too vague. The date format might vary (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY), but it's better to read the document first to confirm where it's located. The Complaint is the most relevant document here, so reading it makes sense.\n\nSo the next action is to read the first 10k tokens of the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3330, "completion_tokens": 401, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The text they read shows \"Filed 07/21/25\" on the first page. So the filing date is 07/21/25.\n\nWait, the task is to extract every distinct value. Since this is the only document read so far, and the date is clearly stated, that's the value. The evidence needs to be the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location here is \"Page 1\" as per the document header.\n\nThe checklist item Filing_Date is empty right now, so I should append this value. The evidence should include \"Filed 07/21/25\" as the text, the document name \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and location \"Page 1\".\n\nI need to use `append_checklist` because this is adding a new entry. The value is \"07/21/25\", and the evidence has the required fields. Since there's only one value, I'll structure the patch accordingly.\n\nWait, the date format is 07/21/25, which is July 21, 2025. But the problem says to extract the exact value as written, so it's okay. The evidence needs the verbatim text, which is \"Filed 07/21/25\" from the document header.\n\nSo the next action should be `append_checklist` with the key Filing_Date and the extracted value. Let me make sure all evidence fields are present: text, source_document, location.

The evidence is solid - it's explicitly stated as \"Filed 07/21/25\" in the document header.\n\nI should verify if there could be other filing dates in other documents. But the checklist definition says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed\" - that's a single event.

In legal documents, this is typically only stated once in the complaint (which is the first document filed). The other documents (docket, orders, motions) are subsequent filings, so their dates wouldn't be the initial filing date.\n\nChecking the document catalog:\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (the first document) shows \"Filed 07/21/25\" on page 1\n- All other documents are marked as unvisited (○ Unvisited), but they're not the complaint document\n\nThe task definition specifically says: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" This means only the initial complaint's filing date matters.

The requirement says \"extract EVERY distinct value\" - but since it's the same date, it's not distinct.\n\nThe evidence shows \"Filed 07/21/25\" clearly on the complaint. There's no indication of a different date elsewhere. The other documents are all motions and orders that would be filed after the initial complaint.\n\nThe system has already confirmed this is the only value needed.
