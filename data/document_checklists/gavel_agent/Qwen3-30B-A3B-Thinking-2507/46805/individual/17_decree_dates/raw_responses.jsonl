The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and it's currently empty. The available documents are all unvisited, so I need to start reading them.\n\nFirst, I should check which document is most likely to contain decree dates. The documents listed include Complaint, Docket, Temporary Restraining Orders (multiple versions), and Motions. Decree dates are typically in court orders or opinions, so the \"Order/Opinion\" documents might be the best place to look. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised, and Temporary Restraining Order are all under Order/Opinion. The Docket might have dates too, but court orders are more likely to have the specific decree dates mentioned.\n\nSince the user mentioned \"entry dates\" and \"modification dates\", the actual orders would have those. The Docket might list dates but not necessarily the decree details. So I should prioritize reading the Order/Opinion documents first.\n\nThe user has 7 documents, all unvisited. The first step is to read a document. The largest token count is the Complaint at 43k, but that's probably the initial filing, not the decree. The Order/Opinion documents are smaller: 1,959, 1,996, 1,909 tokens. These are manageable. Let's pick the first Order/Opinion document: \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] with 1,959 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the whole thing (start_token 0, end_token 1959) to check for any decree dates.\n\nWait, the token count is 1,959, so reading from 0 to 1959 should cover the whole document. That's under 10k tokens, so it's allowed. Using read_document is the right choice here. I shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because I don't have a specific pattern. The user's requirement says to extract dates formatted as [date]: [decree event], so maybe looking for dates in the text, but first, better to read the document to see if there are any dates mentioned.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" from 0 to 1959.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1959}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1959}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3446, "completion_tokens": 539, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and they need every distinct date with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, the only document that's been read so far is the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" (tokens 0-1959), which is fully visited. The user provided the text from that document. I need to check if there's any decree date mentioned there.\n\nScanning through the document, the key dates mentioned are the filing date: \"Filed 08/07/25\" on the document header. Also, the order is dated \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" So that's August 7, 2025. The document says \"Filed 08/07/25\" which is the same date as the order date. \n\nWait, the requirement says to extract decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification dates, etc. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order is a TRO, which is a type of injunction, so the entry date should be included. The document's order date is August 7, 2025, and the filing date is the same. The TRO is the decree here, so the date is 08/07/2025.\n\nThe user's checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", so this date should be extracted. The format needs to be '[date]: [decree event]'. The decree event here is \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\" or similar. The document says \"SO ORDERED. Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" So the event is the entry of the order.\n\nSo the value would be \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\". The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location here is the document header and the signature line. The tokens read are 0-1959, which covers the entire document. The text snippet would be \"Filed 08/07/25\" and \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\"\n\nWait, the document says \"Filed 08/07/25\" and \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" So both the filing date and the order date are the same. The decree (the order) was entered on that date, so the date to extract is 08/07/2025 with the event as the order being entered.\n\nNow, the next step is to append this to the checklist. The current checklist for Dates_of_All_Decrees is empty. So I need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The evidence needs to have the text, source document, and location. The source document is \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", location can be \"Page 5\" or \"signature line\" since the date is at the end.\n\nLooking at the document text, the \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" is on Page 5 (as per the page numbers in the document header: Page 5 of 5 PageID #957). So location is \"Page 5\".\n\nThe verbatim text for evidence would be \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" and \"Filed 08/07/25\" but the key date is the order date, so the main evidence is the dated signature.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\". The evidence text would be \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" from the document.\n\nWait, the requirement says to format each date as '[date]: [decree event]'. So the date should be in a standard format. The document uses \"08/07/25\" and \"August 7, 2025\". The user probably expects the full date. But the example in the checklist says \"formatted as: [date]: [decree event]\". The date should be in a consistent format. The document's date is written as \"August 7, 2025\", so maybe convert that to \"08/07/2025\" for consistency.\n\nSo the value would be \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\".\n\nNow, check if there are other dates in the document. The hearing was on July 24, 2025, but that's not a decree date. The TRO was granted on August 7, 2025, so that's the decree date. The hearing date isn't the decree date, so it shouldn't be included.\n\nSo only one date found so far. The next action is to append this to the checklist. The user's current step is to extract all decree dates, and this is the first one.\n\nThe available documents include others, but since this document is fully visited and we've found a date, we should append it now. The next step after reading a document is to use append_checklist with the extracted value.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with the key \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and the extracted entry containing the value and evidence.\n\nCheck the parameters for append_checklist: it requires a patch array with key and extracted (array of entries). Each entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo the evidence should have text, source_document, location. For this, text is \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\", source_document is \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", location is \"Page 5\".\n\nWait, the document's page number is listed as \"Page 5 of 5\", so location can be \"Page 5\".\n\nSo the evidence object would be:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\",\n  \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\",\n  \"location\": \"Page 5\"\n}\n\nThen the value is \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\".\n\nWait, but the requirement says \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: [date]: [decree event]\". So the value is the string \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\", not the date and event separately.\n\nSo the extracted value is that full string.\n\nNow, confirm that this is the correct date. The document is a Revised Temporary Restraining Order, which is a type of decree (injunction), so the entry date should be included. The order was entered on August 7, 2025, so yes.\n\nNo other dates in the document for decrees. The hearing date (July 24) is not a decree date. The filing date (08/07/25) matches the order date, so that's the same as the decree date.\n\nTherefore, the correct value to append is \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\" with the evidence as above.\n\nSo the next action is to call append_checklist with this entry.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\", \"source_document\": \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"location\": \"Page 5\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Dates_of_All_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered", "evidence": [{"text": "Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.", "source_document": "Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "Page 5"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5590, "completion_tokens": 1671, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and so far, they've found one entry from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order dated 08/07/2025.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have 1 out of 1 keys filled. But wait, the checklist says to extract every distinct value, including entry dates, modification dates, etc. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order is a TRO, not a decree. The example in the checklist mentions \"injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions.\" A TRO is a temporary order, not a final decree. So maybe the date they extracted isn't actually a decree date.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 says they appended \"08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered\" as a decree date. But the document is labeled as a \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order,\" which is not a decree. The actual decree might be the final order after the preliminary injunction. The checklist specifies that the Revised Temporary Restraining Order's entry date shouldn't be included because it's a TRO, not a final decree. The example says \"pre-entry settlement dates do not belong here,\" but here it's a TRO, not a settlement. So the date they extracted might be incorrect.\n\nThe current documents include a \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" and a \"Temporary Restraining Order.\" There's also a \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction\" and the Complaint. The final decree might be in a different document. The checklist requires decree dates, so the TRO dates shouldn't be counted. The user's current extraction might be wrong, so they need to check other documents for actual decrees.\n\nThe available documents include the Second Revised TRO, which might have a different date. Also, the Docket might list the entry of a final decree. The Docket document is unvisited, so it's a candidate. The Docket usually lists all court entries, including when a decree was entered.\n\nThe next step should be to check the Docket document for any decree entries. The Docket is 7,409 tokens, which is manageable. Since the current extraction might be incorrect (TRO vs. decree), they need to verify if there's a final decree in other documents. The Docket is the best place to look for entry dates of orders.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" might have a date, but again, it's a TRO. The actual decree might be in a different document, like a \"Final Judgment\" or \"Consent Decree,\" but the documents listed don't have those names. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might mention a date when the decree is entered, but the motion itself is a request, not the decree.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions.\" The Revised TRO is a temporary order, not a final decree. So the date they extracted is likely incorrect. Therefore, they need to look for actual decree dates in other documents. The Docket is the most likely place to find the entry date of the final decree. The Docket will list all docket entries, including when the court entered a final order.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document to find any decree dates. The Docket is unvisited, so they should call read_document on the Docket. Since it's a docket, the entry dates might be in the header or in the entries. The Docket's token count is 7,409, so reading the whole document is possible since it's under 10k tokens. But to be efficient, maybe start from the beginning. However, the system says not to reread fully visited docs, but this one is unvisited. So read_document on Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 7409.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was append_checklist for Dates_of_All_Decrees with the TRO date, but that might be a mistake. The correct approach is to check if there's a decree date elsewhere. Since the current extracted value might be invalid, the next step is to verify by checking other documents. The Docket is the best candidate to find the decree entry date.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The function call would be read_document for \"Docket\" from 0 to 7409 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5703, "completion_tokens": 1012, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents, specifically for the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\". From the current status, they've already extracted one date from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (08/07/2025) and appended it.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, the Docket and Revised Temporary Restraining Order are fully visited. The other documents (Complaint, Second Revised TRO, Temporary Restraining Order, Motions) are unvisited. The next logical step is to check if any of these unvisited documents contain additional decree dates.\n\nThe checklist requires all decree-related dates, including entry dates, amendments, etc. The Revised TRO was amended multiple times (Document 34, 37, 47), so the Docket shows dates like 08/07/2025 and 08/20/2025 for the orders. Wait, in the Docket, Document 34 is dated 08/07/2025, Document 37 is 08/07/2025, and Document 47 is 08/20/2025. The user's current extraction only has 08/07/2025. But Document 47 (Third Revised Order) is dated 08/20/2025, which should be another decree date.\n\nWait, the user's current extracted value is from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Document 34), which is dated 08/07/2025. But Document 47 is the Third Revised Order, dated 08/20/2025. So that's another entry. The Docket entry for 47 says \"Third Revised Order granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\"\n\nSo the user needs to extract 08/20/2025 as a separate value. But the Docket is already fully visited (tokens 0-7409), so they can't read it again. Wait, the Docket is marked as fully visited. The user already read the Docket in Step 4, so they have the text. But in the Docket, they have the entry for Document 47 with the date 08/20/2025. So why wasn't that extracted yet?\n\nWait, in the recent actions, Step 4 was reading the Docket (tokens 0-7409), and the Docket text shows Document 47 with \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\" So the user should have found that date when reading the Docket. But the current status shows only 1 value extracted. So maybe they missed it in their initial extraction.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 was appending Dates_of_All_Decrees with the 08/07/2025 date from the Revised TRO. Then Step 4 was reading the Docket, which includes the 08/20/2025 date. But they haven't appended that yet. So the next action should be to append the 08/20/2025 date from the Docket.\n\nBut the Docket is fully visited, so they can't read it again. However, they already read it in Step 4. The text from the Docket includes the 08/20/2025 date in Document 47. So the user should have extracted that when they read the Docket. But in the current status, only 1 value is extracted. That means they need to append the second value from the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for Document 47 is \"47 | 2025-08-20 | THIRD REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\" So the date is 08/20/2025, and the event is \"Third Revised Order granted\".\n\nSo the user should append this as another entry for Dates_of_All_Decrees. The evidence would be from the Docket, location 47, with the text \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to use append_checklist to add this second value. Since they've already read the Docket, they can now append the new value.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 4 was reading the Docket, and then they need to append the values found. But in the current status, they haven't done that yet. So the correct next action is append_checklist with the new date.\n\nCheck the checklist definition: \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event].'\" So 08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted.\n\nThe evidence should include the verbatim text from the Docket entry for Document 47. The Docket entry has \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\" So the text is \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\"\n\nThe source document is \"Docket\", location is \"Document 47\" (or the specific entry in the Docket).\n\nSo the append_checklist should have:\n- key: Dates_of_All_Decrees\n- extracted: [ { value: \"08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted\", evidence: [ { text: \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/20/2025.\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"Document 47\" } ] } ]\n\nWait, but the user's current extracted value is 08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered. The new one is 08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist to add the second entry.\n\nThe user's current status shows 1 value extracted, but they have another one in the Docket.

The user is working on extracting decree dates from legal documents. They've already processed two documents: the Revised Temporary Restraining Order and the Docket. They found two dates: 08/07/2025 from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order and 08/20/2025 from the Docket.\n\nLooking at the current status, the checklist item Dates_of_All_Decrees has two values. The available documents include several unvisited ones: Complaint, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, and Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO. \n\nThe user needs to check if any of these unvisited documents contain additional decree dates. The next step is to read a document that might have more relevant dates. The Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order is a candidate since it's a revised order, which might have a new date. The Temporary Restraining Order might also have an original date. \n\nWait, the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (which was read) had the 08/07/2025 date. The Docket had 08/20/2025 from Document 47 (Third Revised Order). The Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order might have another date. Let me check the document names. The Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order is listed as a document, so reading that could reveal another decree date. \n\nThe user should read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order. Since it's unvisited (○ Unvisited), they need to use read_document. The token count is 1,996, which is under 10k, so it's safe. The start and end tokens should be 0-1996. \n\nWait, the previous reads were for the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (0-1959) and the Docket (0-7409). The Second Revised document hasn't been read yet. So the next action should be to read that document. \n\nCheck if the checklist item might have more values. The current extraction has two dates. The Second Revised Order might have a date, like the one in the Docket for Document 37 (Second Revised Order) which was dated 08/07/2025. Wait, in the Docket, Document 37 says \"Second REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION... So Ordered by District Judge... on 8/7/2025.\" So that's another date. But the Docket entry for 37 was already read as part of the Docket document. Wait, the Docket document was read in Step 4, and they extracted the 08/20/2025 from Document 47. But Document 37 (Second Revised Order) in the Docket was dated 08/07/2025. However, the Docket entry for 37 says \"So Ordered by District Judge... on 8/7/2025.\" So that's another date. Wait, but the user's Step 5 append_checklist only added the 08/20/2025 from Document 47. Did they miss the 08/07/2025 from Document 37?\n\nWait, in the Docket text provided in Step 4, Document 37 is listed as \"37 | 2025-08-07 | SECOND REVISED ORDER... So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/7/2025.\" So the date 08/07/2025 is already present in the Docket. But in Step 5, the user extracted 08/20/2025 from Document 47. However, the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Step 2) had 08/07/2025. So the Docket's Document 37 also has 08/07/2025. But the user might have already captured that date from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, so the Docket's Document 37 is the same date. So maybe the two entries are duplicates. Wait, the Revised Temporary Restraining Order was dated 08/07/2025, and the Second Revised Order (Document 37) is also dated 08/07/2025. So that's the same date. So the user has two entries: one from the order itself (08/07/2025) and one from the Docket's Document 37 (same date). But the user's Step 3 extracted 08/07/2025 from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order, and Step 5 extracted 08/20/2025 from Document 47. So they have two distinct dates. \n\nBut the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order document might have a different date. Wait, the document name is \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", so perhaps it's a different version with a new date. The Docket shows Document 37 as the Second Revised Order dated 08/07/2025, and Document 34 as the Revised Temporary Restraining Order dated 08/07/2025. Wait, Document 34 was the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Step 2), which was dated 08/07/2025. Document 37 is the Second Revised Order, also dated 08/07/2025. So the actual date is the same. But the user's extracted values are two different entries: one from the order itself (08/07/2025) and one from the Docket's Document 47 (08/20/2025). Wait, Document 47 is the Third Revised Order, dated 08/20/2025. So that's a new date. So the two dates are 08/07/2025 (from Revised Order) and 08/20/2025 (from Third Revised Order). \n\nNow, the other documents: Temporary Restraining Order (original) might have a date. The Docket shows Document 23 as the Order granting the TRO on 07/28/2025. Wait, in the Docket, Document 23 says \"ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/2025.\" So that's another date. But the user hasn't extracted that yet. So the Temporary Restraining Order document (Document 23) might have the date 07/28/2025. But the user read the Docket, which already includes that date. Wait, in the Docket text, Document 23 is listed with the date 07/28/2025. So when they read the Docket in Step 4, they should have seen that. But in Step 5, they only extracted the 08/20/2025 from Document 47. So perhaps they missed Document 23's date. Wait, the Docket entry for Document 23 is: \"23 | 2025-07-28 | ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/2025.\" So the date 07/28/2025 should be extracted. But in the Step 5 summary, they only mention appending 08/20/2025. So maybe they missed the 07/28/2025 date from the Docket. \n\nWait, the user's Step 5 says: \"Extracted Values: • Dates_of_All_Decrees: → Value 1: '08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted'\". But the Docket also has Document 23 with 07/28/2025. So why wasn't that extracted? Maybe because when they read the Docket, they focused on Document 47. But the Docket is a single document, so when they read the Docket (tokens 0-7409), they should have seen all entries. So the 07/28/2025 date should have been extracted. But in the Step 5 summary, they only list one new value. Hmm. Maybe the user missed it in their extraction. But according to the instructions, after reading a document, they should extract all applicable values. So perhaps they need to check the Docket again for other dates. However, the Docket is marked as Fully Visited (✓ Fully Visited), so they can't re-read it. \n\nWait, the Docket is marked as Fully Visited (Viewed tokens 0-7409), so they can't read it again. So they have to rely on the previous extraction. But in their Step 5, they only appended the 08/20/2025 date. So maybe they missed the 07/28/2025 date. But according to the problem statement, the user's recent actions show that they appended 08/20/2025. So perhaps they didn't extract the 07/28/2025. However, the problem states that the user's Step 5 successfully appended one key with that value. So maybe they only extracted the latest date. But the checklist requires every distinct value. So the 07/28/2025 should be another value. \n\nBut since the Docket is fully visited, they can't go back. So they need to check other documents. Wait, the Temporary Restraining Order document might have the 07/28/2025 date. The document name is \"Temporary Restraining Order\" (1,909 tokens, unvisited). So reading that document might confirm the date. But the Docket already has it, so maybe it's redundant. However, the user's extraction from the Docket might have missed it, so they should verify via the document itself. \n\nBut the user's current task is to extract all distinct values. The Docket entry for Document 23 says the order was granted on 07/28/2025. So that's a decree date. The user should have extracted it. But since they didn't, maybe they need to use get_checklist to see what's already extracted. Wait, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", which would be 08/07/2025 (from Revised Order) and 08/20/2025 (from Docket Document 47). But the 07/28/2025 is missing. So they need to check if that's in the extracted values. \n\nWait, the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Step 2) had the date 08/07/2025 (the order was entered on that date). The Temporary Restraining Order (Document 23) was granted on 07/28/2025. So that's another decree date. The user should have extracted that from the Docket, but maybe they missed it. Since the Docket is fully read, they can't re-read, but perhaps they can use get_checklist to check the current state. \n\nWait, the user's current step is to choose the next action. The available documents include the Temporary Restraining Order (unvisited). So the next logical step is to read that document to see if it contains a decree date, like 07/28/2025. But the Docket already mentions it, so the date might be in the document. However, the user should confirm by reading the document. \n\nAlternatively, the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order might have a date. The Docket shows Document 37 as Second Revised Order dated 08/07/2025, which is the same as the Revised Order. So perhaps the document itself has the date. \n\nBut the user's current checklist has two values. They need to check if there's a third. The Temporary Restraining Order (original) might have the 07/28/2025 date. So the next action should be to read the Temporary Restraining Order document. \n\nThe document is named \"Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] with 1,909 tokens, unvisited. So the next action is to read that document from tokens 0-1909. \n\nWait, but the user should check if the document is likely to contain the date. The name suggests it's the original TRO, which was granted on 07/28/2025 (per Docket Document 23). So reading it would confirm the date. \n\nThus, the correct next action is to call read_document on \"Temporary Restraining Order\" with start_token 0 and end_token 1909.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1909}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1909}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13420, "completion_tokens": 2882, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. So far, they've already extracted two dates: one from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (08/07/2025) and another from the Docket (08/20/2025). The current status shows two values for Dates_of_All_Decrees.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are three unvisited ones: Complaint, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief, and Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO. Wait, the document list shows \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" as unvisited, which might contain another decree date. The Revised Temporary Restraining Order (Step 2) was read, but the Second Revised might have a different date.\n\nWait, in Step 6, they read the Temporary Restraining Order (Document 23, filed 07/28/25), which has a date of July 28, 2025. But the checklist says to extract decree dates, including entry dates. The Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is a type of decree, so the date in that document (07/28/2025) should be added. However, in the prior steps, they only appended two dates. Wait, in Step 3, they added 08/07/2025 from the Revised TRO, and Step 5 added 08/20/2025 from the Docket (Document 47). The Temporary Restraining Order (Document 23) has a date of 07/28/2025, which hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nWait, the user's recent action (Step 6) was reading the Temporary Restraining Order (tokens 0-1909), which includes \"Dated this 28th day of July, 2025.\" So that's another decree date. But in the extraction progress, they only have two values. So they need to append this third date.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\" but they just read the Temporary Restraining Order, which has a date. So the next step should be to append that date. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and each decree date should be a separate entry.\n\nSo the evidence for 07/28/2025 would be from the Temporary Restraining Order document, page 5: \"Dated this 28th day of July, 2025.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to append this new value. The tool to use is append_checklist. The previous steps used append_checklist for the two existing values, so this should be the third entry.\n\nCheck if the document is fully visited: the Temporary Restraining Order is marked as ✓ Fully Visited (Viewed tokens 0-1909), so it's okay to append based on that.

The user is asking to extract decree dates from legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and they've already extracted three values from previous steps.\n\nLooking at the current status: they have three values already. The documents that are fully visited are Docket, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, and Temporary Restraining Order. The other documents like Complaint, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion, etc., are unvisited.\n\nWait, the checklist requires all decree-related dates, including entry dates, modifications, etc. The existing values are:\n- 08/07/2025: Revised Temporary Restraining Order entered (from Revised TRO doc)\n- 08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted (from Docket, Document 47)\n- 07/28/2025: Temporary Restraining Order entered (from TRO doc)\n\nBut the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order document is still unvisited. The name suggests it's another decree, so it probably has a date. The document name is \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] - 1,996 tokens, unvisited. The previous Revised TRO was on 08/07/2025 (Document 34), and the Third Revised on 08/20/2025 (Document 47). So the Second Revised would likely have a date too.\n\nThe user needs to read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order to check for its entry date. Since it's unvisited, they should use read_document on that file. The document is under 10k tokens, so it's safe. The next logical step is to read that document to see if there's another decree date.\n\nWait, the existing values include the Third Revised Order (08/20), but the Second Revised might have a date. The Docket entry 37 mentions \"SECOND REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION...\" on 8/7/2025, but the actual document might have the date. The document name is \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order,\" so it's likely dated around 08/07/2025. But the evidence should come from the document itself, not the Docket. The Docket says \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 8/7/2025\" for Document 34 (which is the Second Revised Order). But the user needs to confirm the exact date in the document.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order document to extract its date. Since it's unvisited, call read_document on that file with tokens 0-1996. That's within the 10k limit. No need for regex since the document name suggests it's the one with the date. The other unvisited documents (Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction) are less likely to contain decree dates, as they're motions or complaints, not orders. The Complaint might have a filing date, but that's not a decree date. So the priority is the Second Revised TRO document.\n\nCheck if any other documents might have decree dates. The Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO was filed on 07/21, but the decree dates are the court orders. The Third Revised Order is already covered. So the Second Revised is the next one to check. Therefore, read_document on \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" from tokens 0-1996.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1996}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1996}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13542, "completion_tokens": 799, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and we need to find every distinct date related to decrees, including entry dates, amendments, etc.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted three values. From the Docket (step 5), there's \"08/20/2025: Third Revised Order granted\". From the Temporary Restraining Order (step 7), \"07/28/2025: Temporary Restraining Order entered\". And from the Revised Temporary Restraining Order (step 8), \"08/07/2025: Second Revised Order granted\" (since the document says \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025\").\n\nWait, the user's step 8 was reading the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, which has the date August 7, 2025. But in the extraction steps, step 7 was the Temporary Restraining Order (July 28), and step 8 was the Second Revised (August 7). The current status says they have three values, but maybe they missed the August 7 date in the previous append_checklist. Wait, no—the step 8 read the document, but they haven't appended it yet. Let me check.\n\nIn step 8, they read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, which has the date \"Dated this 7th day of August, 2025.\" So they need to append that date. The current extracted values are 3, but maybe they only have two from steps 5 and 7, and step 8's read hasn't been processed yet. Wait, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", so perhaps they already appended the August 7 date. Wait, no—the step 8 action is a read_document, and the next step would be to append the new value. But the user's current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", which probably includes the three dates: July 28, August 7, and August 20.\n\nWait, let's confirm. The Docket entry (step 5) was 8/20/2025. The Temporary Restraining Order (step 7) was 7/28/2025. The Second Revised (step 8) is 8/7/2025. So three dates. So the current status shows 3 values. But the user's step 8 is a read_document, and the next action should be to append the new value from that document.\n\nWait, looking at the recent actions: step 8 was read_document on Second Revised TRO (tokens 0-1996). The document has the date August 7, 2025. So they need to append that date. The current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", but maybe that's after appending. Wait, the problem says \"Step 8. read_document...\" followed by the document text. Then, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", which would mean that after step 8, they have three entries. But in the step 8 description, they read the document but haven't appended yet. So the next action should be to append the new value from step 8's read.\n\nWait, the prior steps: step 5 appended one (8/20), step 7 appended another (7/28). Step 8's read would be for the Second Revised, which has 8/7. So after reading that, they need to append it. So the next action should be append_checklist for Dates_of_All_Decrees with the new date.\n\nBut the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", so maybe they've already appended it. Wait, no. The step 8 is the read_document, and the next step would be to append. But the current status is after step 8, so perhaps they have three values. Wait, the status says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", so maybe they have three: 7/28, 8/7, 8/20. So the next step would be to check if there are more documents to read.\n\nLooking at the available documents: the Docket, Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, and Second Revised TRO are all fully visited. The other three documents (Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Motion for TRO) are unvisited. But do those contain decree dates?\n\nThe checklist says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to check if the unvisited documents have any decree dates. However, the decree dates are likely in the court orders (the TROs and revised versions), which have been read. The Complaint might have dates, but the Checklist definition specifies \"decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates...\". The Complaint is a filing, not a decree, so it probably doesn't have decree dates. Similarly, the Motion for TRO would have filing dates, but not the decree entry date.\n\nWait, the Motion for TRO (step 8's document) is the one that was filed on 7/21, but the decree date is when the court entered the order. The Motion for TRO itself doesn't have the decree date; the order does. So the only decree dates are in the TRO documents and the Docket entries that mention the order dates.\n\nThe Docket already has the 8/20/2025 entry (from document 47), which is the Third Revised Order. The Temporary Restraining Order (document 23) has 7/28/2025. The Second Revised (document 37) has 8/7/2025. Are there any other decree dates?\n\nThe Docket also lists other entries, but they're motions, hearings, etc., not decrees. The Checklist specifically says \"decree-related dates\", so only the dates where the court entered an order (like the TROs and their revisions) count. The Docket has \"23 | 2025-07-28 | ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO\" which is the 7/28 date, and \"34 | 2025-08-07 | AMENDED ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO\" (so 8/7), and \"47 | 2025-08-20 | THIRD REVISED ORDER granting 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" (8/20). So those three dates are already covered.\n\nNow, the unvisited documents: Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Motion for TRO. The Motion for TRO (the pleading) would have the filing date (7/21), but that's not a decree date. The Complaint's filing date is 7/21, but again, not a decree. So the decree dates are all in the orders and the Docket entries that reference the orders. Since the orders have been read and their dates extracted, and the Docket has the same dates, there are no more decree dates to extract.\n\nWait, but the user's current status shows all three values already extracted. So the next action should be to check if all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key: Dates_of_All_Decrees, and it's fully extracted with three values. So the next step would be to stop.\n\nBut let's confirm: the Checklist Summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", \"Not Applicable: 0/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All decree dates extracted: 07/28/2025 (Temporary Restraining Order), 08/07/2025 (Second Revised TRO), 08/20/2025 (Third Revised Order).

The user is asking me to extract all decree dates from legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees. From the recent actions, they've already extracted three dates: 07/28/2025, 08/07/2025, and 08/20/2025. Wait, but in the provided steps, step 9 mentions 08/20/2025 as part of the stop, but looking at the documents they've read so far—Temporary Restraining Order (07/28), Second Revised (08/07)—where's the 08/20 date coming from?\n\nHmm, the documents they've fully visited are Docket, Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, and Temporary TRO. The other three documents are unvisited: Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for TRO. But the user's step 9 says they stopped with three values, including 08/20/2025. Wait, but in the text provided for Step 8 (Second Revised TRO), the date is 08/07/25, and the order says it's effective until September 4, but no 08/20 date is mentioned there.\n\nWait, maybe the Docket document (which they read in step 4) has the 08/20 date. Let me check the Docket details. The Docket was read from tokens 0-7409, but the evidence from step 5's append_checklist mentions a value from Docket. The step 5 says they appended one value from Docket. The step 7's extracted value was from Temporary TRO (07/28), step 9's stop mentions three values: 07/28, 08/07, and 08/20. So the 08/20 must be from the Docket.\n\nBut the current status says \"Keys with Extracted Values: 1/1\" with 3 values. The checklist summary shows all filled. The available documents include three unvisited ones (Complaint, Motion for Relief, Motion for TRO), but the user's last action was step 9 where they called stop, then step 10 was get_checklist. The system says \"All decree dates extracted: 07/28/2025 (Temporary Restraining Order), 08/07/2025 (Second Revised TRO), 08/20/2025 (Third Revised Order).\"\n\nWait, but the Third Revised Order document isn't listed in the available documents. The documents are Docket, Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, Complaint, Motion for Relief, Motion for TRO. The Third Revised Order might be the Revised TRO? But in the text, Revised TRO was read in step 2, and it's dated 07/28. Wait, the Revised TRO document's header says \"Filed 07/28/25\", but the Second Revised is 08/07. So maybe the Third Revised is another document, but it's not listed. Wait, the user's step 9 says \"Third Revised Order\" but the documents available don't have that. The Docket might have the 08/20 date.\n\nWait, the Docket was read in step 4. The Docket's evidence was used in step 5's append_checklist. The step 5 says \"Successfully appended 1 value for 1 key: Dates_of_All_Decrees\". So the Docket probably contains the 08/20 date. But in the current status, the checklist has 3 values, so the Docket must have provided the third date.\n\nBut the current step is after the stop attempt. The system says \"Checklist Status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty\" and \"Filled keys: Dates_of_All_Decrees: 3 values\". So all three dates are already extracted. The user's last action was stop, but the system is prompting to either stop again or continue. Since the checklist is fully filled (3 values), and all documents that might have more dates (the unvisited ones) are not ordered to be read because the system says \"All decree dates extracted\". Wait, but the unvisited documents could potentially have more dates. However, the user's step 9 claimed all three were confirmed from fully visited documents. But the Third Revised Order (08/20) might be in the Docket, which is fully visited.\n\nWait, the Docket is a document that's fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). So the 08/20 date must be in the Docket. The Docket was read in step 4 (tokens 0-7409), and in step 5, they appended one value from it. So the Docket has the 08/20 date.\n\nNow, the current status shows that all three values are extracted. The user's task is to extract all decree dates. Since the checklist has 3 values, and the system says it's filled, the next step should be to stop. The system's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, all keys (only one key) is filled with 3 values.\n\nThe user's step 9 already called stop, but the system says \"this is stop attempt 1/2\", so they need to call stop again to confirm. The next action should be to call stop again.\n\nWait, but the user is supposed to choose one action. The current state shows that the checklist is fully filled (3 values), so the correct action is to stop. The reason is that all decree dates have been extracted from the fully visited documents, and no more documents need to be read because the unvisited ones (Complaint, Motion for Relief, Motion for TRO) are not likely to contain decree dates (since decree dates are in court orders, not pleadings or complaints). The checklist specifically says to extract dates from decrees, injunctions, consent decrees, etc., which would be in the Order/Opinion documents. The unvisited documents are Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for TRO—these are pleadings, not the actual orders. So they probably don't contain decree dates, so there's no need to read them.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All decree dates (07/28/2025, 08/07/2025, 08/20/2025) confirmed from fully visited documents.
