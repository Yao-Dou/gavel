Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is unknown. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the first step should be to list all available documents.\n\nThe available actions include list_documents, which is the correct first step here.

The user needs to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. They want each distinct term as a separate entry with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, all 7 documents are unvisited (marked with ○). The checklist item is empty, so no values have been extracted yet. The task is to start extracting from these documents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain the decree terms. The documents listed include a Complaint, Docket, several Orders (Temporary Restraining Orders), and Motions. The decree terms would most likely be in the court orders, like the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order,\" \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order,\" and \"Temporary Restraining Order.\" These are court orders, so they probably contain the terms.\n\nThe Docket might have a summary, but the actual terms are more likely in the orders themselves. The Motions and Complaint might mention the requested relief, but the actual decree terms would be in the court's order. So, focusing on the Order/Opinion documents makes sense.\n\nThe first step is to read one of these order documents. Let's pick the \"Temporary Restraining Order\" since it's the first in the list. It's 1,909 tokens, which is under the 10k limit. Since it's unvisited, I should call read_document on that.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to choose exactly one action per turn. The previous step was list_documents, which found 7 docs. Now, the next logical step is to read a document. Since the decree terms are in the orders, not the motions or complaint, starting with the Temporary Restraining Order seems right.\n\nCheck the document catalog: all are unvisited, so no need to check viewed tokens. Just read the entire document since it's small. The start_token should be 0, end_token 1909. Wait, the document has 1,909 tokens, so end_token would be 1909. But the read_document function takes start_token inclusive and end_token exclusive. So reading from 0 to 1909.\n\nI should use read_document on \"Temporary Restraining Order\" [Order/Opinion] with start_token 0 and end_token 1909. That's the first step to get the text to extract terms from.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1909}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1909}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3405, "completion_tokens": 559, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all distinct \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the provided documents. \n\nFirst, I'll review what's been done so far. Step 1 listed 7 documents, and Step 2 read the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) document from tokens 0-1909. Now I need to analyze that TRO text to see if it contains any decree terms.\n\nLooking at the TRO document excerpt, I notice it has specific court-ordered injunctions. The key sections are numbered 1 and 2 under \"The Court ORDERS as follows\". \n\nFor Section 1(a), there are four sub-terms (i-iv) about HUD funding conditions:\n- i. Ban on \"gender ideology\" funding\n- ii. Anti-discrimination law compliance certification\n- iii. Ban on abortion funding\n- iv. Executive Order compliance condition\n\nSection 2(a) has one HHS-related term about DEI certification:\n- i. Certification against DEI/DEIA programs\n\nThe document also mentions other court orders (like nullifying conditions), but those aren't substantive decree terms - they're implementation orders. The checklist specifically says to extract \"substantive obligations ordered by the court\", so I'll focus on the injunctions themselves.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless expressly incorporated\". This TRO is a court order, so these terms are directly ordered. Good.\n\nNow I need to extract each unique term as a separate entry with evidence. Let me list them:\n\n1. \"The requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168...\" (from 1.a.i)\n2. \"The requirement that the recipient 'agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material...' (1.a.ii)\n3. \"The requirement that the recipient 'not use any Grant Funds to fund or promote elective abortions, as required by E.O. 14182...\" (1.a.iii)\n4. \"The condition that 'the Recipient’s use of funds... are governed by... all current Executive Orders.'\" (1.a.iv)\n5. \"The requirement that recipients must 'certify[] that [they] do not... operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology...' (2.a.i)\n\nEach of these is a distinct court-ordered term. I'll need to create separate evidence entries for each. The evidence should include the exact text snippet, document name, and location (which I'll specify as \"Page 2, Section 1.a.i\" etc. since token ranges are already covered).\n\nI should use `append_checklist` to add these five entries since they're new values. The checklist key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and each entry needs its own evidence. \n\nWait, the document says \"extract each term as a separate value\" - yes, these are five distinct terms. The TRO is the only document read so far, and it's fully visited, so no need to read other documents yet. \n\nI'll structure the append_checklist with five entries under the same key. Each entry must have:\n- value: the exact term\n- evidence: with text, source_document, location\n\nLet me verify no duplicates. All five terms are unique. The \"DEI certification\" term is different from the other DEI-related references. \n\nAlso confirming these are court-ordered terms (not just settlement terms), so they qualify per the checklist. The TRO explicitly says \"the Court ORDERS\" these conditions.\n\nTime to format the JSON for append_checklist. I'll make sure each evidence entry has the required fields. Location can be \"Page 2, Section 1.a.i\" since page numbers are in the document headers.\n\nNo Not Applicable here - the TRO contains clear terms. I'll proceed with appending these five terms.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"The requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"i.

The Complaint and Motions might mention settlement terms, but the instructions say to exclude terms only in settlement agreements unless they're expressly incorporated into the court order.

The other documents might not have the decree terms, or if they do, they might not be part of the court's order.\n\nThe user needs to check if there are any other documents that might contain unique terms.

The Second Revised TRO might have more terms, but since the Revised TRO was already read and it's a duplicate, maybe the Second Revised one is similar. However, the current state shows that Revised TRO is fully visited, but the Second Revised is unvisited. Wait, the available documents list \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" as unvisited. But the user's recent action was reading the Revised TRO (Document 34), not the Second Revised. So maybe the Second Revised is a different document that hasn't been checked yet.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was Step 4: reading Revised Temporary Restraining Order (tokens 0-1959). The document catalog shows that Revised TRO is fully visited. The Second Revised TRO is listed as unvisited. So maybe the Second Revised TRO has different terms.

So the Second Revised might be similar. However, the user's current checklist has 5 values already, and the Revised TRO doesn't add any new ones. The next step would be to check if the Second Revised TRO (which is unvisited) has any new terms. But since the user's task is to extract from all documents, they should check the remaining unvisited documents.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to court-ordered terms. The Complaint, Docket, Motions, and Second Revised TRO might not have the decree terms. The TROs are the court orders, so the terms are in those. The Complaint might mention what the plaintiffs are seeking, but not the court's decree. The Docket would list filings but not the terms. The Motions might reference the terms, but the decree terms are in the TROs.\n\nSo the main documents to check are the TROs.

So no new terms there. The next logical step would be to check if the Second Revised TRO has any different terms. But the user hasn't read it yet. However, the problem is that the user needs to stop when all applicable items are extracted. Since the checklist item is only about the decree terms from the court orders, and the TROs (both Temporary and Revised) have been read and provide the same terms, maybe there are no more distinct terms. But the Second Revised TRO might have additional terms.\n\nWait, but the user's available documents include \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" as unvisited. To be thorough, they should check that document. However, given that the Revised TRO (Document 34) is a revision of the Temporary, the Second Revised might be a further revision. But since the user's current status shows that the Revised TRO was fully visited and contains the same terms as the Temporary, it's possible that the Second Revised is redundant. However, the user can't assume that; they have to check.\n\nBut the task is to extract all distinct values. If the Second Revised TRO has the same terms, then no new entries. If it has different terms, then they need to add them. So the correct action would be to read the Second Revised TRO to check.\n\nWait, but the user's available documents list \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" as unvisited, so they should read it. But the user's last action was reading the Revised TRO (Document 34), which is a different document from the Second Revised. So the next step is to read the Second Revised TRO. But the user has to choose one action. The options are to read a document, search, etc.\n\nBut the user's checklist already has 5 values, and the Revised TRO didn't add any new ones. The Second Revised TRO might have the same terms. However, to be safe, they should read the Second Revised TRO to confirm. If it's a duplicate, they can stop. If it's different, they need to append.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should use get_checklist to see if there are any other keys, but the checklist only has one key. Wait, the checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which is the only key. So all values are already extracted from the two TROs. But the user needs to make sure there are no other documents with the terms.\n\nWait, the user's current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 5\", and the available documents include the Second Revised TRO, which hasn't been read. So the correct action is to read the Second Revised TRO to check if it has new terms. If it does, append; if not, then stop.\n\nBut looking at the content of the Revised TRO provided, it's identical to the Temporary TRO. The Second Revised might be the same. However, the user can't assume that. So the next action should be to read the Second Revised TRO. But the user has to choose one action. The available actions are read_document, etc.\n\nThe document \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" is unvisited, so the next step is to read it. But the user should read the entire document (tokens 0-1996) since it's unvisited. Wait, the document is 1,996 tokens, and the user can read up to 10,000 tokens. So the action would be read_document for \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" with start_token 0 and end_token 1996.\n\nBut the user's recent action was reading the Revised TRO (Document 34), which is different from the Second Revised. So the next logical step is to read the Second Revised TRO.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should check if there's a need to read other documents. But the Complaint and Motions are less likely to have the decree terms. The Docket would have dates and events, not the terms. So the most likely document with additional terms is the Second Revised TRO.\n\nWait, the user's previous steps read the Temporary and Revised TROs, which are both court orders with the terms. The Second Revised is another court order, so it's possible it has the same terms. But to be thorough, they need to check.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1996}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1996}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8288, "completion_tokens": 1869, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Since the TROs are court orders, and they've already covered all the TROs (including revised versions), the remaining documents probably don't contain additional decree terms.\n\nThe current extraction has 5 values, all from the first TRO, and the revisions didn't add anything new. So, there are no more decree terms to extract. The \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" key is already fully populated. The other keys (if there were any) are empty, but the checklist only has this one item. Wait, the checklist definitions mention only \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" as the item to extract. So there's only one key, and it's already filled with 5 values. The empty keys count is 0, and not applicable is 0. So all keys are done.\n\nThe next step should be to stop because all applicable checklist items are extracted. The user has confirmed all the terms from the relevant documents, and the other documents aren't expected to have additional decree terms. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All 5 distinct decree terms from court orders (Temporary Restraining Order and revisions) have been extracted with evidence.

The user has provided a legal checklist extraction task, and I need to determine the next action based on the current status.\n\nFirst, reviewing the snapshot. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and the system has already extracted 5 distinct values from the Temporary Restraining Order and its revisions. The recent actions show that Steps 3-5 added those 5 values via append_checklist. Step 6 was a stop attempt, but the system automatically ran get_checklist, showing that the key is filled with 5 values.\n\nLooking at the available documents: the three TRO documents are fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), meaning all tokens have been read. The other documents (Complaint, Docket, Motions) are unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the task is to extract decree terms from court orders. The checklist definition specifies that only terms from court orders (like decrees, stipulated judgments) should be included, not from settlement agreements or other documents. The Complaint, Docket, and Motions aren't court orders, so they likely don't contain the decree terms. The system's note in Step 6 says: \"Remaining documents (Complaint, Docket, Motions) do not contain decree terms as they are not court orders.\"\n\nThe checklist status shows 1 key filled with 5 values, and no empty keys or Not Applicable entries. The system's automatic check (Step 7) confirms that the key is fully populated. The user's instruction says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the only key is filled with 5 verified values from the court orders.\n\nThe next action should be to stop, as all required values are extracted. The system has already done a get_checklist and confirmed the status. The user's previous stop attempt (Step 6) was followed by an automatic get_checklist, and now the system is prompting for a final stop. The instructions say to stop when all keys are complete. Since there's only one key and it's filled, the correct action is to return the stop decision with the reason.\n\nI need to make sure there's no missing data. The documents that are unvisited (Complaint, etc.) aren't relevant because they're not court orders, so no need to read them. The evidence for all 5 terms is already in the TRO documents, which have been fully read. The system's Step 6 summary states \"All 5 distinct decree terms from court orders (Temporary Restraining Order and revisions) have been extracted with evidence.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action is to stop. The JSON should be {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All 5 distinct decree terms extracted from court orders; remaining documents are not court orders and do not contain decree terms.\"}\n\nNo other actions are needed. The checklist is complete.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 5 distinct decree terms extracted from court orders (Temporary Restraining Order and revisions); remaining documents are not court orders and do not contain decree terms.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All 5 distinct decree terms extracted from court orders (Temporary Restraining Order and revisions); remaining documents are not court orders and do not contain decree terms.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8676, "completion_tokens": 640, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
