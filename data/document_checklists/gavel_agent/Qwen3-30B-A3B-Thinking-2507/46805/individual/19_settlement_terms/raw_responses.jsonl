The user needs to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from legal documents. The checklist item specifies that they should only include terms not entered as court orders, so I have to be careful not to include anything from the Orders/Opinions.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents. There are seven documents, all unvisited. The key ones to check would be the pleadings and motions where settlements might be discussed, rather than the orders themselves. The Complaint and the Motions (like the one for TRO or Preliminary Injunction) are more likely to contain settlement terms before court approval.\n\nThe Revised Temporary Restraining Orders and the TROs are court orders, so according to the checklist, terms in those shouldn't be included. So those might not be the right places to look. The Complaint might mention settlement terms if they're part of the case, but usually complaints are about the claims, not settlements. The motions, especially the one for TRO, might have settlement discussions if they're negotiating.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"settlement terms\" that are not court-ordered. So if the settlement is in a motion or a pleading, that's the place to look. The Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order might reference a settlement agreement. Similarly, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction could have settlement terms.\n\nBut the user hasn't read any documents yet. The previous step was list_documents, which found 7 docs. Now, the next step should be to read a document. Which one? Since the Orders are court orders, they probably don't have the settlement terms (since those would be in the agreement, not the order). So the best candidates are the Motions and the Complaint.\n\nThe Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO is 2,080 tokens. That's a good candidate. Maybe the settlement terms are mentioned there. Alternatively, the Complaint might have a settlement in the body, but it's less likely. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3,183 tokens) might also be relevant.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"not entered as a court order\", so the settlement terms would be in a separate agreement, not the court's order. So the motions or pleadings might reference that agreement. So reading the Motion for TRO first makes sense. Let's pick that document. The document name is \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" [Pleading / Motion / Brief]. It's unvisited, so I can read it.\n\nI should use read_document to get the text. Since it's 2,080 tokens, I can read the whole document. Start_token 0, end_token 2080. Wait, the document has 2,080 tokens, so reading from 0 to 2080 would cover the whole thing. But the tool parameters require start and end tokens. The maximum per call is 10,000, which is more than enough. So I'll set start_token to 0 and end_token to 2080.\n\nWait, but the document's token count is 2,080, so the end_token should be 2080. So the parameters would be doc_name: \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\", start_token: 0, end_token: 2080.\n\nI should choose read_document as the next action. The other option is search_document_regex, but since I don't have a specific pattern yet, reading the document directly is better. The checklist item is about settlement terms, so the document might have the term \"settlement\" or \"terms\" in it. But without knowing the exact text, reading the whole doc is safer. So the next action is read_document for that motion.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2080}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2080}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3424, "completion_tokens": 839, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state after Step 2, which was reading the Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the document they read contains any settlement terms. The document they read is the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. The checklist definition says to extract terms that are part of a settlement, not court-ordered terms. The Motion is asking for a TRO, which is a court order, not a settlement. So the terms mentioned in the Motion are probably the ones the defendants are requiring, but these are conditions for funding, not settlement terms. The Motion is about stopping the defendants from enforcing certain conditions, so it's not a settlement.\n\nLooking at the document's content, the plaintiffs are asking the court to enjoin the defendants from requiring specific conditions for funding. The terms listed (like not using funds for gender ideology, etc.) are part of the funding requirements, not settlement terms. The checklist specifies not to include terms that are court-ordered, but this is a motion to prevent those conditions from being enforced, so the terms here are part of the dispute, not a settlement. Therefore, this document doesn't contain settlement terms.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The available documents include the Complaint, Docket, and several Orders. The Orders (like Temporary Restraining Order, Revised TRO, etc.) are court orders, so they might have settlement terms if the case settled, but the case is still ongoing as per the TROs. The Complaint is the initial filing, which likely doesn't have settlement terms. The Docket might list events, but not settlement terms.\n\nSince the current document (Motion for TRO) was fully visited and doesn't have the required terms, I should look at other documents. The next logical step is to read the Complaint, as it's the first document in the case and might contain more details. The Complaint is 43k tokens, but since it's unvisited, I can read it. However, the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited docs, but this one is unvisited. So the next action should be to read the Complaint document.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\", which is for settlement terms. If the case hasn't settled yet (since they're asking for a TRO), there might not be any settlement terms. But the user's instructions say to extract from documents, so I need to check all documents. The Complaint might not have settlement terms, but maybe the Docket or other documents do. However, the Docket is a list of events, so it's less likely to have the terms. The Orders might have if there was a settlement, but the TROs are temporary and not settlements.\n\nWait, the user's note says \"a settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" So if there's a settlement agreement that's not part of the court order, that's what we need. But in this case, the documents provided are motions, complaints, and TROs, which are all part of the litigation process, not settlements. So maybe there are no settlement terms to extract. But according to the instructions, we can't assume that; we have to check all documents.\n\nBut the current status shows that \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" is empty. The user's recent actions read the Motion for TRO, which didn't have settlement terms. So the next step is to check other documents. The Complaint is the next candidate. So I should call read_document on the Complaint, starting from 0 tokens, since it's unvisited.\n\nWait, the available documents list the Complaint as \"○ Unvisited\" and 43,025 tokens. So I need to read a part of it. Since it's unvisited, I can read the entire document, but the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens. So I'll start with tokens 0-10,000. But the system says not to reread visited documents, which this isn't. So the next action should be read_document on Complaint, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5735, "completion_tokens": 959, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is trying to extract the settlement terms from legal documents. The checklist item they need is \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\", which requires identifying substantive obligations in a settlement not entered as a court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: They've read two documents so far. The first was the Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (tokens 0-2080), and the second was the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (tokens 0-10000). The error in Step 4 was a parse error, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nThe current status shows that \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" is empty. The documents they've read so far are motions and complaints, which are part of the legal proceedings but not settlements themselves. Settlement terms would typically be in a settlement agreement or consent decree, not in motions or complaints.\n\nChecking the available documents: The corpus includes a Complaint (partially read), a Motion (fully read), and several Orders (like Temporary Restraining Order, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, etc.). The Orders are court-issued, so they might contain terms that are court-ordered, but the checklist specifically says to exclude terms entered as court orders. The settlement terms should be non-court-ordered, so they're likely in a settlement agreement document.\n\nLooking at the document list, there's no \"Settlement Agreement\" mentioned. The documents available are Complaint, Motion, Docket, and various Orders. The Orders are court orders, so they wouldn't contain the settlement terms as per the checklist requirements. The Docket might have some info, but it's usually just a summary of filings.\n\nThe user needs to find where the settlement terms are. Since the Complaint and Motion don't mention settlement terms (they're about seeking a TRO and injunction), the settlement terms might be in a different document. But the available documents don't include a settlement agreement. Wait, the checklist says \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So if there's a settlement, it's probably not yet court-approved, so the terms would be in a settlement agreement that's not yet filed as an order.\n\nBut looking at the documents listed, none of them are labeled as settlement agreements. The Docket might list a settlement, but it's unvisited. The Docket is a document type that lists filings, so maybe the settlement terms are referenced there. However, the Docket is usually just a list of documents, not the content of the settlement.\n\nWait, the user has to extract terms from the documents provided. The current documents don't seem to have a settlement agreement. The Complaint and Motion are about the lawsuit, not a settlement. The Orders are court orders, so any terms in them would be excluded per the checklist.\n\nThe next step would be to check if there's a document that contains the settlement terms. Since the Complaint and Motion don't have it, maybe the Docket (unvisited) has a reference. But the Docket is likely to be a list of filings, so it might not contain the actual terms. Alternatively, maybe the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705...\" is unvisited and might have settlement terms, but that's a motion for preliminary injunction, which is part of the lawsuit, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"a settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" So if there's a settlement agreement that's not yet approved, it's not an order, so the terms should be extracted. But the documents provided don't include such a settlement agreement. The available documents are all part of the lawsuit proceedings.\n\nGiven that, maybe there are no settlement terms to extract because the case is still ongoing and no settlement has been reached. But the checklist requires extracting terms if they exist. If the documents don't contain any settlement terms, then the key should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user has to check all documents. The Docket is unvisited, so maybe it mentions a settlement. But typically, dockets don't have the terms, just the fact that a settlement was filed. However, the user's instructions say to mark as Not Applicable only if there's explicit evidence, like \"no settlement\" or dismissal.\n\nLooking at the documents read so far: The Complaint (page 1-19) talks about the lawsuit but doesn't mention a settlement. The Motion (pages 1-6) is for a TRO, so no settlement terms there. The Orders are court orders, so their terms are excluded.\n\nThe next step is to check the Docket document, which is unvisited. The Docket might list the filings, including a settlement agreement. But since it's unvisited, the assistant should read it to check for any references to settlement terms.\n\nSo the correct action is to read the Docket document. The Docket is 7,409 tokens, so reading it entirely (since it's unvisited) is allowed. The maximum read is 10,000 tokens, which is more than 7,409. So the next action should be `read_document` on the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 7409.\n\nWait, the document catalog says \"Docket [Docket] - 7,409 tokens - ○ Unvisited\", so it's unvisited. The next action should be to read it to see if it contains any settlement terms.\n\nThe other documents like the Orders are court orders, so even if they mention settlement terms, those terms would be court-ordered, so they should be excluded. But the Docket might have a reference to a settlement agreement document, which might contain the terms. However, the Docket itself is unlikely to have the terms; the actual settlement agreement would be a separate document. But since the corpus has only these 7 documents, and none are labeled as settlement agreements, maybe there is no settlement document, so the key should be Not Applicable.\n\nBut the assistant shouldn't assume that yet. They need to check all documents. The Docket is the next logical step to check for any mention of settlement terms.\n\nSo the correct action is to call `read_document` on the Docket document (name \"Docket\") from tokens 0 to 7409.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7409}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7409}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16367, "completion_tokens": 1386, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all settlement terms from the provided documents, specifically focusing on \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" as defined in the checklist. \n\nFirst, I'll review the current status. The checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" is empty, and we have 7 documents in the corpus. The \"Docket\" and \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" are fully visited, while the \"Complaint\" is partially visited (only 23% covered). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 was a read_document on the Complaint (tokens 0-10000), but it got cut off at \"HUD has begun carrying out Executive Orders by imposing new conditions on federal funding—through a new policy for Continuums of Care awards, a new\". So the Complaint document is partially read, but the key part about settlement terms might be in the unvisited portion.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Extract the substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" The key here is to distinguish between court-ordered terms (like consent decrees) and actual settlement terms. The documents provided seem to be legal filings (motions, complaint, docket), not a settlement agreement itself. \n\nI need to check if any of these documents contain settlement terms. The Complaint (Step 3) mentions \"HUD has begun imposing new conditions\" but doesn't describe a settlement. The Motion for TRO (Step 2) lists conditions being enforced, but again, these are administrative conditions, not settlement terms. The Docket (Step 5) shows court proceedings but no settlement.\n\nHmm, the problem is that the user is asking for \"settlement terms\" but the documents provided are all pre-settlement (motions, complaint, docket entries). There's no actual settlement agreement document in the corpus. The \"Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" are court orders, not settlements.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So court orders are excluded. But the documents here don't contain any settlement terms at all—they're all about the legal challenge to the new funding conditions.\n\nI should check if the Complaint might have any settlement terms. In Step 3, the Complaint was read up to page 19 (tokens 0-10000), and it's about the plaintiffs' allegations against the defendants. The complaint states that the defendants \"are now forcing grantees to agree to various new conditions\" but these are conditions being imposed by the government, not terms of a settlement. The plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin these conditions, not settle on them.\n\nThe Motion for TRO (Step 2) lists the specific conditions the plaintiffs want to enjoin, such as \"The requirement that the recipient not 'use grant funds to promote 'gender ideology,' as defined in E.O. 14168...\" But again, these are conditions the government is imposing, not settlement terms. The plaintiffs are fighting against these conditions, not agreeing to them as part of a settlement.\n\nSo, based on the documents provided, there are no settlement terms to extract. The case is still in motion (TRO granted, but no settlement yet). Therefore, \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. The checklist requires explicit evidence for Not Applicable. The evidence should be something like \"No settlement has been reached; the case is ongoing with a TRO in place.\" Looking at the Docket (Step 5), it shows the TRO was granted (ECF 23), and there's a motion for preliminary injunction (ECF 30), so the case is still active. No settlement agreement exists in the documents.\n\nTherefore, I should use `update_checklist` to set \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" to Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket showing the case is ongoing with a TRO and no settlement mentioned.\n\nWait, but the Docket does mention \"Temporary Restraining Order\" (ECF 23, 34, 37, 47), but it's a court order, not a settlement. The key point is that there's no settlement document or agreement in the corpus. The plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the government from imposing these conditions, not settling on them.\n\nSo the evidence for Not Applicable would be the Docket entries showing the case is ongoing with a TRO, and no settlement terms are present in any document. For example, the Docket shows \"ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO\" and subsequent motions for preliminary injunction, but no settlement.\n\nI should check if the \"Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" documents (which are unvisited) might contain settlement terms, but the name suggests they're court orders, not settlements. The checklist specifies not to include court-ordered terms, so even if they had terms, they'd be excluded. But the main point is that there's no settlement agreement here.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to set the key to Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket showing the case is active and no settlement has occurred.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Case remains active with Temporary Restraining Order granted (ECF 23), subsequent motions for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 30), and ongoing compliance notices (ECF 24, 25, 41, 48).
