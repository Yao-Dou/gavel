The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and there are no documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next step is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows 0 out of 1 key filled. All documents are unvisited. So I need to start by checking the documents. The available documents include things like Amended Complaint, Docket, various motions, etc. The most likely places to find class action status would be in the Complaint, the Amended Complaint, maybe the Motions, or the Docket.\n\nSince the documents are all unvisited, I should probably start with the main complaint documents. The \"Amended Complaint\" and \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" are the primary ones. The Amended Complaint has 49k tokens, which is a lot, but I can't read the whole thing at once. The max per read is 10k tokens. So I should read a portion of the Amended Complaint first.\n\nWait, but the instructions say not to reread documents already visited, but since none are visited, I can pick any. The Amended Complaint is the first in the list, so maybe start there. The user's recent actions already did list_documents, so now I need to read a document.\n\nThe goal is to find if it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nSo, reading the Amended Complaint. Let's pick the first 10k tokens. The document name is \"Amended Complaint\" [Complaint]. Start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the token count is 49,043, so 0-10000 is safe. Need to make sure to use read_document with those parameters. The other option is to search for a regex pattern like \"Class Action\" or \"Individual Plaintiffs\", but maybe it's better to read the document first to get the context. Since the user said to use read_document as default for targeted reading.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Amended Complaint\" from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Amended Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3656, "completion_tokens": 522, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, found 15 docs. Step 2 was read_document on Amended Complaint (tokens 0-10000). The provided text from that document shows the plaintiffs are listed as \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts; State of California; State of Maryland; ... and State of Wisconsin\" as Plaintiffs. The complaint is titled \"AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and the plaintiffs are multiple states acting together. \n\nThe key here is whether this is a class action or individual plaintiffs. Since multiple states are suing as a group, it's a class action. The document doesn't mention individual plaintiffs; all are states. The format should be 'Plaintiffs: Class Action'. \n\nNow, checking the current status: the key is empty. The extracted value needs to be added. The evidence is the text from the document where the plaintiffs are listed as a group of states. The location is the beginning of the complaint, page 1-2. \n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist to add this value. The evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text snippet would be the part where it says \"Plaintiffs, Commonwealth of Massachusetts; State of California; ... State of Wisconsin\". The source is \"Amended Complaint\", location is page 1 of the document (tokens 0-10000 as read).\n\nWait, the document says \"Plaintiffs, Commonwealth of Massachusetts; State of California; ... State of Wisconsin\". So the plaintiffs are a group of states, so it's a class action. The extracted value should be \"Class Action\". The required format is 'Plaintiffs: Class Action'.\n\nNeed to make sure the evidence is correctly cited. The text snippet should be the exact line where plaintiffs are listed. The document shows \"COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS; STATE OF CALIFORNIA; ... STATE OF WISCONSIN, Plaintiffs,\". So the verbatim text is that list followed by \"Plaintiffs,\". The source is \"Amended Complaint\", location is \"Page 1 of 92\" as per the header.\n\nSo the evidence entry should have:\n- text: \"COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS; STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF MARYLAND; STATE OF WASHINGTON; STATE OF ARIZONA; STATE OF COLORADO; STATE OF DELAWARE; STATE OF HAWAIʻI; STATE OF MINNESOTA; STATE OF NEVADA; STATE OF NEW JERSEY; STATE OF NEW MEXICO; STATE OF NEW YORK; STATE OF OREGON; STATE OF RHODE ISLAND; and STATE OF WISCONSIN, Plaintiffs,\"\n- source_document: \"Amended Complaint\"\n- location: \"Page 1 of 92\"\n\nThen the value is \"Class Action\", so the full key value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nSince this is the first extraction, append_checklist is the right action. The checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and we're appending one entry with that value and evidence.\n\nCheck if any other documents need to be read. The current read was on Amended Complaint, which has the info. No need to search other documents yet.

The user is working on extracting the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need to extract is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Amended Complaint. The evidence shows that the plaintiffs are listed as multiple states, which indicates a class action. The extracted value is \"Class Action\", which fits the requirement.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other documents that might have more information about the class action status. The available documents include several complaints, motions, orders, etc. The Amended Complaint is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but the document is 49,043 tokens long, so there's more to read. However, the user's previous action was to read the first 10,000 tokens of the Amended Complaint and found the class action mention.\n\nThe next step is to determine if there's more relevant information in the same document or if other documents should be checked. The checklist item only needs to capture whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. Since the Amended Complaint already states that the plaintiffs are multiple states (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, etc.), it's clear this is a class action. The document is a complaint, so it's likely the main source for this information.\n\nBut wait, the user's current status shows that the Amended Complaint is partially visited (20% coverage). However, the relevant part was found in the first 10,000 tokens (page 1), so maybe there's no need to read further in the same document. The other documents like the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief or motions might not have additional info on the class action status, as the complaint itself defines the plaintiffs.\n\nThe user's recent action was to append the checklist with the found value. Now, they need to check if all necessary info is extracted. Since the checklist item only requires one value (class action), and they've already extracted it from the Amended Complaint, there's no need for more documents. The other documents might be related to motions or orders, but the class action status is established in the complaint.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". In this case, there's only one value: Class Action. So once that's extracted, the key is filled. The current status shows 1 value extracted out of 1 key, so all keys are filled. The next step should be to confirm if there's any other possible value, but given the document, it's clear it's a class action. The user should stop now.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Amended Complaint lists multiple states as plaintiffs, which is a classic example of a class action (where multiple states sue as a group). The extracted value is correct. No other documents need to be checked for this specific item because the complaint itself establishes the plaintiff structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop, as all required values are extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs fully extracted with 'Class Action' evidence from Amended Complaint (Page 1, tokens 0-10000).

Step 2 read the Amended Complaint from tokens 0-10000. Step 3 appended the checklist with the value \"Class Action\" from the Amended Complaint. Step 4 tried to stop, but the system automatically ran get_checklist, showing that Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs has 1 value.\n\nNow, the current status shows that the key is filled (1/1), but the document \"Amended Complaint\" is only partially visited (20% coverage). The user's task is to extract ALL distinct values. The Amended Complaint's first page lists multiple states as plaintiffs, which indicates a class action. But I need to make sure there aren't other documents that might have different information, like individual plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting every distinct value. The Amended Complaint shows multiple states acting together, so it's a class action. But maybe other documents, like the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief or other pleadings, might have different details. However, the recent actions only read the Amended Complaint so far.\n\nThe available documents include other complaint types and motions. But the Amended Complaint is the main document where the plaintiffs are listed. The other documents might be motions or orders, which probably don't describe the plaintiff structure again. For example, the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" is a motion, not the complaint itself. The \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" might not restate the plaintiff type.\n\nThe system says the key is already filled with one value. But the user's instructions say to extract all distinct values. Since the Amended Complaint clearly states multiple states as plaintiffs (a class action), and there's no indication of individual plaintiffs, maybe that's the only value. However, the system's automatic check after step 4 says it's fully extracted.\n\nWait, the \"Current Status\" says 1/1 keys filled. The extraction progress shows one value from Amended Complaint. The user's step 4 tried to stop, but the system requires a second stop attempt. The system's note says \"This is stop attempt 1/2 (system will accept second stop as final)\".\n\nSo, the next action should be to stop again because all keys are filled. The checklist item has one value, which is confirmed from the Amended Complaint. There's no evidence of individual plaintiffs, so no need to look further. The other documents might not have relevant info, and rereading the same document isn't needed since the value is already extracted.\n\nThe user's instructions say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable.
