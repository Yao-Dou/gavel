The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet.

The user needs the Filing_Date extracted from legal documents. The current status shows all documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), and no values have been extracted yet.\n\nFirst, I should check which document is most likely to contain the filing date. In legal cases, the Complaint is typically the first filed document, so the Filing_Date would probably be in the Complaint or the Docket. The Docket usually lists the filing date as the first entry. \n\nThe available documents are:\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Complaint)\n- Docket\n- Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion\n\nSince the Docket is a log of court actions, it's the most probable place for the filing date. The Complaint might have it, but the Docket is more reliable for the initial filing date. So, I should read the Docket first.\n\nThe Docket has 18,996 tokens. I need to read a window of up to 10,000 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I'll start from the beginning. The first few tokens of the Docket likely contain the filing date. So, I'll use read_document on the Docket, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000.\n\nWait, the document is 18,996 tokens, so reading 0-10,000 is safe. I'll call read_document with doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nNo need for regex search here because the filing date is a specific date, but the Docket is structured with dates. Reading the first part should suffice. If the date isn't there, I can search the Docket later, but starting with the beginning is logical.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3258, "completion_tokens": 429, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Filing_Date\", which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they already read the Docket document from tokens 0-10000. The Docket entry shows multiple entries with dates like 2025-04-03, 2025-04-04, etc. The first entry is \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants\" filed on 4/3/2025. The requirement is to extract every distinct value. So the filing date should be 2025-04-03.\n\nWait, the Docket shows \"Filed on 4/3/2025\" for the Complaint. That's the key document for the filing date. The other entries are motions and notices filed later, but the initial complaint is the filing date. So the Filing_Date should be 2025-04-03.\n\nThe current status says 0 values extracted. The user has read the Docket, which contains the filing date. Now, the next step is to append this value to the checklist. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe verbatim text is \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405, receipt number ACANDC-20530275.). Injunction against the US government/official or APA vacatur requested. Filed by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, ... (Weis, Anne) (Filed on 4/3/2025) (Entered: 04/03/2025)\".\n\nSource document is \"Docket\", location is the specific entry (entry 1 in the Docket). The tokens read were 0-10000, but the exact location in the document can be specified as the entry number or the text snippet.\n\nSo, the extracted value is \"2025-04-03\", and the evidence includes the text snippet showing \"Filed on 4/3/2025\".\n\nNow, check if there are other distinct filing dates. The other entries in the Docket have later dates (4/4, 4/6, etc.), but the initial filing is the Complaint on 4/3/2025. So only one distinct date here.\n\nThe checklist item Filing_Date should have this value. Since it's the first entry, use append_checklist to add it. The evidence must be included as an array of evidence objects with text, source_document, and location.\n\nSo the action is to call append_checklist with the key \"Filing_Date\" and the extracted value. The evidence text is the verbatim part from the Docket, source is \"Docket\", location can be \"Docket entry 1\" or similar.\n\nWait, the location should be specific. The Docket entries are listed with numbers, so entry 1 is the Complaint. The exact location in the document might be the line starting with \"1 | 2025-04-03 | COMPLAINT...\".\n\nBut the tool requires location as a string. Maybe \"Docket entry 1\" or \"Tokens 0-10000, line 1\".\n\nBut the user's instructions say to include \"location (e.g., page, section, docket entry; include token offsets if available)\". Since the document was read from 0-10000, and the entry is in that range, maybe the location is \"Docket entry 1\" or \"Docket entry 1 (tokens 0-10000)\".\n\nBut the evidence location should be as precise as possible. The entry starts with \"1 | 2025-04-03 | COMPLAINT...\", so perhaps \"Docket entry 1\" is sufficient.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have text as the exact line, source \"Docket\", location \"Docket entry 1\".\n\nWait, the text should be the verbatim snippet. The relevant part is \"(Filed on 4/3/2025)\", but the whole entry line might be better. Let's take the entire line for the complaint: \"1 | 2025-04-03 | COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405, receipt number ACANDC-20530275.). Injunction against the US government/official or APA vacatur requested.

(Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet)(Weis, Anne) (Filed on 4/3/2025) (Entered: 04/03/2025)\".\n\nBut the evidence text should be the exact part that states the filing date. The key phrase is \"Filed on 4/3/2025\", so maybe extract that snippet. However, the instructions say to include the verbatim text from the document, so including the entire line might be better for context.\n\nBut the requirement is to have the verbatim snippet. So the evidence text should be the exact string from the document that shows the filing date. The line includes \"(Filed on 4/3/2025)\", so that's the part. But the whole line is part of the document, so including the full line as evidence is acceptable.\n\nSo the evidence text would be the entire line for entry 1.\n\nNow, the action is to append the Filing_Date with this evidence.\n\nCheck if there are other entries. The next entries after that are on 4/4, 4/6, etc., but those are subsequent filings, not the initial filing. The Filing_Date is the date the lawsuit was first filed, which is the Complaint date. So only 2025-04-03.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have key \"Filing_Date\", extracted as a list with one entry containing the value \"2025-04-03\" and the evidence.\n\nWait, the value should be the date in a standard format. The document says \"4/3/2025\", which is April 3, 2025. The expected format is probably YYYY-MM-DD, so \"2025-04-03\".\n\nYes, the example in the Docket uses \"04/03/2025\" in the Entered field, so the value should be \"2025-04-03\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"2025-04-03\".\n\nNow, check if the document has been fully read. The Docket was read up to tokens 0-10000, which covered the first part. The entry 1 is within that range. The Docket document has 18,996 tokens, so 0-10000 is partial, but the entry 1 is in the first 10k tokens.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to append the Filing_Date with the evidence from entry 1 of the Docket.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"2025-04-03\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405, receipt number ACANDC-20530275.).

The task is to extract the filing date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's already been done. The recent actions show that Step 1 was list_documents, which found 5 documents. Step 2 was reading the Docket document from tokens 0-10000. Then Step 3 was appending the Filing_Date with the value \"2025-04-03\" from the Docket entry 1.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: Filing_Date has 1 value extracted. The Docket document is partially visited (viewed 0-10000 out of 18996 tokens, so 53% coverage). The other documents are unvisited. But the checklist item is Filing_Date, which should be the date the lawsuit was first filed. The Docket entry 1 mentions \"Filed on 4/3/2025\", which was extracted as 2025-04-03.\n\nWait, but the user might have more documents that could have the filing date. However, the Complaint document is supposed to be the actual complaint filed, which would have the filing date. The Docket entry 1 is the complaint filing, so maybe the Complaint document also has the date. But the Docket already has the date from the complaint entry.\n\nBut the instructions say to extract every distinct value. So, if the Complaint document has the same date, it's redundant. But maybe there's another document with a different date? Probably not, since the complaint is the first filing.\n\nWait, the Docket is a log of filings. The first entry (entry 1) is the complaint filed on 4/3/2025. The other entries are subsequent filings. So the actual filing date should be 2025-04-03.\n\nBut the Docket is partially read. The viewed tokens are 0-10000, but the Docket is 18996 tokens. However, the relevant entry (entry 1) is within the first 10000 tokens, as seen in the read_document output. So the date has already been extracted from the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 1 is in the read text: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants... Filed by National Nurses Organizing Committee... (Weis, Anne) (Filed on 4/3/2025) (Entered: 04/03/2025)\". So the filing date is 4/3/2025, which is 2025-04-03.\n\nThe checklist item Filing_Date should be extracted from the complaint's filing date. Since the Docket entry 1 is the complaint filing, that's the correct date. The other entries in the Docket are after that, so they have later dates. So the only filing date is 2025-04-03.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value. The question is, are there any other documents that might have the filing date? The Complaint document might have the date, but it's probably the same as the Docket entry. However, the instructions say to extract every distinct value. If the Complaint document also lists the filing date, it's the same value, so no need to add it again. But maybe the Complaint document has a different date? Unlikely.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same date appears in multiple documents, it's still one distinct value. So even if the Complaint document has it, it's the same value, so no need to add another entry.\n\nBut the Docket is the main source for the filing date. The Complaint document might have the date in the header or footer, but since the Docket already captured it, and the value is the same, it's redundant.\n\nThe next step: check if there are any other documents that might have a different filing date. But the other documents are Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, and the Ex Parte Motion. These are subsequent filings, so their dates are after the initial filing. So the only filing date is 2025-04-03.\n\nWait, the Docket is a log of filings, so the first entry (entry 1) is the complaint, which is the filing date. The other entries (like entry 2, 3, etc.) are motions filed after the complaint. So the Docket's entry 1 is the correct one.\n\nSince the Docket has been partially read, but the relevant entry is already in the read portion (tokens 0-10000), there's no need to read more of the Docket. The other documents (Complaint, Order, etc.) are probably not necessary for the filing date, as the Docket already has it.\n\nThe checklist summary shows that Filing_Date is filled with one value. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, there's only one key, which is filled. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", \"Not Applicable: 0/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say to use get_checklist periodically to assess remaining gaps. However, the current status already shows that Filing_Date has a value. The user might have to confirm that there are no other values. But since the Docket entry 1 is the first filing, and other documents are subsequent, there's no other filing date.
