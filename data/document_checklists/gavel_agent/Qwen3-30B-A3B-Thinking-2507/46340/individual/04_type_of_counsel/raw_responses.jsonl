The current status shows 0 values extracted, and all documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain counsel information. The Complaint usually lists the attorneys, and the Docket might have attorney details. The Order and Motions could also mention counsel, but the Complaint is the primary place.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Complaint, Docket, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, and Ex Parte Motion. The Complaint is the most probable source for counsel types. Since it's unvisited, I should read it first. The token count is 28k, which is over 10k, so I need to read a window. The default would be to read the first 10k tokens. But maybe the counsel info is in the beginning, like the attorney names on the cover page.\n\nWait, the document says \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" as [Complaint]. Typically, the complaint starts with the parties and their counsel. So the first few pages (tokens) would have that info. So I'll use read_document on the Complaint, starting at 0, ending at 10000 tokens. That's within the 10k limit. No need for regex here since the info is likely in the beginning.

The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. The user has provided a snapshot of the current status and the documents available.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions: Step 2 was list_documents, which found 5 documents. Step 3 was read_document on the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 0-10000. The response from that read shows the document's content, which includes the plaintiff's attorneys.\n\nIn the document, on page 1, there's a list of attorneys for the Plaintiffs. The firms mentioned are BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C. and FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP. The description says \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs (Additional Counsel on signature page)\". The checklist item Type_of_Counsel requires the type of counsel, like private counsel, public interest nonprofit, etc., with specific organizations in parentheses.\n\nSo, the firms listed here are private law firms. BREDHOFF & KAISER is a private firm, and FEINBERG, JACKSON is also a private firm. The plaintiffs are labor unions (AFGE, AFSCME, etc.), so their counsel is private counsel representing them. The defendants are government agencies, so their counsel would likely be government counsel. But the document provided is the complaint, which is from the plaintiffs' side. The defendants' counsel might be in other documents, but the current read is only the complaint.\n\nWait, the complaint is filed by the plaintiffs, so the attorneys listed are for the plaintiffs. The defendants are the government entities, so their counsel would be government counsel. But the current document (Complaint) only shows the plaintiffs' attorneys. The defendants' counsel might not be listed here; they might be in the answer or other documents.\n\nLooking at the document's text, the attorneys are listed as \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\". So the Type_of_Counsel for the Plaintiffs is private counsel. The specific organizations are BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C. and FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP. So the extracted value should be \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\" and \"Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\".\n\nWait, the checklist says to use brief category labels and include specific organizations in parentheses. So each firm would be a separate entry. The plaintiffs' counsel is private counsel, so the entries would be:\n\n- Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\n- Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\n\nBut the problem is, the document might not specify the type of counsel beyond the firm names. However, since these are law firms, they're private counsel. The defendants are government entities, so their counsel would be government counsel, but that's not in this document. The current document is the complaint, so it's only showing the plaintiffs' side.\n\nWait, the document says \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\", so the counsel for the plaintiffs is private. The defendants' counsel would be the government, so \"Government counsel\" for the defendants. But the document doesn't mention the defendants' counsel; that's probably in the answer or other documents. However, the task is to extract from all documents, but the current read is only the complaint. The other documents (Docket, Order, etc.) might have more info.\n\nBut the user's current action is to process the complaint. The recent read was the complaint, and the text shows the plaintiffs' attorneys. So for Type_of_Counsel, we have two entries for the plaintiffs: the two law firms under private counsel.\n\nThe checklist says to include \"Plaintiff: ...\" and \"Defendant: ...\" if both sides are represented. But in this case, the document only shows the plaintiffs' counsel. The defendants are the government, so their counsel would be government counsel, but it's not in this document. So maybe the Type_of_Counsel for the plaintiffs is private counsel (with the firms), and the defendants' government counsel would need to be found elsewhere.\n\nBut the current document (complaint) only has the plaintiffs' side. So the extracted values from this document would be the private counsel for the plaintiffs. The defendants' counsel might be in other documents, like the Answer or the Docket.\n\nHowever, the current step is to extract from the documents. The next action should be to append the extracted values from the complaint. The evidence would be the text from the document, citing the page and the specific lines.\n\nLooking at the read_document response, the attorneys are listed on page 1, lines 3-9. The text includes \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\" and \"FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP\".\n\nSo the extracted entries should be:\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel:\n- value: \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\"\n- evidence: text snippet from the document (lines 3-9 on page 1), source_document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 1, attorney list\"\n\nSimilarly for the other firm.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each unique value with its supporting evidence\". So each firm is a separate entry under Type_of_Counsel, as they are distinct organizations. But the type is the same (private counsel), so the value would be \"Private counsel (Organization Name)\".\n\nThe task says \"create separate entries for each unique value\". So each firm would be a separate entry. So two entries for Type_of_Counsel from this document.\n\nNow, the current status shows 0 values extracted. So after reading the complaint, we need to append these two entries.\n\nThe next action should be append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nCheck the parameters: append_checklist requires a patch with key and extracted array. Each extracted entry has evidence (text, source_document, location) and value.\n\nSo for key \"Type_of_Counsel\", extracted array has two entries:\n\nFirst entry:\n- value: \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\"\n- evidence: [ { text: \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\", source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"Page 1, attorney list\" } ]\n\nWait, the text is from lines 3-9. The exact text in the document shows:\n\n\"3 \nBREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C. \n4 \n805 Fifteenth Street NW, Suite 1000 \n5  Washington, D.C. 20005 \n...\"\n\nBut the firm name is on line 3. So the text evidence should be the verbatim snippet. The exact line where the firm is mentioned is line 3: \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\".\n\nSimilarly, the other firm is on lines 12-13: \"FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP\".\n\nSo for the first entry, evidence text is \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\" from page 1.\n\nWait, but the location should be specific. The document's page is 1, and the text is in the attorney block. So location could be \"Page 1, attorneys for Plaintiffs\".\n\nSimilarly for the other firm.\n\nSo the append_checklist call should have:\n\npatch: [\n  {\n    key: \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n    extracted: [\n      {\n        value: \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\",\n            source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n            location: \"Page 1, attorney list\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        value: \"Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP\",\n            source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n            location: \"Page 1, attorney list\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context\". So the evidence should include the surrounding text. But the user's instruction says \"evidence\" requires verbatim snippet, source document, location.\n\nThe verbatim snippet can be the firm name as it's mentioned, which is sufficient to identify it. The location is \"Page 1, attorney list\" as the document shows.\n\nSo the append_checklist is the correct next action.\n\nThe current document is partially visited (0-10000), but since we're appending based on the read text, this is the right move.\n\nNo need to read more documents yet; the complaint has the necessary info for the plaintiffs' counsel. The defendants' counsel might be in other documents, but the task is to extract all applicable, and the current document provides two entries for Type_of_Counsel (plaintiffs' side). The defendants' side might require other documents, but the next action should be to append what's found here.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1, attorney list\"}]}, {\"value\": \"Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1, attorney list\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)", "evidence": [{"text": "BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1, attorney list"}]}, {"value": "Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)", "evidence": [{"text": "FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1, attorney list"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14444, "completion_tokens": 2193, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

So far, they've read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document and found two entries: BREDHOFF & KAISER and FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN. The checklist item is Type_of_Counsel, which should list the type of counsel for each side.\n\nWait, the instructions say to extract each side separately as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. But in the complaint, the attorneys listed are for the Plaintiffs, right? The document says \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs (Additional Counsel on signature page)\". So both firms are representing the Plaintiffs. The Defendants are the government agencies, so their counsel might be different.\n\nLooking at the current extracted values, they have \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\" and \"Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\". But the Defendants aren't mentioned here. The complaint is from the Plaintiffs, so the Defendants' counsel might be in another document, like the Docket or Orders.\n\nThe available documents are Complaint (partially read), Docket (unvisited), Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, and Ex Parte Motion. The Docket might list the attorneys for both sides. The current status shows 2 values from the Complaint, but maybe there's more in other documents.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are more entries. The Complaint's first 10k tokens only show Plaintiffs' counsel. The Defendants are government agencies, so their counsel might be listed in the Docket or another document. Since the Docket is unvisited, I should read that to find Defendant's counsel.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". So I need to check if there's Defendant counsel listed anywhere. The current extraction only has Plaintiffs. So I need to look for Defendant's counsel in other documents.\n\nThe next action should be to read the Docket document, which is unvisited. The Docket might have the Defendant's attorneys. The Document Catalog shows Docket as 18,996 tokens, unvisited, so I should use read_document on it. But since it's unvisited, start from 0-10k tokens first. Wait, the max is 10k tokens per read. So call read_document on Docket, tokens 0-10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to find \"Defendant\" or \"counsel\" in the Docket. But the instructions say to first read the document if likely to contain the info. The Docket is a common place to list counsel for both sides. So reading the Docket's first 10k tokens makes sense.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for Docket, start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14635, "completion_tokens": 687, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. They've already done some steps: listed documents, read the Complaint, appended two values, then read the Docket.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have two values for Type_of_Counsel from the Complaint. The Docket document was read (tokens 0-10000), but the evidence from the Docket doesn't seem to add any new Type_of_Counsel entries. The Docket mentions attorneys like Catha Worthman, Daniel Feinberg, etc., but the type of counsel is already covered in the Complaint. The \"Private counsel\" entries are from the law firms listed there.\n\nWait, the Docket has entries like \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Catha Alison Worthman on behalf of American Federation Of Government Employees...\" but the counsel type is still private counsel, same as before. So no new Type_of_Counsel values are found in the Docket. The existing two values are already captured.\n\nThe available documents show that Complaint and Docket are partially visited (35% and 53% covered), but the other documents (Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion) are unvisited. However, the checklist item Type_of_Counsel is about the type of counsel representing sides. The Complaint already lists the law firms, and the Docket's notices of appearance don't introduce new counsel types—they're just confirming the existing private counsel.\n\nThe user needs to check if any other documents might have different counsel types. But the current checklist item is only about Type_of_Counsel, and the existing entries are \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\" and \"Private counsel (FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP)\". The other documents (like the Order or Motion) are likely court orders or motions, which wouldn't list the counsel types again. The Docket's notices of appearance are just confirming the attorneys, not changing the type.\n\nSince the Type_of_Counsel is already fully extracted (only private counsel is present, no government or pro se mentioned), and the other documents probably don't add new values, the next step is to check if all values are covered. The current status shows 2 values extracted, which matches what's in the Complaint. The Docket didn't add anything new.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading the Docket (tokens 0-10000), but the evidence from that doesn't yield new Type_of_Counsel entries. So after reading the Docket, there's no new value to append. The checklist summary says 1 key with 2 values, and no empty keys. So maybe they should stop now.\n\nBut let's confirm: the checklist requires every distinct value. The Complaint has two law firms, both private counsel. The Docket's notices don't mention any other counsel types. The other documents (Order, etc.) are probably not relevant for counsel types. So all applicable values are extracted. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, the system says to use get_checklist to verify before stopping. But the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the Type_of_Counsel is filled. The checklist summary shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, it's time to stop.\n\nBut the instructions say to stop only when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key is complete with two values. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's last action was reading the Docket, and after that, they need to either append or update. But the Docket didn't add any new values, so no append needed.

The Docket document was read but didn't add new counsel types.
