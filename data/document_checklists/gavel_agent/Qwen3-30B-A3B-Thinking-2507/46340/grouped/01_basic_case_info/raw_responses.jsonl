The user needs to extract four checklist items from legal case documents. But looking at the current status, there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. The system hasn't found any documents, so I can't read or search anything without knowing what's there. \n\nThe user's next action options include `list_documents` as the first step. All other actions like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct move here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. That's the only logical step before proceeding further. No other actions make sense without knowing the documents present. So the next tool call should be `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3322, "completion_tokens": 229, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract four specific items from legal documents, and currently, all are empty. The available documents are all unvisited, so the first step is to figure out which document to read first.\n\nLooking at the checklist items: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, and Type_of_Counsel. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Complaint) is the most likely place to find the Filing_Date and the parties involved. The Docket might have the filing date, but the Complaint is usually where the case starts, so the filing date is probably there. The parties' descriptions would also be in the Complaint's beginning.\n\nThe other documents like the Order or Motions might have later dates or details, but the initial filing date and parties should be in the Complaint. So, the best first move is to read the Complaint document. Since it's unvisited, I should call read_document on it. The token count is 28k, but the maximum per call is 10k, so I'll start from the beginning. The start_token should be 0, end_token 10000. That's within the limit and will cover the front part where the filing date and parties are typically listed.\n\nWait, the user mentioned not to reread visited documents, but this one is unvisited, so it's safe. The Docket might have the filing date too, but the Complaint is more direct. Let's go with reading the Complaint first. So the action is read_document with doc_name \"Complaint\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3489, "completion_tokens": 406, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract four specific checklist items from legal case documents. The snapshot shows I've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document, but the keys are all empty so far.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text, I notice the first page has the filing date: \"Filed 04/03/25\" on page 1. That's clearly the Filing_Date. The format matches the requirement (calendar date), so I can extract that.\n\nFor Who_are_the_Parties, the document lists all plaintiffs and defendants. The plaintiffs are clearly identified as \"AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO; AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO; etc.\" and defendants as \"DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States; U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT; etc.\" I'll need to format these as \"Plaintiff: [description]\" and \"Defendant: [description]\" per the checklist.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: The complaint states \"Plaintiffs\" multiple times and describes them as unions representing members. The text says \"Plaintiff Unions\" and mentions they're bringing the action \"on behalf of themselves as organizations and on behalf of their members.\" This indicates a class action, so I'll format as \"Plaintiffs: Class Action.\"\n\nType_of_Counsel: The attorney list shows \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\" and \"FEINBERG, JACKSON, WORTHMAN & WASOW, LLP\" as counsel. The descriptions don't specify categories like \"public interest organization\" but the firms are private law firms. So I'll note \"Private Counsel\" for both.\n\nWait, the checklist says Type_of_Counsel should be categories like \"private counsel, legal services, etc.\" Since these are private law firms, \"Private Counsel\" is appropriate. I'll need to create evidence entries for each with the exact text snippets.\n\nI should use append_checklist since I'm adding new values. Each extracted item needs evidence with text snippet, source document, and location. For Filing_Date, the evidence is \"Filed 04/03/25\" on page 1. For parties, I'll take the list from the complaint. For class action, the phrase \"Plaintiff Unions\" and \"on behalf of their members\" supports it. For counsel, the firm names indicate private counsel.\n\nI need to be careful not to miss any values. The complaint has multiple plaintiff unions and defendant agencies, but the checklist only asks for descriptions, not each individual. So one entry per role (plaintiff group, defendant group) should suffice.\n\nNo Not Applicable here since all items have clear evidence.

The checklist items are Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, and Type_of_Counsel. The recent actions show that all four were appended with evidence from the Complaint document. The Filing_Date has \"04/03/25\" from the document header.
