The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the first function to call here is list_documents. There's no need to read or search any documents yet because there are none to read. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system needs to discover them first.

The task is to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the provided documents. The user has already listed 8 documents, all unvisited. The checklist item requires the duration of settlement obligations that aren't part of a court order.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain settlement terms. Settlements are usually in pleadings, motions, or agreements. Looking at the documents:\n\n- Complaints (First Amended, Complaint) typically outline claims but might not have settlement terms unless it's a settlement agreement.\n- Docket might list case events but not detailed settlement durations.\n- Orders (like TRO, Preliminary Injunction) are court orders, so settlement terms incorporated into orders shouldn't be included per the checklist definition.\n- Motions (Defendants' Motion for Stay, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, Notice of Motion for TRO) could have settlement discussions, but motions are usually arguments, not settlements.\n- The Notice of Motion for TRO mentions a \"Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order,\" which is an emergency order, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies \"settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\" So the settlement terms would be in a separate agreement, maybe a settlement agreement document. But the available documents don't include a settlement agreement. The user provided 8 documents, none of which seem to be a settlement agreement. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction and others are motions, not settlements.\n\nHmm, maybe the settlement terms are mentioned in the pleadings or motions. For example, sometimes parties might reference a settlement in a motion. But the key is that the settlement duration must be a separate obligation, not part of a court order. If the settlement is part of a court order (like a consent decree), then it's excluded.\n\nSince none of the documents listed are settlement agreements, maybe the item is Not Applicable. But I shouldn't assume that yet. I need to check the documents to confirm.\n\nThe next step is to search for possible settlement terms. The checklist says to extract \"duration of settlement obligations,\" so the key phrase might be something like \"settlement period,\" \"duration,\" \"monitoring period,\" etc. But the exact wording could vary.\n\nGiven that all documents are unvisited, the first action should be to search for the term \"settlement\" or \"settlement period\" across all documents. Using `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"settlement\\s+duration|settlement period|monitoring period\" might find relevant sections. The regex should be anchored to avoid false positives.\n\nWait, the document names include \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" and \"Notice of Motion...\" which might discuss settlements. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction could mention a proposed settlement. Let's consider that.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. So, I'll set up a regex to search for terms related to settlement duration. The pattern could be something like r\"settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|monitoring\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement\".\n\nUsing `search_document_regex` with doc_name='all' and that pattern. Top_k=5, context_tokens=200. This will return matches from all documents with context, so I can then check if any of those matches contain the actual duration.\n\nWait, the user said \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order.\" So if a document mentions a settlement duration but it's part of a court order (like in an order document), then it shouldn't be included. But the order documents (like TRO, Preliminary Injunction) might not have settlement terms. The settlement terms would likely be in the pleadings or motions.\n\nSo, searching all documents for the regex pattern is the right first step. Then, from the search results, I can check each match to see if the duration is mentioned and if it's not part of a court order.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be `search_document_regex` with the appropriate pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"settlement\\\\s+duration|settlement\\\\s+period|monitoring\\\\s+period|duration\\\\s+of\\\\s+settlement\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|monitoring\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3447, "completion_tokens": 932, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\". The recent actions show that a regex search was done for terms like \"settlement duration\" etc., but it found zero matches. Now, the task is to figure out the next step.\n\nFirst, the available documents are all unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited). The regex search didn't find anything, so maybe the terms used weren't specific enough. The pattern was \"settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|monitoring\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement\". Maybe the actual documents use different phrasing. For example, they might say \"settlement terms\" or \"duration of the settlement\" without using \"period\" or \"duration\" in that exact way.\n\nSince the regex search didn't yield results, the next logical step is to read some documents to look for the information manually. But which document to start with? The most relevant ones might be the Complaints, Amended Complaints, or Motions related to settlement. The Docket might have some mentions, but it's less likely. The Orders might reference settlements if they're part of a court order.\n\nThe user's checklist specifies that only settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order should be included. So if the Orders or Judgments mention a settlement, those might be excluded. But the regex search didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't there. But perhaps the actual text uses different wording.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I should pick a document to read. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction (28k tokens) is a long document, but maybe it's the most relevant. Alternatively, the Complaints might mention settlement terms. Let's start with the First Amended Complaint, as it's a key document in the case.\n\nWait, the system says not to read more than 10k tokens per call. The First Amended Complaint is 13,733 tokens, so I can read the first 10k tokens. But maybe start with a smaller document. The Complaint For Declaratory Relief is 8,880 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. That might be efficient.\n\nBut the user's goal is to find settlement duration. The Complaint might not have it, but the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction could. Hmm. Alternatively, the Docket might list settlement terms, but it's a docket, so probably not. The Orders might have settlement terms if they're part of the order, but the checklist says to exclude those incorporated into court orders. So maybe the Orders are not the right place.\n\nWait, the regex search didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't there. But the user needs to check the documents. Since the regex failed, reading a document is the next step. The safest first step is to read the Complaint, as it's a primary document. Let's choose \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and read the entire document since it's under 10k tokens (8,880). That way, I can check all the text without needing multiple reads.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for that document with start_token 0 and end_token 8880. That's the whole document. Then, after reading, analyze the text for any mention of settlement duration. If found, append to the checklist. If not, proceed to the next document.\n\nWait, but the system says not to reread documents, but since it's unvisited, it's okay. The document is marked as ○ Unvisited, so reading it is the right move. The regex search didn't find anything, so manual reading is needed. So the correct action here is to call read_document on the Complaint document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8880}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8880}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3502, "completion_tokens": 863, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of settlement obligations in negotiated agreements, not court orders.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current status. The user mentioned that after searching all documents with a regex for settlement duration terms, there were 0 matches. Then they read the Complaint document, which is fully visited (tokens 0-8880), and found no relevant information. The complaint is about SEVIS terminations, not settlements, so it makes sense there's no settlement duration mentioned.\n\nNow, checking the available documents. The Complaint is fully visited, but there are seven other documents unvisited: First Amended Complaint, Docket, Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order, Order Granting Preliminary Injunctions, Defendants' Motion for Stay, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, and Notice of Motion for TRO. Since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe the settlement duration is in one of these other documents.\n\nThe next logical step is to check if any of the unvisited documents might contain settlement terms. The Order Granting Preliminary Injunctions and the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction might have settlement details. The \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" (28,869 tokens) is the longest document, so it's a good candidate to read next. Alternatively, the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" could have settlement terms.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited documents. The Complaint is done, so I should pick an unvisited document. Since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe the settlement terms are in a specific document. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction seems likely to contain settlement details if there's any.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies that settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order. The documents like the Order Granting Injunctions might have settlement terms, but the complaint itself is about a lawsuit, not a settlement. The user needs to find if there's a settlement agreement mentioned, not the lawsuit details.\n\nGiven that the regex search on all documents returned 0 matches, maybe the term is phrased differently. But the next step after a failed regex search is to read other documents. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction is a pleading that might include settlement terms if the parties are negotiating.\n\nI should choose to read the \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" document. It's unvisited and has a high token count, so it's likely to contain relevant info. The token range should be 0-10000 to stay within the limit. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the first 10,000 tokens of that document.\n\nWait, the available documents list it as 28,869 tokens, so reading 0-10000 is safe. The other documents like the Docket might have brief info, but the motion is more likely to have detailed settlement terms. So the next action is read_document on \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" from tokens 0 to 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13296, "completion_tokens": 727, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've already done a regex search across all 8 documents for terms like \"settlement duration\" but found 0 matches. Then they read the Complaint and the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction. The Complaint (first document) is fully visited, and the Motion is partially read up to 10,000 tokens.\n\nIn the Complaint, they read through page 14, but it's a complaint about SEVIS terminations, not a settlement. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction talks about visa revocations and SEVIS status, but again, no mention of a settlement duration. The document mentions \"restored\" SEVIS status, but that's part of the legal remedy, not a settlement duration.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the checklist item specifies \"settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The documents they've read so far are complaints and motions, which are part of the lawsuit, not the actual settlement agreement. The settlement duration would likely be in a settlement agreement or a consent decree, but the available documents don't include those. The documents listed are all related to the lawsuit (complaints, motions, orders), but not the settlement terms.\n\nThe user has checked the first two documents (Complaint fully visited, Motion partially visited). The other documents are unvisited: First Amended Complaint, Docket, Ex Parte Order, Order Granting Injunctions, Defendants' Motion, and Notice of Motion. But the regex search didn't find any matches, and the two documents they read don't contain the required info.\n\nThe problem is that the settlement duration might not be in these documents. The checklist item says to extract it only if it's a settlement obligation not in a court order. Since the case is ongoing (they're seeking a preliminary injunction), there's no settlement yet. The documents are about the lawsuit, not a settlement. So the correct action is to mark this as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user must provide evidence. The Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry with \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence. The evidence should be a clear statement that the settlement hasn't occurred, or the case is ongoing without a settlement.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction mentions that SEVIS statuses have been restored under the preliminary injunction, but there's no settlement. The case is still active, so no settlement agreement exists. The complaint is about seeking relief, not resolving via settlement. Therefore, the settlement duration doesn't apply here.\n\nSo the next step is to use update_checklist to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" to Not Applicable with evidence from the documents. The evidence could be from the Motion document, which states that the preliminary injunction is in place, implying no settlement has been reached yet. For example, in the Motion, they mention \"the visas remain revoked\" and \"this initial lawsuit\" which suggests the case is ongoing, so no settlement.\n\nWait, the Motion says \"As a result of this lawsuit, and as required by the currently existing preliminary injunction, all SEVIS statuses have been restored.\" So the case is still ongoing, and there's no settlement agreement. Therefore, the settlement duration is not applicable because there's no settlement yet.\n\nSo the correct action is to use update_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" and set it to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Motion document. The evidence should be a quote from the Motion indicating the case is ongoing without a settlement.\n\nCheck the Motion text: \"As a result of this lawsuit, and as required by the currently existing preliminary injunction, all SEVIS statuses have been restored.\" This implies that the case is still active, no settlement has been reached, so the settlement duration doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be update_checklist with the key and the Not Applicable entry.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"As a result of this lawsuit, and as required by the currently existing preliminary injunction, all SEVIS statuses have been restored.\", \"source_document\": \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\", \"location\": \"Page 3, Paragraph 17\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "As a result of this lawsuit, and as required by the currently existing preliminary injunction, all SEVIS statuses have been restored.", "source_document": "Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 3, Paragraph 17"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24220, "completion_tokens": 961, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
