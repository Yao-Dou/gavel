SEVIS is a web-based system used by DHS to track and monitor information about nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors in the United States. Termination of their SEVIS records results in irreparable harm and causes a nationwide impact, as the affected students are required to leave the country immediately. They have to abruptly suspend their studies (one of the Plaintiffs is a month away from graduation), end housing arrangements or leases, lose employment authorization, face virtually insurmountable bars when re-entering the U.S. if they depart, and if they have any dependents, their dependents\u2019 status is also terminated."

Despite his consistent compliance with immigration and academic regulations, Mr. Ouyang\u2019s SEVIS record was abruptly terminated in April 2025. According to the University of Cincinnati\u2019s international office, the termination was based on the previously dismissed arrest."
