The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet.

The user needs the Filing_Date extracted from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all keys are empty, and there are 8 unvisited documents. The task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to find where the filing date is mentioned. Typically, in legal documents like a Complaint, the filing date is on the front page or in the caption.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"First Amended Complaint\". The original Complaint is likely to have the filing date, since amended complaints are later versions. The Docket might also list the filing date, as dockets often have the initial filing date.\n\nSince the documents are unvisited, I should start by reading the first document. The Complaint is the most probable place for the filing date. The document is 8,880 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a read_document call. I'll read the entire document since it's unvisited, but maybe the date is near the beginning.\n\nWait, the Decision Policy says to avoid rereading, but since it's unvisited, it's okay. The user said to use read_document as the default. So I'll call read_document on the Complaint document. Start at token 0, end at 8880. That should get the whole thing. Then, after reading, I can look for the date in the text.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to find \"Filed:\" or \"Filing Date\" patterns. But the instructions say to use read_document as default unless it's clearly patternable. Since the filing date might be in a specific format, maybe a regex search could help. But the Complaint is the primary document to check first. Let's go with read_document on the Complaint to get the full text and then parse it for the date.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8880}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8880}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3388, "completion_tokens": 460, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The snapshot shows they've already read the Complaint document (tokens 0-8880) and found a clear \"Filed 04/11/25\" in the header.\n\nHmm, the key detail here is that the document shows \"Filed 04/11/25\" on page 1. The date format is MM/DD/YY, so 04/11/25 means April 11, 2025. This is the filing date since it's the first document in the case (Document 1). \n\nI should verify if there are other documents that might have different filing dates, but the Complaint is the initial filing. The other documents like Amended Complaint or Motions would have later dates. The checklist specifically asks for the \"first filed\" date, so only the Complaint's date matters here.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to extract EVERY distinct value. But since this is the initial filing, there's only one value to extract. The other documents are amendments or motions filed later, so they don't count as the \"filing date\" per the definition.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim snippet. The exact text is \"Filed 04/11/25\" in the document header. Source is \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location is \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI Document 1 Filed 04/11/25 Page 1 of 14\".\n\nI should use append_checklist because it's adding a new entry. The value is \"04/11/25\" but wait—the requirement says \"calendar date\", so it should be written as April 11, 2025? But the document uses MM/DD/YY. The instructions don't specify formatting, so I'll use the exact string from the document: \"04/11/25\". \n\nDouble-checking the evidence: the text is verbatim from the header, source document matches, location is correctly cited as page 1. No need for Not Applicable here since the value is clearly present.\n\nThe current status shows Filing_Date is empty, and I've found the value. So next step is to append this single entry. No other documents need to be checked for this key since the Complaint is the initial filing.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"04/11/25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI     Document 1     Filed 04/11/25     Page 1 of 14\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Header, Page 1\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "04/11/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI     Document 1     Filed 04/11/25     Page 1 of 14", "source_document": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Header, Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13182, "completion_tokens": 642, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents, and I'm at Step 4 of the process. \n\nFirst, looking at the current status: the checklist has one item (Filing_Date) and it's already been extracted from the Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief document. The evidence shows \"Filed 04/11/25\" in the header of Document 1. The document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again.\n\nThe other documents are all unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the task is to extract the filing date. The filing date should be in the initial complaint document, which we've already processed. The other documents like Amended Complaint or Docket might have different dates, but the checklist specifically asks for \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court\" – that's the original filing date, not any amendments.\n\nChecking the evidence: the Complaint's header clearly states \"Filed 04/11/25\" on Page 1. Since this is the first document (Document 1) and it's the complaint itself, this is almost certainly the filing date. The other documents (like Amended Complaint) would have later dates, which don't count for the initial filing.\n\nThe checklist summary shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" – meaning the only required item is already filled. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Since Filing_Date is complete with evidence, and there are no other keys to extract, I should stop.\n\nI need to confirm there's no possibility of multiple filing dates. The task says \"every distinct value\" but for filing date, there's only one initial date. The other documents might have filing dates for amendments, but those aren't the original filing. The checklist definition specifies \"first filed/initiated,\" so only the original complaint's date matters.\n\nAlso, the document catalog shows 8 documents, but we've already processed the only one that matters for this item. No need to read others. The \"Not Applicable\" section doesn't apply here since we have a value.\n\nSo the next action is to stop, with a reason that the Filing_Date is fully extracted from the initial complaint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date is fully extracted from Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Document 1) with evidence 'Filed 04/11/25' in header.

Then Step 3 was append_checklist, adding Filing_Date with \"04/11/25\" as the value. Step 4 was stop, but the system automatically did a get_checklist after that.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date is filled with 1 value, and all other keys (there's only one checklist item) are complete. The available documents include others, but the filing date is typically in the initial complaint. The system says \"All checklist items are complete with evidence.
