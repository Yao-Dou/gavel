Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and all documents are unvisited. The task is to find every distinct value of counsel type, formatted correctly.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where to look. The documents include complaints, dockets, motions, and orders. The Type_of_Counsel is likely mentioned in the complaint or the pleadings, especially where parties are listed with their attorneys.\n\nThe user mentioned that if both sides have counsel, they need separate entries like 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. So I need to check documents where the parties are identified with their counsel.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaints (First Amended Complaint, Complaint) are the most likely places to find this info. The Docket might list counsel names, but the complaint usually has the initial representation. The motions and orders might mention counsel as well, but the complaint is primary.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I should start with the main complaint. The first document is \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with 8,880 tokens. Since it's unvisited, reading it would be a good first step. The token count is under 10k, so reading the whole document is possible in one go.\n\nWait, the maximum token range is 10k, and this document is 8,880, so start_token 0 to end_token 8880. That's safe. No need for regex here because the counsel type should be in the body, not a specific pattern like a case number. So using read_document on the first complaint makes sense.\n\nI should check if there's a regex pattern that could help, but the requirement says to use search_document_regex only for clearly patternable items. Type_of_Counsel isn't a pattern; it's a descriptive text. So better to read the document directly.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint document, starting at 0 to 8880 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8880}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8880}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3473, "completion_tokens": 481, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract \"Type_of_Counsel\" from legal documents, specifically looking for the type of counsel representing each side (Plaintiff/Defendant) with evidence.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The snapshot shows only one checklist item: Type_of_Counsel, which is completely empty (0 values extracted). The available documents include a fully visited Complaint (8,880 tokens) and 7 unvisited documents. The recent action was reading the Complaint's full text.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text, I see the attorneys' section on page 1:\n\"Attorneys for Plaintiffs \nZhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, \nJiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\"\n\nAnd the signature block lists:\n\"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\n[sig] Andre Y. Bates\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs\"\n\nSo the plaintiff's counsel is clearly \"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\". The defendants' side isn't specified in the Complaint - no attorneys listed for defendants. The document says \"Defendants\" but doesn't name counsel.\n\nAccording to the checklist rules: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" Since defendants' counsel isn't mentioned, I shouldn't create a \"Defendant: [type]\" entry.\n\nThe instruction says to use \"brief category labels\" like \"private counsel\" and include specific organizations. DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC is a private law firm, so the type is \"private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\".\n\nNow, for evidence:\n- Text: \"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\" from the attorney block\n- Source: \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- Location: Page 1, attorney block (tokens 0-8880 covers this)\n\nI need to use append_checklist since this is a new value. The key is Type_of_Counsel, and the value should be formatted as \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\" per the requirement to separate sides.\n\nWait - the checklist says \"If both sides are represented, extract each as separate values formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". Here only plaintiff counsel is present, so only \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\" should be added.\n\nI'll structure the evidence properly with:\n- value: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\"\n- evidence: [text snippet, source, location]\n\nThe text snippet should be verbatim from the document. Looking at the complaint, the exact line is:\n\"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\"\n\nBut to show context, I'll include the surrounding lines as per evidence requirements.\n\nThe location can be \"Page 1, attorney block\" since token positions are fully covered.\n\nI won't use update_checklist because this is a new entry, not replacing an existing one. And I shouldn't set Not Applicable since we have a valid plaintiff counsel entry.\n\nSo the next action must be append_checklist with this single entry. The document is fully visited, so no need to read more from it. Other documents might have more info, but since we have at least one valid entry from the Complaint, we should extract it now.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1, attorney block (tokens 0-8880)\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)", "evidence": [{"text": "DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC", "source_document": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1, attorney block (tokens 0-8880)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13267, "completion_tokens": 842, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. So far, in Step 3, they've already appended one value from the Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The value is \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\" with evidence from the attorney block on page 1.\n\nNow, the current status shows that there's 1 key with 1 value, and all other keys are empty. But wait, the checklist item is Type_of_Counsel, and they mentioned that if both sides are represented, they should have entries for Plaintiff and Defendant. In the complaint, the defendant is the government (Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons in their official capacities), so their counsel might be government counsel.\n\nThe document catalog shows that there are other documents unvisited: First Amended Complaint, Docket, Orders, Motions, etc. The current read was only the Complaint, which has the plaintiff's counsel. The defendants might have their own counsel mentioned in other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket might have information about the defendants' counsel. The Docket entry usually lists the parties and their attorneys. Also, the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" might mention the government attorneys.\n\nSince the current extraction only has the plaintiff's counsel, I need to check if the defendant's counsel is mentioned anywhere. The defendants are government officials, so their counsel is likely government counsel, possibly from the Department of Justice.\n\nThe next step should be to read the Docket document, which is unvisited, to see if it lists the defendants' attorneys. The Docket might have a section where the parties are listed with their counsel. Alternatively, the Defendants' Motion might have the government counsel's name.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to avoid rereading documents that are fully visited. The Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), but the Docket is unvisited (○ Unvisited). So, I should use read_document on the Docket to check for defendant counsel.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" So for defendant, it should be \"Defendant: government counsel\" or whatever the specific type is.\n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiff's counsel is private (DEHENG), but the defendants are government officials, so their counsel would be government counsel. The Docket might confirm that. For example, in the Docket, it might say \"US Department of Justice\" as the attorney for defendants.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Docket document (Docket) to check for defendant counsel. The Docket is 9,260 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is possible. But the user said to read only unviewed ranges, and since it's unvisited, read the entire document.\n\nWait, the document catalog says \"Docket [Docket] - 9,260 tokens - ○ Unvisited\", so no tokens viewed yet. So, read_document on Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 9260.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket is a short document, but the token count is 9,260, so reading all of it is okay.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call read_document on the Docket document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 9260}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 9260}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13390, "completion_tokens": 762, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from legal documents, and I need to follow strict protocols.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The checklist has one item: Type_of_Counsel. So far, they've extracted one value from the Complaint document: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC)\". \n\nNow, looking at the available documents. The Complaint and Docket are already fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The other six documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). But the user's task is specifically about \"Type_of_Counsel\", which refers to counsel representing each side. \n\nWait, in the Complaint, they only saw the plaintiff's counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC). But the defendants (Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons) also have counsel - Elizabeth D. Kurlan appears in the Docket entries as representing them. \n\nLet me verify that. In the Docket, entry #10 says: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Elizabeth D. Kurlan on behalf of Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". And later entries show her as the attorney for defendants. \n\nSo the defendant's counsel is \"Elizabeth D. Kurlan\" representing the government (since defendants are government officials). The checklist requires separate entries for each side. The plaintiff's counsel was already extracted, but defendant's counsel hasn't been captured yet. \n\nSince the Docket document is already fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), I shouldn't read it again. But wait - the Docket was read in Step 4, and they didn't extract the defendant's counsel from it. Hmm, but the system says: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\". So I can't read Docket again. \n\nBut the extraction process requires evidence. The Docket entry #10 explicitly states \"Elizabeth D. Kurlan on behalf of Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". That's clear evidence for defendant counsel. \n\nWait, but they already read the Docket (tokens 0-9260) in Step 4. The evidence should have been extracted then. Why wasn't it? Maybe they missed it. But per the rules, I can't reread the document. \n\nAh, but the system says: \"After each append_checklist or update_checklist action, verify whether all extractable values from the preceding text were included.\" So I should have caught this during Step 4. \n\nSince the Docket was fully read and the defendant counsel is clearly stated there, I need to add it now. But I can't reread the document. So I must use append_checklist to add this value based on the already-read Docket. \n\nThe evidence would be from Docket entry #10: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Elizabeth D. Kurlan on behalf of Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". \n\nSo for Type_of_Counsel, I need two values:\n1. Plaintiff: private counsel (DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC) - already extracted\n2. Defendant: government counsel (Elizabeth D. Kurlan) - needs to be added\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nSo \"Defendant: government counsel (Elizabeth D. Kurlan)\" would be the second entry.\n\nI should use append_checklist to add this new value. The evidence must include:\n- text: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Elizabeth D. Kurlan on behalf of Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\"\n- source_document: \"Docket\"\n- location: \"Docket entry #10\"\n\nNo need for Not Applicable here since both sides have counsel. \n\nI should check if any other documents might have more counsel info, but the current task is only about Type_of_Counsel. The other documents are unvisited, but since the defendant counsel is already in the Docket (which was fully read), there's no need to read more documents. \n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the new defendant counsel entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Defendant: government counsel (Elizabeth D.

The first two documents (Complaint and Docket) are fully visited. The rest are unvisited, but the checklist only has one key (Type_of_Counsel), and they've already extracted all possible values from the visited documents. The other documents might not have more counsel information. For example, the \"First Amended Complaint\" might have similar attorney info, but since the original complaint already listed the plaintiff's counsel, and the Docket listed the defendant's, it's unlikely there's more to extract. The problem says to extract every distinct value found in any document, but since the two sides are already covered, and no other documents have been read, maybe they're done.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are filled. The empty keys and Not Applicable are zero. So all required values are extracted. The next step should be to check if there's any missing value.

However, in this case, they've already extracted both sides. The plaintiff's counsel is DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC, and defendant's is Elizabeth D. Kurlan, who's a government counsel. The Docket entry #10 says \"Elizabeth D. Kurlan on behalf of Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\", which is government counsel since the defendants are government officials.

However, the documents listed as unvisited include things like \"First Amended Complaint\" and \"Order Granting Motions...\", which might have attorney info.\n\nWait, the Complaint (first document) already listed \"DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\" as plaintiff's counsel.

But to be thorough, should they check?\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents (marked with ✓ Fully Visited).\" The unvisited documents are marked as ○ Unvisited, so they haven't been read yet.
