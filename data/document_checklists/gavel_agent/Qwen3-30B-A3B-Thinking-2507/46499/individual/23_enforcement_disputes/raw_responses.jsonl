The user needs to find all disputes related to enforcing a settlement, specifically excluding disputes over decrees. The checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", and it's currently empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The available documents include complaints, dockets, orders, and motions. Since the checklist is about enforcement disputes, motions and orders might be the best places to look. The \"Docket\" document is a good candidate because dockets often list all filed motions and their statuses.\n\nThe user mentioned that settlements (not court orders) are the focus. So I should look for terms like \"enforce settlement,\" \"motion to enforce,\" \"contempt for settlement,\" etc. But the exact wording might vary. The \"Docket\" document probably lists all motions filed, so checking that first makes sense.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Docket is unvisited and has 9,260 tokens. Since it's the first step, reading the entire document might be too much, but the task allows up to 10,000 tokens. Wait, the Docket is 9,260 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. But maybe I should use search_document_regex to find specific patterns instead of reading the whole thing. However, the Docket might have a structured list of entries, so searching for \"settlement enforcement\" or similar terms could be efficient.\n\nWait, the user's decision policy says: if a specific document likely contains the target value, use read_document as default. The Docket is the most likely to have a list of motions, including enforcement disputes. So reading the Docket document makes sense. But since the Docket is 9,260 tokens, which is under 10k, I can read the entire document with read_document. Alternatively, using search_document_regex might be faster to find the relevant parts. But the policy says to use read_document unless the target is clearly patternable. Here, the target is a specific type of dispute, so maybe searching for keywords is better.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting each dispute as a separate value with date, movant, issue, outcome. So the Docket might have entries like \"Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce Settlement, filed on [date], granted/denied.\" So searching for \"enforce settlement\" or \"motion to enforce\" in the Docket could yield the needed info.\n\nBut the user's tools: search_document_regex can search for regex patterns. Let's consider the regex pattern. The key terms would be \"enforce settlement\" but need to be precise. Maybe \"enforce[^\\s]* settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\". But the exact terms might vary. However, the Docket is the most relevant document here. So using search_document_regex on the Docket document with a pattern like \"enforce.*settlement\" could find the relevant entries.\n\nWait, the document catalog says all are unvisited. So first, I should use search_document_regex on the Docket document (doc_name: \"Docket\") with a pattern that matches the dispute terms. The pattern should be specific to avoid false positives. For example, \"enforce.*settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\". But the regex should be anchored to common phrases. Let's go with \"enforce settlement\" as the pattern, but maybe include variations like \"motion to enforce settlement\".\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to use precise, anchored patterns. So maybe \"motion to enforce settlement\" or \"enforcement of settlement\". Let's use \"enforce.*settlement\" as the pattern. The flags can be IGNORECASE since case might vary.\n\nSo the action would be search_document_regex with doc_name: \"Docket\", pattern: \"enforce.*settlement\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]. This should find any mentions of enforcement related to settlement in the Docket.\n\nAlternatively, since the Docket is the main place where such motions would be listed, searching it makes sense. If that doesn't yield results, then read the entire Docket. But the first step should be to search for the pattern to get context.\n\nWait, the current status shows all keys are empty, and the Docket is the most relevant. So using search_document_regex on Docket with the pattern is the way to go. That's more efficient than reading the whole document first. So the next action is to call search_document_regex on the Docket document with the appropriate pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"enforce.*settlement\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "enforce.*settlement", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3465, "completion_tokens": 993, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Maybe the Docket has the info, but the pattern wasn't right. The previous search used \"enforce.*settlement\", but maybe the actual terms are different. Like, maybe it's \"enforce settlement\" without the period, or \"settlement enforcement\". Or maybe the disputes are mentioned in other documents, not the Docket.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is one of them. The other documents are complaints, motions, orders. The Docket might have entries about motions to enforce settlements. But the regex didn't find anything. Maybe the pattern needs to be adjusted. Wait, the user's previous search used \"enforce.*settlement\" which might be too specific. Maybe the correct term is \"enforce settlement\" without the asterisk, or perhaps \"settlement enforcement\". Let me check the regex pattern again.\n\nThe regex \"enforce.*settlement\" would look for \"enforce\" followed by any characters then \"settlement\". But maybe the actual text uses \"settlement enforcement\" or \"enforce settlement\" as separate words. For example, \"motion to enforce settlement\" instead of \"enforce settlement\". So the pattern might not have matched.\n\nSince the Docket is the most likely place to have such entries (as dockets list all filings and motions), maybe I should try a different regex pattern on the Docket. Let's try \"enforce.*settlement\" but maybe with a different pattern. Wait, the user already tried that. Wait, the problem says the search on Docket found 0 matches. So maybe the Docket doesn't have it, but other documents do.\n\nWait, the other documents: Complaints, Motions, Orders. For example, a Motion for Enforcement of Settlement would be in a Motion document. So maybe the \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" or \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" might have such terms. But the user's previous search was only on the Docket. So maybe they should search other documents with a more general pattern.\n\nWait, the current step is Step 3, and the recent actions were Step 1: list_documents, Step 2: search_document_regex on Docket. Now, the next action should be to either search another document or read a document. Since the regex on Docket didn't work, maybe try searching all documents with a better pattern.\n\nThe checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement, so the pattern should look for words like \"enforce\", \"settlement\", \"motion to enforce\", \"contempt\", etc. Maybe the regex should be more inclusive. Let's think: possible patterns could be \"enforce settlement|settlement enforcement|motion to enforce|contempt for settlement\". But regex patterns can be tricky. Alternatively, use a pattern that's more likely to capture the terms, like \"enforce.*settlement\" but maybe with word boundaries.\n\nWait, the previous search used \"enforce.*settlement\" and found nothing. Maybe the actual text uses \"settlement\" in a different context. Maybe the term is \"settlement agreement\" instead of \"settlement\". So perhaps the pattern should be \"enforce.*settlement.*agreement\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to read the Docket document, since it's the most likely place to have a list of motions, and the regex didn't find anything, but maybe the Docket has the info in a different form. Wait, the Docket was searched, but maybe the search was too narrow. So perhaps the next step is to read the Docket document in full (or a large chunk) to check manually.\n\nBut the Docket is 9,260 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading it entirely is possible. The user should read the Docket document to look for any mentions of settlement enforcement. Since the regex search missed it, maybe the actual text uses different phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, search all documents with a more general regex. Let's consider using \"enforce|settlement\" as a pattern, but that might be too broad. Wait, the requirement is to extract disputes over enforcing a settlement, so the pattern should be more specific. Maybe \"motion to enforce settlement\" or \"enforce settlement agreement\".\n\nWait, the user's previous search used \"enforce.*settlement\", which might not have matched \"enforce settlement\" as two words. So changing the pattern to \"enforce settlement\" (without the dot-star) might work. But regex patterns need to handle spaces. So maybe \"enforce\\s+settlement\" to match \"enforce settlement\" with any whitespace.\n\nSo the next action should be to do a regex search on all documents with pattern \"enforce\\s+settlement\" to find matches. Since the Docket didn't have it, maybe other documents do. The available documents include Motions and Complaints, which might have the terms.\n\nWait, the \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" is 28k tokens. If that motion mentions enforcing a settlement, it's possible. So searching all documents with a better regex pattern would be better than reading one document.\n\nThe user has to choose one action. The current state shows that the Docket search returned 0 matches, so the next step is to try a different search pattern on all documents. So using search_document_regex with a more precise pattern.\n\nThe previous pattern was \"enforce.*settlement\", which might not have captured the actual terms. Let's try \"enforce\\s+settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\". Let's go with \"enforce\\s+settlement\" as a pattern. So the function call would be search_document_regex with pattern \"enforce\\\\s+settlement\", doc_name='all', top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nThat seems like the next logical step.

Maybe the documents use \"enforcement of settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\" instead. Also, \"settlement\" could be part of a longer phrase.\n\nThe user should try a broader regex pattern that captures variations. For example, using \"enforce.*settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\" to cover more cases. Since the previous regexes were too strict, expanding the pattern might help. The next step should be to search all documents with a more flexible regex. The pattern could be \"enforce.*settlement|settlement enforcement\" to catch different phrasings.\n\nAlso, checking the documents' types: there's a Docket, Complaints, Motions, Orders. The Docket might have entries about motions to enforce settlements. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction and other motions might mention settlement enforcement. But the regex didn't find anything, so maybe the exact terms aren't there, or they're using different language.\n\nWait, the user tried \"enforce\\s+settlement\" which requires a space between \"enforce\" and \"settlement\".

The problem is that the regex searches didn't find anything, but maybe the actual text uses different phrasing.

But the Docket is more likely to have a chronological list of filings, including motions related to enforcement. So starting with the Docket makes sense.\n\nThe next action should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, using read_document on the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 (but since it's 9260 tokens, end_token 9260) would cover the whole document.

The snapshot shows 0 values extracted for this key, and all documents except \"Docket\" are unvisited. The Docket was fully read in Step 5 (tokens 0-9260), but the search patterns used earlier (like \"enforce.*settlement\") found zero matches. The Docket text provided in Step 5 doesn't mention any settlement enforcement disputes—it's all about motions for TRO, preliminary injunctions, and case management. \n\nThe key exclusion here is \"exclude disputes over decrees.\" The Docket has an \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" (entry 53), but that's a decree, not a settlement enforcement issue. So the Docket doesn't contain the required data.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents: the other 7 are unvisited (marked ○ Unvisited).

But the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited docs (Docket is done), and to read unvisited ones.\n\nWait—the problem is the checklist item specifically wants \"settlement\" enforcement, not decrees. The Docket's \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" (entry 53) refers to a decree, so it's excluded per the definition. The other documents might have settlement terms. \n\nSince the regex searches failed, but the documents are unvisited, I should read one of the unvisited documents. The \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" (28,869 tokens) seems most likely to contain settlement details. But the token count is high—28k tokens, but the max per read is 10k.

The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction was partially read (10k tokens out of 28k), but the excerpt provided doesn't mention settlement enforcement disputes. The other documents are unvisited.\n\nHmm... the key is to look for specific phrases like \"enforce settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement\" in the remaining documents. Since regex searches on \"enforce.*settlement\" already failed, I should try a more targeted search. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction is partially read, but the text given ends at page 14 of 56. Maybe the full document contains relevant content.\n\nWait, the user's checklist definition specifies excluding disputes over decrees (consent decrees). So I need to be careful not to confuse those. The Docket shows motions like \"Emergency MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction,\" but those are about injunctions, not settlement enforcement.\n\nLooking at the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction excerpt, it discusses visa revocations and preliminary injunctions, not settlements. The other unvisited documents might hold the key. The \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" could contain settlement-related disputes, but I shouldn't assume.\n\nSince the regex searches failed, I'll try reading the next token range in the partially visited document (Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction) to see if it contains any settlement enforcement references. The current view is 0-10k tokens; the next range could be 10k-20k.

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is defined as disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order), excluding disputes over decrees.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, the user has already done several searches and reads. The search_document_regex attempts with patterns like \"enforce.*settlement\" and \"enforcement.*settlement\" didn't find anything. Then they read the Docket and the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction in multiple chunks.\n\nIn the Docket, I see entries about motions for temporary restraining orders, stipulations, and orders. But the key here is to find disputes specifically about enforcing a settlement, not decrees. The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction talks about visa revocations, SEVIS status, and legal arguments about Section 1201(i), but I don't see any mention of settlement enforcement disputes. The documents reviewed so far (Docket and Motion) don't contain the required information.\n\nThe current status shows that the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is empty. The available documents include other unvisited ones like the Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Ex Parte TRO, etc. But the user has already tried searching for \"enforce\" and \"settlement\" without success. However, maybe the unvisited documents might have relevant info.\n\nWait, the checklist definition excludes disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments). So, the user needs to look for motions to enforce settlements, not consent decrees. The Docket has entries like \"STIPULATION WITH PROPOSED ORDER\" and \"Order by Judge Susan Illston granting...\", but these are about scheduling or stipulations, not settlement enforcement.\n\nThe Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction is about visa revocations and legal challenges, not settlement enforcement. The other unvisited documents might include the Complaint or other motions that could have settlement-related disputes.\n\nBut the user has already done regex searches on all documents for patterns related to \"enforce\" and \"settlement\" without matches. However, maybe the unvisited documents have different phrasing. For example, \"settlement enforcement\" might be phrased as \"enforcement of settlement\" or similar.\n\nWait, the search patterns used were \"enforce.*settlement\" and \"enforcement.*settlement\", but maybe the actual document uses \"settlement enforcement\" instead. Let me check the previous search attempts. The user tried \"enforce.*settlement\" and \"enforcement.*settlement\", but perhaps \"settlement enforcement\" wasn't covered. So, maybe a new regex pattern like \"settlement enforcement\" would be better.\n\nBut the user's last action was a parse error. Now, they need to decide the next step. Since the current status shows that the key is empty and all visited documents have been checked, but there are unvisited documents, the next step should be to read one of the unvisited documents. However, the decision policy says to avoid rereading documents already fully visited. The unvisited documents are marked as ○ Unvisited, so they haven't been read yet.\n\nBut the user has already done multiple searches on all documents and found nothing. Maybe they should check if any of the unvisited documents might contain the term. The available unvisited documents include Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Ex Parte TRO, Order Granting Motions, etc.\n\nWait, the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions might have settlement-related info, but the title mentions \"Preliminary Injunctions\" not settlements. The Complaint might mention settlement, but typically complaints don't discuss settlement enforcement.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement. So, the document would need to have a motion or dispute specifically about enforcing a settlement agreement. For example, a motion to enforce a settlement, or a dispute where a party is asking the court to enforce a negotiated settlement.\n\nIn the Docket entries, there's a \"STIPULATION WITH PROPOSED ORDER\" which is a type of settlement (stipulated agreement), but the dispute would be if one party is not complying with the stipulation. However, the Docket entries don't mention enforcement disputes. For example, entry 11 is a \"STIPULATION WITH PROPOSED ORDER Re Schedule for Plaintiffs' Motion...\", and entry 12 is an order granting the stipulation. But there's no mention of a dispute over enforcing the settlement.\n\nThe Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction is about visa revocations, not settlements. So, maybe the unvisited documents don't contain the required information. If all documents have been checked and no matches found, then the key should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence. The evidence should be explicit text or a dispositive posture. For example, if the case is about a preliminary injunction and there's no settlement agreement (so no enforcement disputes), then it's Not Applicable.\n\nIn the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, the plaintiffs are seeking to set aside the visa revocation policy. The case seems to be about a policy challenge, not a settlement. The Docket entries don't mention any settlement agreement. The case is a lawsuit, not a case where a settlement was reached and then enforced.\n\nSo, the evidence for Not Applicable would be that the case involves a challenge to a government policy (visa revocation) and there's no settlement agreement mentioned, hence no disputes over enforcing a settlement. The absence of any settlement enforcement disputes in the documents.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to use update_checklist to set \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" to Not Applicable, with evidence from the documents showing no settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nWait, but the user needs to confirm that there are no such disputes. The previous searches didn't find any, and the documents reviewed don't mention settlements. So, the evidence would be the absence of any mention of settlement enforcement in the documents.\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding requires explicit text or dispositive posture. Since the documents don't mention any settlement, and the case is about policy challenges, not settlements, it's reasonable to mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nSo, the correct action is to use update_checklist with the key set to \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the documents. For example, citing that the case involves a challenge to a visa revocation policy (from the Motion), and no settlement agreements are referenced in the documents.\n\nLooking at the Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, it's a motion for preliminary injunction, not related to a settlement. The Complaint is about the visa revocation policy. The Docket entries don't mention settlements. So, the evidence is that the case is about a policy challenge, not a settlement, and no settlement enforcement disputes exist.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to call update_checklist with the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" and set it to \"Not Applicable\" with the evidence from the documents.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"The case involves a challenge to the Department of State's visa revocation policy under the APA, not a negotiated settlement agreement (Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, p. 5-8, 12-13).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 5-8, 12-13\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"No settlement agreements or enforcement disputes referenced in Docket entries (Docket entries 1-89 focus on motions for TRO, stipulations, and injunctions, not settlement enforcement).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Docket entries 1-89\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "The case involves a challenge to the Department of State's visa revocation policy under the APA, not a negotiated settlement agreement (Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, p. 5-8, 12-13).", "source_document": "Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 5-8, 12-13"}, {"text": "No settlement agreements or enforcement disputes referenced in Docket entries (Docket entries 1-89 focus on motions for TRO, stipulations, and injunctions, not settlement enforcement).", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket entries 1-89"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 44450, "completion_tokens": 1727, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
