Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The only action possible at this point is to list the documents to get the catalog. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet,\" so the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action is to use `list_documents` to find out what documents exist in the corpus.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not trying to read or search without knowing the documents first. The system's instructions say to call `list_documents` when the catalog is unknown. So, the next action should be to list the documents. No other functions make sense here because there's nothing to read or search yet. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system can't proceed without first discovering the available documents.\n\nSo, the JSON response should be a call to `list_documents` with no arguments.

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which requires the format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' The current status shows that no values have been extracted yet, and all documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain appeal information. Looking at the document list, the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" seems the most relevant. The title mentions \"Appeal,\" so that's a good candidate. The other documents like Complaints or Orders might not directly mention appeals, but the motion for stay pending appeal probably refers to an existing appeal.\n\nSince the catalog is known (8 documents listed), I don't need to call list_documents again. The next step is to read the relevant document. The motion for stay is 12,324 tokens, which is over 10k, so I should read a portion. But the instructions say to read a targeted window ≤10k tokens. Maybe start from the beginning, but the document might have the appeal info early. Wait, the motion for stay pending appeal likely discusses the appeal, so checking the first part makes sense.\n\nWait, the document is \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\". The motion is filed to stay the case while an appeal is pending. So the motion itself would mention the appeal, like which court it's going to. So reading the document, especially sections where they reference the appeal.\n\nBut since the user hasn't read any documents yet, I should choose to read the most relevant one. The \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" is the top candidate. Let's use read_document on that. Start from token 0 to 10,000. Wait, the document is 12,324 tokens, so 0-10,000 is safe. But maybe the key info is in the first part. Let's go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search_document_regex could be faster. The pattern might be something like \"appeal\" or \"stayed pending appeal\". But the instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The checklist item is about the appeal details, so a regex like \"Appeal: [^\\.]+?\" but maybe better to search for \"appeal\" and then read the surrounding text. However, the user's policy says to use read_document as the default. Since the motion title mentions \"Appeal\", it's better to read that document first.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" from start_token 0 to end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3408, "completion_tokens": 613, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value about appeals, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key is empty, and there are 8 documents in the corpus. The user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" (document 0-10000 tokens). Now, I need to check if that document contains any appeal information.\n\nScanning through the provided text from the document, I see on page 9, line 2: \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\" The cases listed are Doe v. Trump (4:25-cv-3140), Chen v. Noem (4:25-cv-3292), J.C. v. Noem (4:25-cv-3502), S.Y. v. Noem (4:25-cv-3244), and W.B. v. Noem (4:25-cv-3407). \n\nSo the appeal information here is that Defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit in these five cases. The parties involved are the Defendants (U.S. government) appealing against the Plaintiffs (e.g., John Doe, S.Y., etc.). The appellate court is the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe required format is 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So the value should be \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\" but need to specify the cases. Wait, the checklist says \"distinct value\" for each unique appeal. The document mentions five cases, but the appeal is from the Defendants to the Ninth Circuit across these cases. However, the checklist item is about the appeal itself, not the cases. The appeal is the action taken by the Defendants, so the value would be \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\" as the main point.\n\nWait, but the document says \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\" So the parties are the Defendants (as appellants) and the court is Ninth Circuit. The plaintiffs are the ones who were granted the injunction, so the appeal is by the Defendants (the government) against the plaintiffs' victory.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" The cases are part of the context but not part of the value. The checklist item is about the appeal, not the specific case numbers.\n\nNow, checking the evidence: the text says \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit...\" So the evidence is that exact sentence. The source document is \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\", and the location is page 9, line 2 (or token range, but since we're using the page reference from the document, maybe \"Page 9\" is acceptable).\n\nWait, the document's page numbers are given as \"Case 4:25-cv-03292-JSW Document 68 Filed 08/08/25 Page 9 of 17\". So the location is \"Page 9\".\n\nSo the evidence would be:\n- text: \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\"\n- source_document: \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\"\n- location: \"Page 9\"\n\nThe value is \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" Wait, the exact wording in the checklist requires the format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So the value should be \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\".\n\nBut the document says \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit\", so the parties are Defendants, court is Ninth Circuit. So the value is correct.\n\nNow, since the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty, and we've found a value, the next step is to append this to the checklist. The action should be append_checklist with the extracted value.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say: \"append_checklist: add new entries; Do not set Not Applicable via append_checklist.\" So we need to append the value as a new entry.\n\nThe extracted list for \"Appeal\" should have this entry. The evidence must include the text, source, and location.\n\nSo the parameters for append_checklist would be a patch with key \"Appeal\", and extracted array containing one entry with evidence and value.\n\nThe value is \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\", and the evidence is the text snippet from the document.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"the extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\", so the actual value stored should be the full string. Wait, no—the instruction says \"the extracted value should be formatted as...\", so the value to store is that string. Wait, no, the example says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\", so the value should be exactly that string. Wait, the checklist definition says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nWait, maybe the value to extract is the string \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" But looking at the example in the requirements, it says \"formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\", so the actual value should be that string. But in the evidence, the text is \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit...\", so the extracted value should be the formatted version.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" and \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nSo the value to store is the formatted string. So in this case, the value is \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut wait, the example in the document says \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit\", so the parties are Defendants, court is Ninth Circuit. So the formatted value is \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nSo the value field in the extracted entry should be \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut the evidence's text should be the exact sentence from the document.\n\nWait, the evidence should be the verbatim text from the document that supports the value. So the evidence.text would be \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\"\n\nThen the value is \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nSo the extracted entry would have value as that string.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other appeals in the document. The rest of the document talks about the motion for stay pending appeal, but the only explicit mention of an appeal is that filing on July 21. The other parts refer to the appeal but don't mention the parties or court again. So this is the only appeal mentioned here.\n\nSo we have one value to extract.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value to the checklist using append_checklist.\n\nThe parameters for append_checklist would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 9\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the location in the document is \"Page 9\", which is part of the document's pagination. The document says \"Case 4:25-cv-03292-JSW Document 68 Filed 08/08/25 Page 9 of 17\", so location is \"Page 9\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, check if the document has been fully visited. The document is marked as partially visited with tokens 0-10000 (81% coverage). The text we read includes up to page 14, but the relevant part is on page 9. Since we've already read up to token 10000, which covers page 9, we don't need to read more of this document for this value.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the above parameters.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\", \"source_document\": \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\", \"location\": \"Page 9\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.", "source_document": "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "location": "Page 9"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14411, "completion_tokens": 1950, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract \"Appeal\" information from legal documents, and I've already found one entry in the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal document. The current checklist shows \"Appeal\" has one value: \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\" with evidence from page 9.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are 7 unvisited documents left (only the Motion document is partially visited). The checklist only has one item to extract (\"Appeal\"), and it's already been partially filled. But I need to check if there are more appeals mentioned in other documents.\n\nThe next logical step is to check other documents for additional appeal information. The Motion document was partially read (only up to token 10,000), but the appeal mention was already found on page 9. Since the checklist item is \"Appeal\" and we need all distinct values, I should look for other appeal references in other documents.\n\nThe document catalog shows 8 documents total. The Motion document is partially visited (81% coverage), but the appeal info was found early in the document (page 9). The other documents are completely unvisited (○ Unvisited). I should read the next most relevant document that might contain appeal information.\n\nLooking at the document list:\n- Complaints (Complaint, First Amended Complaint) - likely contain initial filings but probably not appeals\n- Docket - might list appeals\n- Orders (Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction Order) - could mention appeals\n- Motions (Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, Notice of Motion) - might reference appeals\n\nThe Docket document seems most promising for appeal information since dockets typically list procedural events like filings of appeals. The \"Docket\" document has 9,260 tokens and is unvisited.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Docket document, starting from token 0. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the whole document (within 10,000 token limit) to check for appeal mentions.\n\nWait, the document size is 9,260 tokens, which is under 10,000, so reading the entire document is safe. No need for regex search here since I'm looking for a specific type of information in a specific document type.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on \"Docket\" with start_token 0 and end_token 9260 (or just the full token count). But since the token count is 9,260, I'll set end_token to 9260.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other documents that might have appeal info. But the Docket is the most likely place to find formal appeal filings. The Motion document already gave one appeal entry, so checking the Docket for additional entries makes sense.\n\nThe checklist only has one item (\"Appeal\"), so I need to find all distinct appeal references across all documents. The current extracted value is from the Motion document. Now I'll check the Docket document to see if it contains more appeal information.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 9260}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 9260}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14520, "completion_tokens": 688, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting \"Appeal\" information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal: Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one value from the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" document. The value is \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" The evidence is from page 9 of that document, where it says \"On July 21, 2025, Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\"\n\nNow, checking the Docket document, which is fully visited (tokens 0-9260). In the Docket, there's an entry 62: \"2025-07-21 | NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\" So this confirms the appeal to the Ninth Circuit, with the appealing parties being Kristi Noem and Todd M. Lyons.\n\nWait, the current extracted value says \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" The Docket entry lists Kristi Noem and Todd M. Lyons as the appellants. But in the context, the Defendants are Kristi Noem and Todd M. Lyons (since they're the ones opposing the plaintiffs). So the extracted value is correct as \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut the user needs to check if there are more appeals. The Docket entry 62 mentions the Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit. The extracted value already includes that. The other documents are unvisited. However, the Docket is fully visited, and the evidence is already captured in the existing entry. Wait, the existing entry's evidence is from the Motion document, but the Docket also confirms it. However, the checklist requires evidence from the document. Since the Motion document already provided the evidence, and the Docket is a separate document, but the appeal is the same, do they need to add another entry?\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The value here is the same: \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit.\" So even though it's mentioned in multiple documents, it's the same value, so only one entry is needed. The existing entry is sufficient.\n\nNow, checking the other documents. The \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" (Document 5) might have more details, but the appeal is already captured. The Motion for Stay Pending Appeal (Document 2) is partially visited (81% covered), but the relevant part was read in the initial step (tokens 0-10000). The Docket (Document 1) is fully visited and confirms the appeal. The other documents (Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc.) are unvisited, but they might not contain appeal information since appeals happen after the initial order. The Motion for Stay Pending Appeal is the document where the appeal is mentioned, and the Docket confirms it.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Appeal,\" and the value should be \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" The existing entry is correct. The Docket entry 62 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" So the appealing parties are Kristi Noem and Todd M. Lyons, who are the Defendants. So the value \"Defendants appealed to Ninth Circuit\" is accurate.\n\nIs there any other appeal mentioned in other documents? The current status shows 1 value extracted, and the checklist has only one key. The user needs to check if there are more distinct values. But since it's the same appeal, there's only one distinct value.\n\nThe available documents: Docket is fully visited, so no need to read it again. The Motion document is partially visited, but the relevant part (page 9) was read. The other documents are unvisited, but it's unlikely they contain appeal information since the appeal was filed on July 21, 2025, and the other documents are earlier filings (like Complaints, TROs, etc.).\n\nSo, the checklist key \"Appeal\" is already filled with one value. The user should check if there are any other values. But since all documents are checked (Docket fully visited, others unvisited but not relevant), and the existing entry is correct, they should stop.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 62 is part of the Docket document, which is fully visited. The existing evidence was from the Motion document, but the Docket also has the same info. However, the checklist requires evidence from the document where the value is found. The existing entry's evidence is from the Motion document, which is correct. The Docket entry confirms it but doesn't add a new value.

The task is to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, specifically the \"Appeal\" item from legal documents.

The format should be \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nFrom the prior actions:\n- Step 1: `list_documents` found 8 documents.\n- Step 2: Read `Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal` (tokens 0-10000), found the appeal to the Ninth Circuit on page 9.\n- Step 3: `append_checklist` added the appeal value.\n- Step 4: Read the `Docket` (tokens 0-9260), found entry 62: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\"\n- Step 5: Tried to stop, but the system automatically ran `get_checklist` and showed that Appeal has 1 value.\n- Step 6: The current status shows all keys are filled (1 out of 1), and the documents are either fully visited or partially visited.\n\nThe available documents include:\n- **Docket** is fully visited (9260 tokens, 0-9260).\n- **Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal** is partially visited (12,324 tokens, 0-10000 viewed, 21% left).\n- The other 6 documents are unvisited.\n\nBut the checklist item \"Appeal\" has already been extracted from two sources: the Motion (page 9) and the Docket (entry 62).

However, the checklist status shows 1/1 keys filled, so there's no missing data.\n\nThe key point is whether there are more distinct appeal values to extract. The Motion mentions \"Defendants filed notices of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in the five related cases.\" The Docket entry 62 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Both refer to the same appeal, so it's one distinct value. There's no indication of other appeals in the documents read so far.\n\nThe system's automatic review after the first stop shows that all keys are filled.

The other documents (like Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc.) are unlikely to contain new appeal information since the appeal was already documented in the Motion and Docket. The system's instruction says not to reread fully visited documents, and Docket is fully visited. The Motion is partially visited, but the relevant part (page 9) was already read.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop again, as the system allows two stop attempts, and this is the second one.
