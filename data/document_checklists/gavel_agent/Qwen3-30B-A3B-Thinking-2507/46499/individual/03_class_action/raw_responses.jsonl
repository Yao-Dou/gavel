The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The current status shows that there are no documents discovered yet. The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the documents in the corpus count is 0.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first. So the only valid action here is `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 192, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document to look at. The available documents are all unvisited. The Complaints and Motions are likely where the class action status would be mentioned. The First Amended Complaint might have the most relevant info since it's an amended version, possibly clarifying the class status.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is a good candidate. It's a Complaint, which typically states the nature of the lawsuit, including whether it's a class action. The token count is 13,733, which is over 10k, but the read_document function allows up to 10k tokens. So I should read the first 10k tokens to check for the class action mention.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex unless the pattern is clear. Since the exact phrasing might vary, but \"Class Action\" is a common term, maybe a regex search could work. But the instructions say to use search only when the target is clearly patternable. However, the user's example uses \"Case No.\" as a pattern, so maybe a regex for \"Class Action\" would be okay. But the safest first step is to read the main document where the status is most likely to be stated, which is the Complaint.\n\nWait, the Complaint and First Amended Complaint are both possible. The First Amended might have updated info, but the original Complaint might have the initial status. Since both are unvisited, starting with the First Amended Complaint makes sense. Let's call read_document on that document for the first 10,000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3438, "completion_tokens": 455, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to specify whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first document read was the \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (tokens 0-10000). In the text, the plaintiffs are listed as \"Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Jing Tao, Yifeng Wu, and Wanrong Li\". Each of them is described as individuals, and the complaint mentions \"Plaintiffs\" in the heading. The complaint is filed by these six individuals, not as a class action. The text also refers to them as \"Plaintiffs\" multiple times, but there's no mention of a class action. The case is a class action? Wait, no. Wait, the plaintiffs are named individually, so it's individual plaintiffs. But the requirement says to format as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the complaint, the plaintiffs are listed as individuals. The caption says \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; ...\" etc. So they are all individual plaintiffs. The description is that they are international students. So the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\".\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"with a brief description of the individuals when applicable\". So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\".\n\nI need to check if there's any mention of a class action. The text says \"Plaintiffs\" plural, but they are named individually. The complaint is for each of them, so it's not a class action. The document says \"First Amended Complaint\" but the plaintiffs are listed individually. So it's individual plaintiffs.\n\nIn the text, on page 1, it says \"Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Jing Tao, Yifeng Wu, and Wanrong Li\" as the plaintiffs. Each is described as an individual. So the correct entry is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\".\n\nNow, I need to extract this and provide evidence. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is on page 1 of the complaint, where the plaintiffs are listed. The exact quote is \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; JING TAO, an individual, YIFENG WU, an individual, and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs\".\n\nWait, looking at the document, in the caption:\n\n\"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; JING TAO, an individual, YIFENG WU, an individual, and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs,\"\n\nSo the evidence text is that line. The source document is \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and location is \"Page 1, caption\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\". Wait, the description should be \"international students\" as per the text. The plaintiffs are all international students, as mentioned in the complaint (e.g., \"highly accomplished international students\" in paragraph 8).\n\nSo the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\".\n\nNow, since this is the first value extracted for the checklist item, I need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is as above.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\".\n\nThe evidence needs to have the text, source document, and location. The text is the part where they list the plaintiffs as individuals. The location is page 1, as per the document's page numbers.\n\nSo the evidence would have:\n- text: \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; JING TAO, an individual, YIFENG WU, an individual, and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs\"\n- source_document: \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- location: \"Page 1, Caption\"\n\nWait, the document shows \"Case 4:25-cv-03292-JSW Document 64 Filed 07/29/25 Page 1 of 21\", so location is \"Page 1\".\n\nSo the append_checklist should include this entry.\n\nNow, the next action is to append the checklist with this value. The current status shows that the key is empty, so we need to add this value. Since it's the first value, append_checklist is the right action.\n\nI need to make sure not to use update_checklist here because it's the first entry. Append_checklist adds to the list.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the patch for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, with the extracted value as described.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; JING TAO, an individual, YIFENG WU, an individual, and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs\", \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1, Caption\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students", "evidence": [{"text": "ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; JING TAO, an individual, YIFENG WU, an individual, and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs", "source_document": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1, Caption"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14388, "completion_tokens": 1348, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they need to format it as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they already did a `read_document` on the First Amended Complaint (tokens 0-10000) and found one value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\". They appended that using `append_checklist`. Now, the current status shows 1 out of 1 key has a value, so all keys are filled. But wait, the checklist definition says to extract EVERY distinct value. The current value they have is \"Individual, described as international students\", but maybe there's more in other documents.\n\nWait, the available documents show that the First Amended Complaint is only partially visited (73% coverage). The next step should be to check if there's more information in the same document. But the user's instructions say not to reread fully visited documents, but this one is partially visited. However, the previous read was tokens 0-10000, and the document has 13,733 tokens, so there's about 3,733 tokens left. But the system says to read only unviewed ranges. However, the user might need to check if the class action status is mentioned again elsewhere.\n\nBut the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The current value says \"Individual\", but maybe the complaint mentions it as a class action. Wait, the current extraction says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as international students\", which seems correct because the plaintiffs are listed as individuals. But maybe the complaint's caption or elsewhere it's stated as a class action. Wait, looking at the document content, on page 1, the plaintiffs are listed as \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; ... and WANRONG LI, an individual; Plaintiffs\". So they are individual plaintiffs. The complaint is not a class action; it's a group of individuals suing together, but not as a class action. So the correct value should be \"Individual, described as international students\".\n\nBut the user's current extraction has that value. The checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so if there's only one value, that's it. However, maybe other documents mention it differently. For example, maybe the Docket or another pleading refers to it as a class action. But the current status says all keys are filled (1/1), so maybe it's done. Wait, the \"Keys with Values\" is 1/1, so all keys are covered. But the user needs to make sure there's no other value. The system says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Since there's one value, and the key is filled, they should stop.\n\nWait, but the system's Stop Criteria says to verify with `get_checklist` before stopping. The current step is to check if all keys are done. The recent action was `append_checklist` which added the value. Now, they should call `get_checklist` to confirm all keys are filled. But the user's available actions include `get_checklist`. However, the instructions say that after appending, if all keys are filled, then stop. But the system might require a `get_checklist` to confirm.\n\nWait, looking at the current status: \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so the only key is filled. The checklist item is done. The next step should be to stop. But the user should make sure there's no other value. However, the checklist item is only one key, and it's filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" Here, it's filled, so stop. The reason is that the only checklist item has been successfully extracted with the correct value. The document they read shows the plaintiffs are listed as individuals, so \"Individual\" is correct.
