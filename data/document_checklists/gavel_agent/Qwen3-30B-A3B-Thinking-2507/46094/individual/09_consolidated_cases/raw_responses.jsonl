The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents.\n\nLooking at the tools, list_documents is the right function to use here. The other options like read_document or search require existing documents, which don't exist yet. So, the correct action is to call list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. Since there are no documents listed, the next logical move is to discover them. The user's instructions say to use list_documents when the catalog is unknown, which applies here. No need to check anything else.

The user needs to extract all instances of \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is looking for any indication that the case has been consolidated with others, including identifying info.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The Docket and various Orders might mention consolidation. The Docket (8,395 tokens) is a good candidate because it often lists case management actions, including consolidations. The Memorandum Opinion (39k tokens) could also have it, but since it's longer, maybe start with the Docket first.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is marked as unvisited. Since the user hasn't read any documents yet, the next logical step is to read a portion of the Docket. The Docket is 8,395 tokens, so reading the entire thing might be efficient. But wait, the system says not to read more than 10k tokens, which is okay here. However, maybe the consolidation info is in a specific part. But without knowing, starting from the beginning makes sense.\n\nWait, the user has to choose exactly one action. The options are list_documents (but they already did that), read_document, search_document_regex, etc. Since the catalog is known (33 docs), and the Docket seems relevant, using read_document on the Docket from start to end (0-8395 tokens) would be the next step. But the problem is, the Docket might have the info early on, so reading the whole thing is safe here since it's under 10k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex with a pattern like \"consolidat\" or \"consolidated\" to find matches faster. But the instructions say to prefer precise patterns. The regex \"consolidated\" might be good. Let me think: the checklist is \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", so the pattern should look for \"consolidated\" in the text. Using search_document_regex with pattern \"consolidated\" could quickly find relevant sections. Then, once the matches are found, use read_document on those specific parts. But the user needs to choose one action. Since the document catalog is known, and the Docket is a key document, maybe start with searching the Docket specifically.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex can target a specific document. So using doc_name='Docket' and pattern 'consolidated' would search just that document. That's efficient. The Docket is likely to have consolidation info, so searching there first would be smart. The regex pattern \"consolidated\" is precise enough. Let's go with that.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with doc_name 'Docket' and pattern 'consolidated'. That way, I can get the exact matches and their context without reading the whole document. Then, based on the results, decide if I need to read more.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"consolidated\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "consolidated", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4274, "completion_tokens": 668, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all instances of \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about any indication that the case has been consolidated with others, including identifying info.\n\nLooking at the current status, the only document that's partially visited is the Docket, and in the recent actions, they did a search_document_regex on \"consolidated\" which found a match in the Docket. The match shows a minute order mentioning that the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits. So that's a direct hit.\n\nThe next step is to process that found evidence. The search returned a match in the Docket document, tokens 3959-4159. The text snippet says \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\". So that's a clear indication of consolidation.\n\nNow, according to the decision policy, after a search_document_regex, the next action should be to either read the document (but since the search already provided the context, maybe it's sufficient to use the evidence from the search result) or append the checklist entry. Wait, the search returned the context, so the evidence is already there. The task is to extract the value with evidence.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\". The value here is the mention of consolidation in the minute order. The extracted value should be the specific indication, which is the part about consolidating the motion with the merits. But the requirement says to extract every distinct value. The value here would be the statement that the case is consolidated, so the evidence would include the text snippet.\n\nThe evidence needs to have text, source_document, and location. The source document is Docket, location is the token range mentioned (3959-4159), and the text is the verbatim snippet from the match.\n\nSince the search already found the match and provided the context, the next step is to append this to the checklist. The key is Consolidated_Cases_Noted, and the extracted value should be the relevant part. Wait, but the exact value to extract is the indication of consolidation. The text says \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits\". So the value might be \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\" or just the fact that consolidation occurred. But the instruction says to extract the distinct value as per the document. So the value here is the specific mention.\n\nBut the checklist definition says \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So the value would be the text that indicates consolidation. So the extracted value is the phrase from the document. Wait, but the example in the problem statement shows that the extracted value should be the actual indication. So in this case, the value is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\" or maybe a shorter version. However, the evidence must include the verbatim text. So the value would be the key phrase, but the evidence includes the full context.\n\nWait, the evidence's 'text' field should be the verbatim snippet. So for the extracted value, the 'value' is the specific part that indicates consolidation, but the evidence's 'text' is the full context. Wait, no. The evidence is the supporting text. So the extracted value (the thing being listed) is the indication, and the evidence is the part of the document that supports it.\n\nWait, looking at the Evidence Requirements: \"Every extracted entry must include evidence with text (verbatim snippet), source_document, location.\"\n\nSo the 'value' in the extracted entry is the actual value to be recorded, and the evidence is the text from the document. For example, if the document says \"Case A is consolidated with Case B\", the value would be \"Case A and Case B\" or \"consolidated with Case B\", and the evidence text would be the full sentence.\n\nIn this case, the document says \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits\". So the value to extract is the fact that consolidation is happening, so the value might be \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\" or \"consolidated with the merits consideration\". But the exact wording might be better. However, the checklist says \"any indication\", so the value is the indication itself. So the value is the phrase that states consolidation.\n\nBut according to the instructions, each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context. So the value here would be the specific text that indicates consolidation, which is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\".\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", so the value is the note about consolidation. So the value is the text that says it's consolidated. So the extracted value should be the exact phrase from the document that indicates consolidation.\n\nLooking at the search result, the text is: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nSo the value to extract is that sentence fragment. But the problem says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so each time consolidation is mentioned, it's a separate entry. Here, it's a single mention, so one entry.\n\nNow, the evidence needs to have the text (verbatim snippet), source_document (Docket), location (tokens 3959-4159).\n\nSo the extracted entry's value would be the text snippet, but wait, the value is the extracted value, which is the indication. So the value is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\".\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item is \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", so the value is the note that consolidation happened. So the value is the statement that it's consolidated. So the value is the exact text from the document that indicates it.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is the phrase mentioned. The evidence's text is the same as the value? Or the evidence's text is the surrounding context. Wait, the evidence's text is the verbatim snippet from the document. So in this case, the evidence's text would be the entire match text, which is the 200 tokens around the match. But in the search result, they provided the match as tokens 3959-4159, and the text snippet given is part of that.\n\nSo for the evidence, the 'text' field should be the verbatim text from the document (the snippet provided), source_document is Docket, location is tokens 3959-4159.\n\nSo the extracted entry would have:\n\nvalue: \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\"\n\nevidence: [ { text: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"tokens 3959-4159\" } ]\n\nWait, but the value should be the extracted value, which is the indication. So the value is the phrase that indicates consolidation, which is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\".\n\nSo the value is that string, and the evidence text is the same. But the evidence needs to be the verbatim text from the document. So the evidence's text is exactly that phrase.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to append this to the checklist. Since it's the first entry, we need to use append_checklist to add this value.\n\nLooking at the tools, append_checklist is for adding new entries. So the patch should have key \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", and extracted array with one entry containing the value and evidence.\n\nThe evidence array has one item, which has text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the arguments for append_checklist would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 3959-4159\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the location in the evidence should be the specific location. The search result says \"Match 1 (tokens 3959-4159)\", so the location is tokens 3959-4159.\n\nSo that's the correct location.\n\nSince this is the first value for this key, and we're appending it, the next action is append_checklist with this patch.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, so after appending, it should show 1 value.\n\nTherefore, the correct action here is to call append_checklist with the above parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"tokens 3959-4159\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Consolidated_Cases_Noted", "extracted": [{"value": "consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 3959-4159"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4562, "completion_tokens": 2113, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" from legal documents. They've already done a few steps. Step 1 was listing documents, found 33.

Step 3 appended that value to the checklist.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Consolidated_Cases_Noted has one value from the Docket. The checklist only has that one item, and it's marked as having a value. But the user needs to make sure there are no other instances of consolidated cases in other documents. The available documents include the Docket (partially visited), and many others that are unvisited.\n\nThe task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So even though they found one, they need to check other documents. The Docket has been partially read (only tokens 3959-4159), but maybe there's more in the Docket or other documents.\n\nWait, the Docket is marked as \"◐ Partially Visited\" with viewed tokens 3959-4159 (2% coverage). The Docket has 8,395 tokens, so 2% is about 168 tokens. But the match they found was at 3959-4159, which is a small part. Maybe there's more in the Docket? But they already found the relevant part. However, the user should check other documents for \"consolidated\" mentions.\n\nThe next step should be to search other documents. The previous search was only on the Docket. The next logical step is to search all documents for the regex pattern \"consolidated\" to find any other instances. The tool available is search_document_regex. The parameters would be pattern: \"consolidated\", doc_name: \"all\" to search all 33 documents.\n\nWait, the previous step used search_document_regex on Docket (doc_name specific), but now they should search all documents. The available function allows doc_name='all' to search all. So the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"consolidated\" and doc_name \"all\". That will check all documents for the term, which might find more matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe read other documents, but searching is more efficient.

The user wants me to extract all checklist items related to \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that there's already one value extracted from the Docket document. But the recent search across all documents found 15 matches in various documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, most are unvisited (marked with ○). The search results show matches in documents like the Brief of Amici Curiae, Emergency Motion for a Stay, Memorandum Opinion, and Order (004). However, the user mentioned that the Docket document was partially visited, and the search found matches in other documents too.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", which is about any indication that the case has been consolidated with other cases, including identifying information. The existing extracted value is from the Docket: \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\".\n\nBut the search found more matches. For example, in the Emergency Motion for a Stay (002), there's a mention of \"the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\" That's another instance of consolidation.\n\nAlso, in the Memorandum Opinion, there's \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\" Wait, the rule here is 65(b), but it's still a consolidation. So that's another value.\n\nSimilarly, in the Order (004), it says \"the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\" So that's another mention.\n\nThe task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So each unique mention needs to be a separate entry. The existing entry from the Docket is one, but there are more in other documents.\n\nThe next step is to read the relevant parts of the documents where these matches were found to get the exact text for evidence. But since the search already provided the context (the token ranges), maybe the next action is to append those values to the checklist.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that after a search_document_regex, the next action should be append_checklist or update_checklist. The search found 15 matches, but some are duplicates. For example, the Docket was already processed in Step 3, so the new matches in other documents need to be added.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Brief of Amici: The text mentions \"federal power is instead consolidated in a select few accountable to no one.\" But this is about federal power being consolidated, not the case being consolidated with other cases. So this might not be relevant. The checklist is about the case being consolidated, not general consolidation. So this match might not count. Need to check if it's about the legal case consolidation.\n\n- Emergency Motion for a Stay (002): The matches mention consolidation with the merits under Rule 65(a)(2). So this is relevant.\n\n- Memorandum Opinion: Mentions consolidation with merits under Rule 65(b). So that's another instance.\n\n- Order (004): Mentions consolidation as requested by defendants.\n\nSo the Brief of Amici's match is probably not relevant because it's talking about federal power, not case consolidation. So the other matches (Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion, Order) should be considered.\n\nThe current extracted value is from Docket. Now, the new values to add are from Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion, and Order.\n\nEach of these needs to be appended with evidence. The search results provided the exact text snippets, so the next step is to append those to the checklist.\n\nThe user's recent actions show that Step 4 was a search_document_regex on all documents, which found 15 matches. Now, the assistant should use append_checklist to add the new entries from the relevant documents.\n\nBut need to make sure that each entry is distinct. For example, the Docket entry is one, and the other documents have different mentions but similar content. However, each is a separate instance in the documents, so they should all be included as separate entries.\n\nWait, the checklist item is to extract every distinct value. So if the same phrase appears in multiple documents, each occurrence should be a separate entry. But the problem says \"distinct value\", so maybe if the value is the same, it's only listed once. Wait, the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So \"distinct\" here probably means unique phrases. But the example in Step 3 shows that they listed the exact text from the Docket. So even if the same phrase is used in multiple documents, it's one value. Wait, no—the instruction says \"EVERY distinct value\", so if the value is the same, it's one entry. But in this case, the values might be slightly different.\n\nWait, the existing value is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\". The Memorandum Opinion says \"consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\". So the rule number is different (65(a)(2) vs 65(b)), so it's a distinct value. Similarly, the Order (004) says \"consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\" So that's another distinct value.\n\nSo the new values to append are:\n\n1. From Emergency Motion (match 4): \"the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nWait, the exact text from the search results for Emergency Motion (002) match 4 is: \"The Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nBut the Docket entry was from a Minute Order: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nSo the wording is slightly different, but the key part is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)\". So the value would be the full phrase as found. However, the checklist item says \"any indication\", so the exact text snippet is the value.\n\nWait, the example in Step 3 lists the value as the exact text from the document. So each extracted value is the exact string from the document. Therefore, each match in the search results should be a separate entry if the text is different.\n\nBut in this case, the Emergency Motion's match 4 has the same rule number (65(a)(2)) but a slightly different phrasing. So it's a different string, so it's a different value.\n\nSimilarly, the Memorandum Opinion's match 1 has \"consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\"\n\nSo the value here is different because of the rule number.\n\nThe Order (004) match 1 says \"the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\"\n\nSo that's another value.\n\nTherefore, these three should be added as separate entries.\n\nThe Brief of Amici's match is about federal power, so it's not relevant. So the other matches in the search results (like the Memorandum Opinion's other matches) might not be relevant. For example, Memorandum Opinion match 2 doesn't mention consolidation, so it's not relevant.\n\nSo the relevant new entries are from Emergency Motion (002) match 4, Memorandum Opinion match 1, and Order (004) match 1.\n\nNow, the assistant needs to append these to the checklist.\n\nThe current checklist has one entry. The next action should be append_checklist with these new entries.\n\nBut the user's current status shows that the documents are partially visited. The Emergency Motion (002) has been partially visited (viewed tokens 11196-11596, etc.), but the specific token ranges for the matches are already provided in the search results. So the assistant doesn't need to read the document again; the search already provided the context.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use append_checklist with the new values from the search results.\n\nEach value needs evidence: text, source_document, location (tokens).\n\nSo for the Emergency Motion (002) match 4: tokens 25905-26105, the text is \"The Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nSimilarly, Memorandum Opinion match 1: tokens 655-855, text: \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\"\n\nOrder (004) match 1: tokens 2051-2251, text: \"the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\"\n\nSo these three should be appended.\n\nThe existing entry from Docket (tokens 3959-4159) is already there.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with these three new entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal (002)\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 25905-26105\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Opinion\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 655-855\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (004)\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 2051-2251\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Consolidated_Cases_Noted", "extracted": [{"value": "the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of their positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).", "source_document": "Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal (002)", "location": "tokens 25905-26105"}]}, {"value": "the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).", "source_document": "Memorandum Opinion", "location": "tokens 655-855"}]}, {"value": "the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.", "evidence": [{"text": "the motion for a preliminary injunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.", "source_document": "Order (004)", "location": "tokens 2051-2251"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8522, "completion_tokens": 2436, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 6, "run_id": "6712665a-5414-41c0-b4a5-a68add8bfe1d", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T01:01:56.829381-04:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking to extract all checklist items related to \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" from the legal documents. From the current status, they've already extracted 4 values across different documents. The checklist item is about any indication of case consolidation with other cases, including identifying info.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 5 already appended 3 new values from different documents (Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion, Order (004)), bringing the total to 4. The current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning all checklist items are covered, but I need to confirm if all possible values are extracted.\n\nThe available documents show most are unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the checklist is already filled. However, the system says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\" so I should check if any other documents might have more mentions of consolidation. But the last action was appending 3 values, and the current status lists 4 total values.\n\nWait, the \"Extraction Progress\" says \"4 values (1 from Docket, 1 from Emergency Motion..., 1 from Memorandum Opinion, 1 from Order (004))\". The Docket entry was from Step 3, and the other three from Step 5. So all 4 are accounted for.\n\nNow, checking the document coverage: the partially visited documents have only a small percentage viewed (2-14%), but the regex search in Step 4 already found all 15 matches across 33 documents. The search results showed 15 matches, but the extracted values are 4 distinct ones. The other matches might be duplicates or irrelevant (like the \"consolidated\" in the Florida brief about federal power, not case consolidation).\n\nThe key point: the checklist item is specifically about case consolidation (e.g., \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\"), not general use of \"consolidated\". The Florida brief's \"federal power is instead consolidated\" is about government structure, not case consolidation, so it shouldn't count. Similarly, the Emergency Motion's Match 1-5 include some irrelevant \"consolidated\" uses.\n\nThe user's Step 4 search found 15 matches, but only 4 are valid for the checklist. The Step 5 append added the three new valid ones. The Docket match was already handled in Step 3. So all valid values are extracted.\n\nNow, the system requires confirming all keys are filled. The status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 4\" and \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". The next step should be to stop because all applicable values are extracted. No more documents need to be read since the regex search already covered all possible matches, and the valid ones are already appended.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, it's filled with 4 values. The checklist has only one item, so no Not Applicable needed. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nI should verify if there's any chance of missing values. The regex search was done on \"consolidated\" across all documents, and the search results were processed. The Step 5 append added all valid ones. The unvisited documents might have more \"consolidated\" mentions, but if they're not about case consolidation (like the Florida brief example), they shouldn't be included. Since the search was done with the pattern \"consolidated\", but the extraction requires context to confirm it's about case consolidation, the system already filtered those in the append steps.\n\nThus, all valid values are extracted. The next action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 4 distinct values for Consolidated_Cases_Noted have been extracted with supporting evidence from relevant documents.

The user has been working on extracting \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" values from legal documents, and the system has already found 4 distinct values through previous steps.\n\nLooking at the current status:\n- The checklist item \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" has 4 values extracted\n- The system shows \"All 4 distinct values for Consolidated_Cases_Noted have been extracted\" from Step 6\n- The most recent action was a `get_checklist` (Step 7) showing \"1/1 filled, 0 empty\"\n- The available documents include 33 total, but many are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited)\n\nWait, but the user's Step 6 already called `stop`, and now the system is doing an automatic checklist review. The current status shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1 (meaning all keys are filled)\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Total Values Extracted: 4\n\nThe system's instruction says: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, there's only one key (\"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\") and it's complete with 4 values.\n\nI should check if there are any gaps. The regex search in Step 4 found 15 matches across documents, but the extraction process in Steps 3 and 5 captured 4 distinct values. The evidence shows these were taken from different documents (Docket, Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion, Order (004)), and all are valid references to case consolidation.\n\nThe system's automatic review (Step 7) confirms \"1/1 filled\" with 4 values. Since there are no empty keys or Not Applicable items needed, and the extraction process has covered all relevant documents (the regex search was comprehensive), there's no need for further action.\n\nThe \"Stop Criteria\" explicitly states to stop when all keys are complete. The current state meets this. The previous \"stop\" call (Step 6) was premature because the system needed to verify with `get_checklist`, but now that verification is complete (Step 7), it's time to finalize.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to issue a final `stop` with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted with supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 4 distinct values for Consolidated_Cases_Noted have been extracted with supporting evidence from relevant documents.
