The user is trying to extract related cases from legal documents, but the current status shows no documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is empty, and there are zero documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next move is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and currently, it's empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain case numbers. The checklist item is about related cases, so documents like the Docket, Orders, and Motions might have references to other cases. The Docket is a good candidate because it usually lists all related cases. Also, the Memorandum Opinion might mention related cases in the text.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket (8,395 tokens) is unvisited and a common place to find case references. The Memorandum Opinion (39,263 tokens) is also a possibility, but maybe the Docket is more straightforward. The user mentioned \"case code number,\" so the Docket might have a section where related cases are listed with their numbers.\n\nSince the document catalog is known (33 documents listed), I don't need to call list_documents again. The next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain the needed info. The Docket seems the best bet. The Docket's name is \"Docket [Docket] - 8,395 tokens - ○ Unvisited\", so I should use read_document on that.\n\nI should check if there's a regex pattern that could help, but since the user says to use read_document as the default, and the Docket is a specific document, reading it directly makes sense. The Docket probably has a list of related cases, so reading the entire document (or a relevant part) would be efficient. The token count is 8,395, which is under the 10k limit, so I can read the whole thing.\n\nWait, the system says not to reread visited documents, but this one is unvisited. So I'll call read_document on \"Docket\" with start_token 0 and end_token 8395. That should get the whole document. Then, after reading, I'll look for case numbers like \"Case No. XYZ\" or similar patterns. Once I find them, I'll use append_checklist to add the entries with evidence.\n\nNo need for regex search here because the Docket is a specific document that's likely to have the info, and reading it directly is straightforward. So the next action is to read the Docket document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8395}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8395}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4278, "completion_tokens": 561, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at the recent actions. They already did a `list_documents` and found 33 documents. Then they read the Docket document (tokens 0-8395), which is fully visited. The Docket entry has some entries that mention USCA case numbers. Let me check the Docket text.\n\nIn the Docket, there's an entry on 2025-02-11: \"USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J. TRUMP, KAREN GORMAN, SERGIO GOR, SCOTT BESSENT.\" Then on 2025-02-13: \"USCA Case Number 25-5028 for 15 Notice of Appeal...\". Later, on 2025-03-03: \"USCA Case Number 25-5052 for 34 Notice of Appeal...\".\n\nSo the related case codes are 25-5025, 25-5028, and 25-5052. These are the case numbers listed in the Docket entries. The Docket is fully visited, so I can extract these from there.\n\nThe checklist item requires each distinct value with evidence. Each USCA case number is a distinct value. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document (Docket), and location (the specific Docket entry).\n\nI need to check if there are other documents that might have more related cases. But the Docket seems to have the main ones. The other documents are unvisited, but since the Docket already has these case numbers, maybe they're the only ones. However, the user needs to check all documents, but the Docket is fully read and contains these entries.\n\nWait, the Docket is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I can use that. The extracted values from Docket are 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052. Each should have their own evidence entry.\n\nNow, the next step is to use `append_checklist` to add these values. Each value needs to be a separate entry in the extracted list. For each case number, I'll create an evidence entry with the text snippet, source document (Docket), and location (the date and entry number).\n\nLet me confirm the exact text from Docket:\n\n- USCA Case Number 25-5025... (entry 7)\n- USCA Case Number 25-5028... (entry 15)\n- USCA Case Number 25-5052... (entry 34)\n\nSo the values are \"25-5025\", \"25-5028\", \"25-5052\".\n\nEach needs evidence. For example, for 25-5025: text is \"USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court...\", source is Docket, location is the entry on 2025-02-11.\n\nSame for the others. So I'll create three entries in the extracted list for the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nSince the checklist item is empty, appending these three values is the way to go. The next action should be `append_checklist` with these three entries.\n\nI need to make sure each evidence has text, source_document, location. The location can be the date and entry number as mentioned in the Docket. For example, \"2025-02-11, Docket Entry 7\" or similar.\n\nWait, the Docket entries have numbers like \"7\" and \"15\" as the entry numbers. So for the first one, entry 7 on 2025-02-11. But the Docket text shows \"7 | 2025-02-11 | NOTICE OF APPEAL TO DC CIRCUIT COURT...\". So the location could be \"Docket Entry 7, 2025-02-11\".\n\nSimilarly, entry 15 on 2025-02-13: \"15 | 2025-02-13 | USCA Case Number 25-5028...\".\n\nEntry 34 on 2025-03-03: \"34 | 2025-03-03 | USCA Case Number 25-5052...\".\n\nSo the locations are Docket Entry 7, 15, 34 with their respective dates.\n\nNow, I need to structure the append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted list of three entries.\n\nEach entry in extracted should have evidence (array of one evidence object) and value.\n\nSo for each case number, value is \"25-5025\", evidence text is the snippet from Docket, source_document is \"Docket\", location is \"Docket Entry 7, 2025-02-11\".\n\nWait, the Docket entry for 25-5025 is listed as:\n\n\"7 | 2025-02-11 | NOTICE OF APPEAL TO DC CIRCUIT COURT by SCOTT BESSENT, SERGIO GOR, KAREN GORMAN, KARL KAMMANN, DONALD J. TRUMP, RUSSELL VOUGHT. Fee Status: No Fee Paid. Parties have been notified. (McMahon, Madeline) (Entered: 02/11/2025)\"\n\nBut the USCA Case Number is mentioned in a separate line: \"None | 2025-02-11 | USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J. TRUMP, KAREN GORMAN, SERGIO GOR, SCOTT BESSENT. (zdp)\"\n\nAh, so the exact text for the case number is in the \"None\" entries. The Docket has entries with \"None\" as the first column, which might be the case numbers. So the text to cite is \"USCA Case Number 25-5025...\" etc.\n\nTherefore, the evidence text should be the full line: \"USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J. TRUMP, KAREN GORMAN, SERGIO GOR, SCOTT BESSENT. (zdp)\" for the first one.\n\nLocation can be \"Docket, 2025-02-11\" or more specifically \"Docket Entry (None) 2025-02-11\". But since the Docket is a single document, the location is the date and the fact that it's in the Docket.\n\nBut the user's instructions say location should be e.g., page, section, docket entry. Here, the Docket entries are listed with dates, so \"2025-02-11\" as location.\n\nWait, the Docket text has lines like:\n\n\"None | 2025-02-11 | USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J. TRUMP, KAREN GORMAN, SERGIO GOR, SCOTT BESSENT. (zdp)\"\n\nSo the location can be \"2025-02-11\" since that's the date of the entry.\n\nSo for each, the location is the date when the USCA case number was mentioned.\n\nSo for 25-5025: location \"2025-02-11\"\n\n25-5028: \"2025-02-13\"\n\n25-5052: \"2025-03-03\"\n\nNow, the evidence text for each is the exact line where the case number appears.\n\nSo, the append_checklist should have three entries under the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nThe current checklist is empty, so appending these three will fill it.\n\nI should not use update_checklist because it's appending new entries, not replacing. The item can have multiple values, so append is correct.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the three entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"25-5025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"None | 2025-02-11 | USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J.

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and they've already extracted three values from the Docket document: 25-5025, 25-5028, and 25-5052.\n\nLooking at the current status, all three values were found in the Docket document, which is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The Docket document was read in Step 2, and the values were appended in Step 3. The system shows that the Docket has 100% coverage, so there's no need to read it again.\n\nNow, the available documents include other types like Complaint, Mandate, Orders, and Motions. But the checklist item specifically asks for case codes. The Docket entries were the ones with the USCA Case Numbers (25-5025, etc.). The other documents might not contain such case numbers. For example, the Mandate documents have USCA Case Numbers like 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052, but those are the same as the ones already extracted. Wait, the Mandate entries (44, 45, 46) mention USCA Case Numbers 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052. But those are the same case numbers as before. The user needs to check if these are duplicates or if there's a different case code elsewhere.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\". The Docket already listed those three case numbers. The Mandate documents refer to the same case numbers. So reading those might not add new values. The user should check if there are other case numbers in other documents. But the Docket is the primary source for case numbers, and it's already fully read. The other documents might not have additional case codes. For example, the Complaint might have the case number of the current case (like 25-CV-239), but that's the main case, not a related one. The related cases are the appeals, which are 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for USCA Case Number 25-5025 was from 2025-02-11, which is the first appeal. Then 25-5028 on 2025-02-13, and 25-5052 on 2025-03-03. The Mandate entries (44,45,46) also reference these same numbers. So those are the same three cases. The user has already extracted all three. Are there any other related cases mentioned elsewhere?\n\nLooking at the document list, the other documents like \"Order on Emergency Motion...\" or \"Defendants' Motion...\" might refer to other cases, but the checklist item is specifically about case codes. The main case here is 25-CV-239 (from the Complaint: \"COMPLAINT against SCOTT BESSENT... filed by HAMPTON DELLINGER. (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit A... No. 25-CV-239)\"). But that's the main case, not a related one. The related cases are the appeals, which are the USCA numbers.\n\nSo the three values already extracted are all the related cases. The user needs to confirm if there are any other case numbers. Let's check the other documents. For example, the \"Mandate\" documents (44,45,46) mention the USCA case numbers, but they're the same as the ones already extracted. The \"Order\" documents might reference other cases, but the problem states to extract \"related matters\" which are the appeals. The Docket has all the USCA case numbers listed, and they've been captured.\n\nThe current status shows that all keys (only one key) have 3 values. The user needs to check if there are any more. But since the Docket is fully visited and no other document has new case codes, the extraction is complete. The next step would be to stop, as all values are extracted.\n\nWait, the system says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The three values are distinct and from the Docket.
