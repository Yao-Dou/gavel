The checklist item is empty, and the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters. That's the only function needed here to proceed.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3176, "completion_tokens": 256, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The first step is to figure out which document might contain the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is a good starting point because complaints often state who is representing each party. It's the first document listed and has 7,527 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read. Since it's unvisited, I should read the entire document to check for counsel types. The other documents like Orders or Motions might have references, but the Complaint is the most likely place to find initial counsel information.\n\nI should use read_document for the Complaint, starting at token 0 to the end. That way, I can get all the content in one go without missing anything. There's no regex pattern needed here since the info is probably in the body of the complaint. Let me confirm the document name: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with the [Complaint] tag. So the action is to read that document from start to finish.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7527}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7527}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4350, "completion_tokens": 303, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires identifying the type of counsel for each side (plaintiff and defendant), using specific labels like private counsel, government counsel, etc., and including organizations in parentheses if possible.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The snapshot shows that \"Type_of_Counsel\" is empty with 0 values extracted. The only document that's been read so far is the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, which is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The text from that document is provided, so I need to analyze it for counsel information.\n\nLooking at the Complaint, the plaintiff is Hampton Dellinger, and the defendants are various government officials. The attorneys listed at the end are from Hecker Fink LLP. The signature line says: \"Attorneys for Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger\" followed by the firm's name and addresses. The firm is a private law firm, so the counsel type would be \"private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\".\n\nNow, checking the defendants' side. The Complaint mentions the defendants' names but doesn't list their attorneys. The document is the plaintiff's complaint, so the defendants' counsel might be in other documents. However, the current read document (Complaint) only shows the plaintiff's counsel. The defendants' counsel isn't mentioned here, so I can't extract that from this document. \n\nSince the checklist says to extract only if the type is clear from the documents, and the defendants' counsel isn't specified in the Complaint, I shouldn't make assumptions. Therefore, the only value I can extract from the current document is for the plaintiff's side.\n\nThe requirement is to create separate entries for each side. Here, the plaintiff's counsel is private counsel from Hecker Fink LLP. The defendants' counsel isn't mentioned, so no entry for them. The checklist says not to include a side if the type isn't clear, so defendants' side remains unextracted.\n\nThe evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text in the Complaint's signature line is: \"HECKER FINK LLP\" with the attorneys' names. The location is the bottom of the document (page 15), so I'll cite that.\n\nI need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The key is \"Type_of_Counsel\", and the value should be \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\" as per the example given. The evidence should include the text snippet, document name, and location.\n\nWait, the example says \"private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se\". Here, Hecker Fink LLP is a private law firm, so \"private counsel\" is correct. The organization name is included in parentheses as specified.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\" with evidence from the signature block. Since this is the first entry, I'll append it. No need for update_checklist yet because it's the first value.\n\nCheck if there are other entries in the document. The Complaint doesn't mention defendants' counsel, so no other values. The other documents haven't been read yet, but according to the process, after reading a document, I should extract all possible values from it before moving on. Since the current document only gives the plaintiff's counsel, that's the only entry to add.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append the checklist entry for Type_of_Counsel with the extracted value and evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"HECKER FINK LLP\\n350 Fifth Avenue, 63rd Floor\\nNew York, New York 10118\\n(212) 763-0883\\nkdoniger@heckerfink.com\\njmatz@heckerfink.com\\njerpenbach@heckerfink.com\\nbstern@heckerfink.com\\n*Applications for pro hac vice pending\\nAttorneys for Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 15, signature block\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)", "evidence": [{"text": "HECKER FINK LLP\n350 Fifth Avenue, 63rd Floor\nNew York, New York 10118\n(212) 763-0883\nkdoniger@heckerfink.com\njmatz@heckerfink.com\njerpenbach@heckerfink.com\nbstern@heckerfink.com\n*Applications for pro hac vice pending\nAttorneys for Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 15, signature block"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12365, "completion_tokens": 917, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. So far, they've already read the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and found that the plaintiff's counsel is \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\" from the signature block on page 15.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: the checklist key Type_of_Counsel has one value, and all other keys (empty and Not Applicable) are zero. The corpus has 33 documents, but only the Complaint is fully visited. The rest are unvisited. The next step is to check if there are other documents that might contain more counsel types, especially since the checklist says to extract EVERY distinct value.\n\nThe user mentioned that if both sides are represented, they should have separate entries like 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. So I need to check if the defendants' counsel is mentioned anywhere. The Complaint has the plaintiff's counsel, but the defendants might be represented by government counsel. \n\nLooking at the available documents, there are several motions, briefs, and orders. The Defendants' Motion to Stay, Defendants' Opposition, and other defendant-related documents might have their counsel listed. For example, the \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Court's Order Pending Appeal\" could have the defense attorneys' info.\n\nI should search for defendant counsel in those documents. Since the Complaint already has the plaintiff's counsel, the next logical step is to check defendant documents. The most relevant ones would be the Defendants' motions or oppositions.\n\nThe document names like \"Defendants' Motion to Stay...\", \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion...\", etc., are good candidates. But I need to read them to find counsel info. However, I can't read all at once. The next action should be to read a specific document that's likely to contain defendant counsel.\n\nThe \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" is 10,548 tokens, which is over 10k, so I need to read a window. But the system says not to read more than 10k tokens at a time. Wait, the document is 10,548 tokens, so I can read 0-10,000 first. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for patterns like \"Counsel for Defendant\" or \"Attorneys for Defendants\" to find where counsel is listed. The regex could be something like r\"Counsel for Defendant|Attorneys for Defendants|Defendant's counsel|Defendants' counsel\". \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. Since the defendant counsel is likely labeled in a standard way, regex search might be efficient. Let me check the available tools. The search_document_regex function can search all documents or specific ones. Since the defendant counsel is probably in the defendant's filings, maybe search all documents with the regex pattern.\n\nBut the document catalog shows that the Complaint is fully visited, and the rest are unvisited. So searching all documents might find the defendant counsel in the defendant's motions. The regex pattern should be precise. Let's use \"Counsel for Defendant\" as a pattern. The flags can be IGNORECASE to catch variations.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call search_document_regex with pattern \"Counsel for Defendant\" to find where the defendant's counsel is listed. Then, based on the matches, read the relevant sections to get the evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was append_checklist for the plaintiff's counsel. Now, to find defendant's counsel, I need to check the defendant's documents. The search should target the defendant-related documents. But since I don't know which ones, searching all documents with the regex is the way to go. The search will return top matches, and then I can read those sections.\n\nYes, so the next step is to use search_document_regex with pattern \"Counsel for Defendant\" to locate the defendant's counsel details. That should efficiently find where the defendant's counsel is mentioned, which is necessary to complete the Type_of_Counsel checklist item.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Counsel for Defendant\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200, \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Counsel for Defendant", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200, "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12555, "completion_tokens": 930, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, they've already extracted one value from the Complaint: \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they have one key with a value, but the checklist item is Type_of_Counsel. The requirement says to extract every distinct value, including both sides (Plaintiff and Defendant). The previous extraction was for the Plaintiff's counsel. Now, the Defendants' counsel hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nIn the Recent Actions, Step 4 used search_document_regex with \"Counsel for Defendant\" and found matches in several documents. The matches show \"Counsel for Defendants\" with Madeline M. McMahon from the U.S. Department of Justice. So the Defendant's counsel is the U.S. Department of Justice, which would be government counsel.\n\nThe checklist definition says to include specific organizations in parentheses. For government counsel, it should be \"Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\". The search results mention \"U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch\", so the organization is U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe next step is to extract this value. Since the search found matches, I should read the relevant documents to get the exact evidence. The matches were in multiple documents, but the ones with the \"Counsel for Defendants\" line are the ones to check. The documents like \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" have the match at tokens 1576-1685. So I should read that token range to confirm the evidence.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows that \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" is partially visited (viewed tokens 1576-1685, which is 6% coverage). The search found a match at 1576-1685, which is already viewed. But the user needs to confirm the evidence. However, the search already provided the context, so maybe they can use that. But according to the system, after a search, they should use read_document to get the full context. Wait, no—the search_document_regex returned the context, so the evidence is already there. But the system says to use read_document to confirm. Wait, the policy says: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\"\n\nIn this case, the search_document_regex was done, and it found the matches. Now, the next step should be to append the extracted value for Type_of_Counsel with the evidence from the search results.\n\nThe value for Defendant should be \"Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\". The evidence is from the \"Counsel for Defendants\" line in the Defendants' documents. The search results show the match includes the U.S. Department of Justice as the organization.\n\nSo, the next action is to append this value. The existing extracted value is for the Plaintiff (Hecker Fink LLP), and now adding the Defendant's counsel.\n\nCheck the checklist definition: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nWait, the example says \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\", so the value should be \"Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\", which is for the Plaintiff. The new value should be for the Defendant. So the new entry should be \"Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nBut the checklist definition says \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)).\"\n\nSo for the Defendant, it's Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice), and since it's the Defendant, it should be prefixed with \"Defendant: \".\n\nWait, the example in the checklist says \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\", so the value should be \"Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nSo the extracted value for Type_of_Counsel should have two entries: one for Plaintiff and one for Defendant.\n\nThe previous entry was for Plaintiff: \"Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)\".\n\nThe new entry from the search is for Defendant: \"Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nSo the next step is to append this new value using append_checklist.\n\nCheck if the evidence is properly cited. The search result shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" followed by the DOJ info. So the evidence would be the text snippet from the document where \"Counsel for Defendants\" appears, along with the document name and location (page or token range).\n\nIn the search results, the document \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" has the match at tokens 1576-1685. The evidence text would be the context around that match. But since the search already provided the context (the snippet), I can use that as the evidence.\n\nSo the new entry should have:\n- value: \"Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\"\n- evidence: the text from the search match (the snippet provided), source_document: \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\", location: tokens 1576-1685.\n\nWait, the search results for \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" had the match at tokens 1576-1685. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source, and location.\n\nThe verbatim text from the search result is:\n```\nLINE M.

The user is asking me to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, they've already done a few steps: listed documents, read the complaint, found one counsel (private counsel from Hecker Fink LLP), then did a regex search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" which found the U.S. Department of Justice as government counsel.\n\nNow, looking at the current status, they have two values for Type_of_Counsel: one from the complaint (Plaintiff's side: Private counsel (Hecker Fink LLP)) and one from the defendants' motion (Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)). The checklist says to extract each side separately as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. So the current entries are correct.\n\nWait, but the complaint's signature block says \"Counsel for Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger\" and lists Hecker Fink LLP. The defendants' motions all have \"Counsel for Defendants\" with U.S. Department of Justice. So the two entries are properly separated by side.\n\nThe user's next step is to check if there are any other documents that might have more counsel types. The available documents show that some are partially visited, like the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Emergency Motion, but they've only viewed small parts. However, the regex search already found all instances of \"Counsel for Defendant\" across the documents, and the complaint already gave the plaintiff's counsel.\n\nWait, the regex search found matches in multiple defendant documents, but all of them point to the same U.S. Department of Justice counsel. So no new counsel types there. The other documents are unvisited, but since the regex search already covered all the defendant motions and found the same counsel, maybe there's no need to read more.\n\nBut the checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value. The two values are already present: Plaintiff's private counsel and Defendant's government counsel. Are there any other sides or counsel types? The case has multiple defendants, but they're all represented by the same government counsel. So no additional entries needed.\n\nCheck the documents: the Complaint shows Plaintiff's counsel as Hecker Fink (private), and the defendants' motions show U.S. DOJ as government counsel. The other documents like the Memorandum Opinion or Orders might not have additional counsel info, but the regex search didn't find any other \"Counsel for\" mentions beyond what's already extracted.\n\nSo the checklist key Type_of_Counsel is complete with two entries.
