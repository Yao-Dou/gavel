But without any documents, I can't find any evidence. The system's decision policy says that if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is definitely unknown here.\n\nSo the next logical step is to use `list_documents` to discover what documents are available. The user mentioned that if the catalog is unknown, that's the first action. There's no point in trying to read a document or search when there are none listed. I should make sure to call `list_documents` first to get the list of documents before proceeding.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the correct function here. It requires no parameters, so the JSON should just have the function name. I need to make sure I don't do anything else like `read_document` because there are no documents to read yet. The snapshot clearly states \"Documents in Corpus: 0\", so listing them is the only possible action now.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3184, "completion_tokens": 303, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract two specific checklist items: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the provided legal documents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state. The snapshot shows that both checklist items are empty, and there are 33 unvisited documents. The task is to systematically extract all applicable values with proper evidence.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket seems like a prime candidate because dockets typically list case consolidations and related cases. The Docket document has 8,395 tokens and is marked as unvisited. Since the Docket is a standard place to find case consolidation information, reading it makes sense as the next step.\n\nI should avoid reading the entire document at once since the maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, and the Docket is under that. But to be efficient, I'll start by reading the beginning of the document where case numbers and consolidation notes are usually listed. The Docket's first few pages would likely contain the relevant info.\n\nThe other documents like Orders or Motions might mention related cases, but the Docket is the most comprehensive source. So, using `read_document` on the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 (since it's under 10k tokens) seems appropriate. This will give me the initial text to analyze for the checklist items.\n\nI need to make sure I don't miss anything, so reading the whole Docket in one go is efficient here. The next step after reading would be to check the text for any mentions of consolidated cases or related case numbers. If found, I'll use `append_checklist` to add those entries with evidence from the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8395}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8395}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4358, "completion_tokens": 417, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 3, "run_id": "cca54f77-ef54-4543-a528-694f607e887c", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T16:03:59.947110-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's tackle this legal checklist extraction task. The user needs me to extract two specific items from the provided case documents: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". \n\nFirst, I'll review the current status. The Docket document has already been fully read (tokens 0-8395), but it's empty for both checklist items. The user's recent actions show they've only read the Docket so far. Now, I need to figure out which documents might contain the required information.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, there are 33 documents. The Docket is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are mostly unvisited (marked with ○). The key is to find documents that might mention consolidated cases or related case numbers.\n\nThe checklist items are:\n- Consolidated_Cases_Noted: Any indication of consolidation with other cases.\n- Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: Related matters identified by case numbers.\n\nFrom the Docket's content, I see references to \"USCA Case Number\" entries. For example, on 2025-02-11, there's \"USCA Case Number 25-5025\" for the Notice of Appeal. Similarly, on 2025-02-13, \"USCA Case Number 25-5028\" appears. These are case codes related to the appeal. The related cases would be these USCA case numbers.\n\nThe Docket already has these entries, but since the checklist is empty, I need to extract them. The Docket was fully read, so the text should be available. Wait, the Docket was read in the previous step (Step 2), and the text includes these USCA case numbers. But the checklist is still empty, so maybe the extraction wasn't done yet.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions say Step 2 was reading the Docket (0-8395), and the text provided includes the USCA case numbers. So I should use that to extract the related cases.\n\nFor \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", the USCA case numbers are 25-5025, 25-5028, and 25-5052. These are listed in the Docket entries (items 7, 15, 34, etc.). For example:\n- Entry 7: \"USCA Case Number 25-5025\"\n- Entry 15: \"USCA Case Number 25-5028\"\n- Entry 34: \"USCA Case Number 25-5052\"\n\nSo those are the related case codes. Each is a separate value. The checklist item expects a list of these case numbers.\n\nFor \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", I need to check if there's any mention of consolidation. Looking through the Docket, there's a mention in the Minute Order of 2025-02-15: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\" So that's a consolidation note. The key here is \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\", which is a procedural consolidation. So \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" would have that entry.\n\nWait, the definition says \"any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" The Docket entry mentions consolidation, but not with another case number. It's consolidating the motion with the merits, not another case. So maybe it's not a case consolidation but a procedural consolidation. The checklist might require actual case numbers being consolidated. The example given in the problem statement for related cases uses USCA case numbers, so consolidation might refer to other cases being merged into this one.\n\nWait, the Docket entry on 2025-02-15 says \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\" – that's not consolidating with another case, but consolidating the motion with the merits. So maybe there's no actual case consolidation mentioned. Let me check other parts of the Docket.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries again, there's no mention of other case numbers being consolidated with this case. The USCA cases are appeals from this case, not consolidations of cases. So \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" might be empty. But the user needs to confirm.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"consolidated with other case(s)\", so if there's no indication of other cases being consolidated, then it should be marked as Not Applicable. But the evidence needs to be checked.\n\nFrom the Docket, the only mention of consolidation is in the context of the motion and merits, not other cases. So \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" might not have any values. But I should check if there's another document that mentions consolidation with other cases.\n\nBut the user hasn't read any other documents yet. The Docket is the only one read so far. So the Docket text might be the only source for this information. Since the Docket mentions consolidation (procedural), but not with other case numbers, it's unclear if that counts. The checklist definition says \"consolidated with other case(s)\", so if it's not with another case, then it's not applicable.\n\nWait, the example in the problem statement for Related Cases uses USCA case numbers, which are appeals from this case. So \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" would be those USCA numbers. The consolidation item might not have any entries.\n\nBut the Docket entry on 2025-02-15 says \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\" – this is a procedural consolidation within the same case, not with another case. So it doesn't meet the definition of \"consolidated with other case(s)\". Therefore, \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nHowever, the user needs to confirm. Since the Docket is fully read, and no other documents are read yet, I need to check if the Docket has any other mentions. Let me re-read the Docket text provided.\n\nIn the Docket, item 14 (2025-02-12) mentions \"the administrative stay entered on February 10, 2025, Minute Order (Feb. 10, 2025), is hereby VACATED.\" No consolidation. Item 20 (2025-02-14) says \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits...\" So that's consolidation within the case, not with another case. So it doesn't count for \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" as per the definition. Therefore, this key should be Not Applicable.\n\nFor \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", the USCA case numbers are 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052. These are listed in the Docket entries. For example:\n\n- Entry 7: \"USCA Case Number 25-5025\"\n- Entry 15: \"USCA Case Number 25-5028\"\n- Entry 34: \"USCA Case Number 25-5052\"\n\nSo these three case numbers should be extracted for the related cases.\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be cited with source document (Docket), location (entry numbers), and verbatim text.\n\nSo for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, each case number is a separate value. The extracted entries would be:\n\n1. Value: \"25-5025\", Evidence: \"USCA Case Number 25-5025\" from Docket entry 7.\n2. Value: \"25-5028\", Evidence: \"USCA Case Number 25-5028\" from Docket entry 15.\n3. Value: \"25-5052\", Evidence: \"USCA Case Number 25-5052\" from Docket entry 34.\n\nFor Consolidated_Cases_Noted, since the only mention is procedural consolidation, not with other cases, it should be marked as Not Applicable. The evidence would be the text from the Minute Order: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nBut the checklist definition says \"consolidated with other case(s)\", so this doesn't fit. Therefore, it's Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next step is to use append_checklist for the related cases and update_checklist for the consolidation item as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's previous step was reading the Docket, and now they need to process that text. The Docket is fully visited, so the text is available. The checklist items are empty, so I need to append the related cases and set consolidation to Not Applicable.\n\nBut according to the process, after reading a document, the next action should be append_checklist or update_checklist if values were found.\n\nSo for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, I'll append the three case numbers. Each as separate entries with evidence.\n\nFor Consolidated_Cases_Noted, since there's no indication of consolidation with other cases, I need to set it to Not Applicable using update_checklist.\n\nWait, the definition says \"Not Applicable\" requires a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\". So I'll do update_checklist for that key with a single entry.\n\nSo the next action should be to make two function calls: one for append_checklist with the related cases, and one for update_checklist for consolidation.\n\nBut the instructions say \"choose exactly ONE action per turn\". So I can batch multiple keys in one call. For append_checklist, I can include multiple keys, but for consolidation, it's update_checklist. So I need to do two separate actions? Wait, no, the tools allow batching in one call. For append_checklist, the patch can have multiple keys. Similarly, update_checklist can have multiple keys.\n\nWait, the append_checklist function's description says: \"You MAY batch multiple checklist keys in ONE call by adding multiple items to patch.\"\n\nSimilarly for update_checklist.\n\nSo I can do one append_checklist for the related cases, and one update_checklist for the consolidation. But since each is a separate function, I need to make two separate tool calls. But the user is supposed to choose one action per turn. So first, I should do append_checklist for the related cases, then update_checklist for consolidation.\n\nBut the user's current turn is to choose one action. So the first action should be append_checklist for the related cases.\n\nWait, the related cases have three values. Each value should be a separate entry in the extracted list. So in the append_checklist, the \"extracted\" array should have three entries, each with their own evidence.\n\nSo for the patch in append_checklist:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"25-5025\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"USCA Case Number 25-5025\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Entry 7 (2025-02-11)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"25-5028\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"USCA Case Number 25-5028\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Entry 15 (2025-02-13)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"25-5052\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"USCA Case Number 25-5052\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Entry 34 (2025-03-03)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThen, for Consolidated_Cases_Noted, use update_checklist to set it to \"Not Applicable\".\n\nThe evidence for Not Applicable would be the text from the Docket that mentions consolidation but not with another case. So the evidence text would be the Minute Order text: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\"\n\nSo the update_checklist patch would be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Entry 20 (2025-02-15)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nBut since the user can only do one action per turn, I need to choose either append or update first. The instructions say after reading a document, the next action is append or update. Since there are values to append for related cases, the first action should be append_checklist for that key.\n\nThen, in the next turn, do the update_checklist for consolidation.\n\nBut the user's current state requires one action. So the correct first action is append_checklist for the related cases.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"25-5025\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"USCA Case Number 25-5025 for 7 Notice of Appeal to DC Circuit Court filed by KARL KAMMANN, RUSSELL VOUGHT, DONALD J.

The user needs me to extract two checklist items from legal case documents. The current status shows that \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" has been filled with three values from the Docket, but \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" is still empty. The task is to find any indication of consolidation with other cases.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any mention of case consolidation in the remaining unvisited documents. The Docket was fully read, and it didn't have any consolidation mentions. The other documents are mostly orders, motions, and briefs. The key here is to look for phrases like \"consolidated,\" \"consolidated with,\" \"related cases,\" or similar terms.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the ones that might contain such information are the orders and opinions. For example, \"Order and Opinion\" or \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have consolidation details. Also, the \"Mandate\" documents could reference other cases, but the Docket already captured the USCA case numbers, which are related but not necessarily consolidated.\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" specifically asks for indication that the case has been consolidated with other cases. So I need to find if there's a statement that says, \"This case is consolidated with Case X\" or similar.\n\nSince the Docket was fully read and didn't have it, I should check other documents. The next logical step is to read one of the unvisited documents that's likely to contain such information. The \"Order and Opinion\" (4,219 tokens) or \"Memorandum Opinion\" (39,263 tokens) might be good candidates. But since the user can only read up to 10k tokens at a time, maybe start with the smaller \"Order and Opinion\" document.\n\nAlternatively, using a regex search for \"consolidated\" or \"consolidated with\" across all documents might be efficient. The policy says to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. The phrase \"consolidated\" is a clear pattern, so using a regex like `consolidated` could find relevant sections. That might be faster than reading each document individually.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows that \"Order and Opinion\" is unvisited, but the regex can search all documents. However, the instructions say to avoid broad patterns. But \"consolidated\" is a specific term, so it's probably safe. Let me check the regex parameters. The pattern would be \"consolidated\" with possible variations, but the exact term is what's needed. Using `consolidated` as the pattern should work.\n\nSo, the next action should be `search_document_regex` with pattern \"consolidated\" to find any mentions in the documents. This will return matches with context, which I can then verify. If there are matches, I can then read the specific sections to get the evidence. If not, I might need to check other terms, but starting with \"consolidated\" is the most direct approach.\n\nAlso, the user has to choose one action per turn. Since the current key is empty and the Docket didn't have it, searching for the term makes sense. So the correct action is `search_document_regex` with pattern \"consolidated\".\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"consolidated\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "consolidated", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13341, "completion_tokens": 738, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting checklist items from legal case documents. They've already done Steps 1-4, and now they're at Step 5. The current task is to extract two checklist items: Consolidated_Cases_Noted and Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number.\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already extracted three values for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the Docket document (USCA Case Numbers 25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052). So that key is filled. The other key, Consolidated_Cases_Noted, is still empty.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is fully visited (8395 tokens, 100% coverage). The other documents are partially visited or unvisited. The user did a regex search for \"consolidated\" earlier, which found matches in several documents. Let me check where those matches are.\n\nIn the search results, there's a match in the Docket (tokens 3959-4159) that says: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\" That's a clear indication of consolidation. Also, in the Memorandum Opinion (Match 1, tokens 655-855), it says: \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).\" Wait, but the key is Consolidated_Cases_Noted, which refers to cases being consolidated with other cases, not just motions. Hmm.\n\nWait, the definition says: \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So it's about other cases being consolidated, not just the motion being consolidated with the merits. The Docket entry mentions consolidation of the motion with the merits, but that's part of the same case, not consolidation with another case. So maybe that's not relevant.\n\nLooking at the other matches: in the Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal (002), there's a mention of consolidation. Wait, the search results for \"consolidated\" in the Emergency Motion (Match 3, tokens 25499-25699) says: \"the Court consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits.\" Again, same case, not consolidation with another case.\n\nWait, the key is about cases being consolidated with other cases. The USCA case numbers (25-5025, etc.) are related cases, but they're appeals of the same case, not consolidated cases. Consolidation usually means merging multiple cases into one. For example, if two separate cases are being handled together as one.\n\nIn the search results, the only mention of consolidation is about the motion being consolidated with the merits, which is procedural within the same case. The key Consolidated_Cases_Noted is about cases being consolidated with other cases. So maybe there's no actual consolidation of cases here, just procedural consolidation.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 4 search for \"consolidated\" found matches, but the actual text refers to \"consolidated with consideration of the merits\" which is a different thing. So the checklist item Consolidated_Cases_Noted might not have any entries. But the user needs to check if there's any actual case consolidation.\n\nWait, the Docket has entries about the USCA case numbers. For example, Entry 7: USCA Case Number 25-5025 for the Notice of Appeal. Similarly for 25-5028 and 25-5052. But these are appeals from the same case, not consolidation of different cases. So the main case (1:25-cv-00385) has related appeals, but the cases themselves aren't consolidated. Consolidation would be if, say, two different cases (like 1:25-cv-00385 and 1:25-cv-00386) are merged into one case.\n\nLooking through the documents, I don't see any mention of other cases being consolidated with this one. The related cases are appeals, not consolidated cases. So perhaps Consolidated_Cases_Noted should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. The regex search found mentions of \"consolidated\" in the context of procedural consolidation (motion with merits), but not case consolidation. So the checklist item Consolidated_Cases_Noted might have no applicable values.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So if there's no indication, it should be Not Applicable. But the user needs to make sure there's no other mention.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is fully visited, and the search for \"consolidated\" was done. The matches found are all about procedural consolidation, not case consolidation. So there's no evidence of the case being consolidated with other cases. Therefore, Consolidated_Cases_Noted should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to use update_checklist to set it to Not Applicable. The evidence would be the absence of any mention of consolidation with other cases, but the policy says \"require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" Since the search found \"consolidated\" but in a different context, and no actual case consolidation is mentioned, perhaps it's safe to mark as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the search results for \"consolidated\" in the Docket (tokens 3959-4159) says: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits.\" This is procedural, not case consolidation. So there's no indication of the case being consolidated with other cases. Therefore, the key should be Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next action is to use update_checklist for Consolidated_Cases_Noted, setting it to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the search results showing that the only mentions are procedural, not case consolidation.\n\nWait, but the user needs to have evidence. The evidence should be a text snippet that shows no consolidation with other cases, but since there's no positive evidence, maybe the evidence is the absence. However, the policy states that Not Applicable must be set via update_checklist with a single entry \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence. The supporting evidence should be a text that shows it's not applicable, like a statement that the case wasn't consolidated.\n\nBut in the documents, there's no such statement. The only mentions are about procedural consolidation. So maybe the evidence is the search results showing that \"consolidated\" was used in a procedural context, not case consolidation. So the evidence can be the quote from the Docket: \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\" This shows that \"consolidated\" was used, but not in the sense of merging cases. So the evidence supports that there's no case consolidation.\n\nTherefore, the user should call update_checklist to set Consolidated_Cases_Noted to Not Applicable with that evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Entry 20 (2025-02-15), tokens 3959-4159\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Consolidated_Cases_Noted", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Entry 20 (2025-02-15), tokens 3959-4159"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 17160, "completion_tokens": 1705, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract checklist items from legal case documents. The checklist items are \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". \n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted three related case numbers (25-5025, 25-5028, 25-5052) from the Docket document. For \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", they marked it as Not Applicable based on the Docket entry mentioning consolidation with the merits under Rule 65(a)(2). \n\nWait, but I need to verify if \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" should really be Not Applicable. The checklist definition says \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" The Docket entry says \"the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits.\" But this is about consolidating the motion with the merits of the same case, not with another case. So it's not consolidation with other cases, just procedural consolidation within the same case. Therefore, the Not Applicable marking seems correct.\n\nNow, checking if all checklist items are covered. \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" has three values, all from the Docket. The Docket is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again. The other documents are partially visited or unvisited, but the related case numbers are all found in the Docket. \n\nFor \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", the evidence is from the Docket, and it's correctly marked as Not Applicable because the consolidation mentioned isn't with other cases. \n\nThe user has already done the update for Consolidated_Cases_Noted as Not Applicable. The current status shows both keys are filled: one with values, one as Not Applicable. \n\nI should check if there's any chance of missing related cases. The Docket has entries 7, 15, 34 with the USCA case numbers. Those are the only ones mentioned. The other documents might have more, but the Docket is fully read, and the related case numbers are all in there. \n\nThe extraction progress shows 3 values for Related_Cases, and Consolidated_Cases_Noted as Not Applicable. Since both keys are handled, and there's no indication of more values to extract, it's time to stop. \n\nThe system says to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable.
