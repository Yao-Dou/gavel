The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown. Since the document catalog is unknown (it's showing 0 documents), the first step should be to call list_documents to find out what documents are available.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So definitely, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action is to list the documents first. I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents exist.

The user needs to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the provided documents. The checklist item definition is pretty detailed, covering facts, evidence, and background info.\n\nFirst, I should check the current status. The system shows 15 unvisited documents, and the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" key is completely empty. The user has already done a list_documents step, so the catalog is known. No need for that again.\n\nNow, where to start reading? The complaint document is usually where the factual basis is laid out. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the first document listed, and it's 37k tokens. Since it's unvisited, reading the beginning makes sense because the complaint typically starts with the facts.\n\nThe next step is to use read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That's the maximum allowed per call. I should avoid reading the whole document at once to stay within limits. The complaint is the most likely place to find the factual basis, so targeting that first is logical.\n\nWait, the user mentioned not to reread visited documents, but this one is unvisited. So reading the first 10k tokens of the Complaint should give the initial facts. After that, if needed, I can read more sections or check other documents. But for now, the Complaint is the best bet.\n\nNo regex search needed here because the factual basis is in the complaint's narrative, not a specific pattern like a case number. So read_document is the right choice. Let me confirm the parameters: doc_name is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", start_token 0, end_token 10000. That's a valid range.\n\nI should make sure not to pick a document that's already partially visited, but all are unvisited. So proceed with reading the Complaint's first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3806, "completion_tokens": 467, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the legal documents provided. The checklist item definition says it refers to the facts or evidence supporting the case, including events, evidence, and background.\n\nLooking at the snapshot, the recent action was reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The text they provided starts with the court case details and the introduction paragraphs. Let me scan through the text to find relevant factual information.\n\nIn the Introduction section (paragraphs 1-12), there's a lot of background on NIH's role, the directives issued in February 2025, and the harm caused to plaintiffs. For example, paragraph 1 mentions NIH's role as the leading funder of biomedical research. Paragraph 2 talks about Defendants upending NIH's track record with a purge of research topics they disfavor. Paragraphs 3-4 describe Congress's mandate for NIH and the Strategic Plan. Paragraphs 5-7 detail the grant termination process and its impact, like $2.4 billion at stake.\n\nThe Factual_Basis_of_Case should capture these key points. The events (February 2025 directives), evidence (specific grants terminated, financial impact), and background (NIH's structure, congressional mandates) are all here. Each of these needs to be extracted as separate entries with evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract every distinct value. So I need to identify each factual element. Let me list them:\n\n1. NIH's role as the world's leading funder of biomedical research (para 1).\n2. Defendants' February 2025 directives to terminate grants and stop considering certain applications (para 2).\n3. Congress's mandate for NIH to fund research addressing health equity (para 3-4).\n4. The grant termination process causing $2.4 billion in losses (para 11).\n5. Specific examples of terminated grants (para 15-18, 20, 21).\n\nEach of these needs to be a separate entry with the exact text as evidence. The document name is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is the paragraph numbers or page references. Since the tokens read are 0-10000, I'll note the location as the paragraph numbers mentioned.\n\nWait, the evidence needs to have the verbatim text, source document, and location. So for each extracted value, I'll need to pull the exact quote. For example, the $2.4 billion figure is in para 11: \"Over $2.4 billion is at stake just in grants recently purged...\" So the evidence would include that quote.\n\nAlso, the plaintiffs' specific cases (Dr. Charlton, Edwards, etc.) are part of the factual basis as examples of harm. Each of their grant terminations is a factual element.\n\nSo the extracted entries should be:\n\n- Factual_Basis_of_Case value: \"NIH is the world's leading funder of biomedical and behavioral research, responsible for the discovery of new ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat diseases including cancer, strokes, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.\" Evidence: text from para 1, source \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"para 1\".\n\n- Another value: \"In late February 2025, Defendants issued directives to terminate large numbers of grants and refuse to consider certain categories of pending grant applications.\" Evidence: para 2.\n\n- Another: \"Congress created NIH nearly 100 years ago and funds it to 'improve health, revolutionize science, and serve society.'\" Para 3.\n\n- \"Over $2.4 billion is at stake just in grants recently purged, including $1.3 billion already spent on projects stopped midstream...\" Para 11.\n\n- Specific examples like Dr. Charlton's five grants terminated (para 15), Dr. Edwards' six grants (para 16), etc.\n\nWait, but the checklist says to extract distinct values. Each of these is a distinct factual element. However, the user's example in the requirements says \"When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value.\" So each of these points should be a separate entry.\n\nBut the current state shows 0 values extracted. So I need to use append_checklist to add these entries. The next action should be append_checklist with all the extracted values from the read document.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading the first 10k tokens, and the text provided includes the introduction and parts of the factual allegations. So I should extract all possible factual basis items from that text.\n\nLet me check the text again for more facts. Paragraphs 6-7 mention the termination letters citing \"no longer effectuates agency priorities\" without scientific basis. That's another factual point.\n\nAlso, paragraph 8: Defendants' campaign against research related to \"gender identity\" or DEI, etc. So that's part of the factual basis.\n\nSo compiling all these into separate entries for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nEach entry needs evidence with text, source, location. For example:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"NIH is the world's leading funder of biomedical and behavioral research, responsible for the discovery of new ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat diseases including cancer, strokes, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"The National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) is the world’s leading funder of biomedical and behavioral research, responsible for the discovery of new ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat the most challenging diseases including cancer, strokes, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n          \"location\": \"para 1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ... other entries\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the evidence should be an array of evidence objects. Each value can have multiple evidence entries, but in this case, each value is supported by one quote.\n\nSo for each fact, I'll create a separate entry in the extracted array for the key.\n\nNow, the current status shows Factual_Basis_of_Case is empty, so I need to append these values. The next action should be append_checklist with all the extracted values.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any key facts from the read text. Let's list all the relevant paragraphs:\n\n- Para 1: NIH's role\n- Para 2: February 2025 directives\n- Para 3: Congress's mandate\n- Para 4: NIH's Strategic Plan\n- Para 6: Termination without scientific basis\n- Para 7: $2.4B impact\n- Para 8: Campaign against DEI-related research\n- Para 11: Specific financial impact\n- Paras 15-18, 20, 21: Examples of plaintiffs' affected grants\n\nSo I'll create separate entries for each of these points. Each entry's value is the factual statement, and evidence is the quote.\n\nBut the checklist says \"each extracted value should be self-contained and easy to read\". So the value should be a concise statement, not the exact quote. Wait, the evidence is the quote, but the value is the extracted fact. For example, the value could be \"NIH terminated grants without scientific justification\" and evidence is the quote from para 6.\n\nWait, the example in the problem statement says \"value\" is the extracted value, and evidence is the text. So the value should be the fact, and evidence is the supporting text.\n\nSo for para 6: value = \"NIH terminated grants without referencing scientific standards, citing only that grants 'no longer effectuate agency priorities'\", evidence = the quote.\n\nSo I'll need to craft the value as the factual basis item, and evidence as the exact text.\n\nNow, to check if all these are covered in the read text. The read text goes up to para 60, so yes, the relevant parts are there.\n\nSo the next step is to append all these to the checklist. Since the current status shows 0 values, and the read document provides the necessary info, the correct action is append_checklist with the extracted values.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"NIH is the world's leading funder of biomedical and behavioral research, responsible for discoveries in diagnosing, preventing, and treating diseases including cancer, strokes, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) is the world’s leading funder of biomedical and behavioral research, responsible for the discovery of new ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat the most challenging diseases including cancer, strokes, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"para 1\"}]}, {\"value\": \"Defendants issued directives in late February 2025 to terminate large numbers of NIH grants and refuse to consider certain categories of pending grant applications\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"In late February 2025, Defendants upended NIH’s enviable track record of rigor and excellence, launching a reckless and illegal purge to stamp out NIH-funded research that addresses topics and populations that they disfavor.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"para 2\"}]}, {\"value\": \"Congress created NIH nearly 100 years ago to fund research improving health, revolutionizing science, and serving society\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Congress created NIH nearly 100 years ago and funds it through annual appropriations so that it can 'improve health, revolutionize science, and serve society.'\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"para 3\"}]}, {\"value\": \"NIH terminated grants without scientific justification, citing only that projects 'no longer effectuate agency priorities'\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"When issuing termination letters pursuant to the Directives, NIH has not referenced or met any of the standards in its governing statute or regulations.

The Complaint is fully visited (0-37398 tokens), so no need to read it again.\n\nNow, considering the checklist status: \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", \"Not Applicable: 0/1\". All keys are filled with values. The extraction progress shows 6 values for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nThe Stop Criteria state: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present... or Not Applicable\". Since all 1 key is complete (6 values extracted), and there are no empty or Not Applicable keys, I should stop.\n\nThe user's last action was `read_document` on tokens 30001-37398 of the Complaint, which completed the document. The previous `append_checklist` already added the values. Now that the document is fully read and all values extracted, there's no further action needed.\n\nSo the correct next action is to stop with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Factual_Basis_of_Case) are fully extracted with 6 values from the fully visited Complaint document.

The user has been working on extracting the Factual_Basis_of_Case checklist item from legal documents. They've already read the Complaint document in three parts (tokens 0-10000, 10001-20001, 20001-30001, and 30001-37398), and they've successfully appended 6 values for Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nThe current status shows that the Complaint document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited) with 100% coverage. The checklist status indicates that Factual_Basis_of_Case has 6 values, and there are no empty keys or Not Applicable entries. The system has already run `get_checklist` and confirmed that all keys are filled.\n\nThe user's last action was to call `stop` (Step 7), but the system automatically generated a `get_checklist` (Step 8) to verify. Now, the current status shows that all 1/1 keys are filled with 6 values, and the Complaint document is fully visited. The other documents are unvisited, but since the checklist item is already fully extracted from the Complaint, there's no need to read other documents. The requirement is to extract all applicable values, and they've got all 6 from the Complaint.\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here since the item is fully extracted. The system's instruction says to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Since Factual_Basis_of_Case is complete with 6 values, the correct action is to stop again. The system mentioned it's the first stop attempt, and they can make a second stop as final.\n\nSo the next action should be to call `stop` with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Factual_Basis_of_Case) are fully extracted with 6 values from the fully visited Complaint document.
