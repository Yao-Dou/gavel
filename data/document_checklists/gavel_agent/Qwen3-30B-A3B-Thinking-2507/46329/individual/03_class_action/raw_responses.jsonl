The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the documents in the corpus count is 0.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first.

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which requires determining if the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The main complaint document is usually where the class action status is declared. The \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" seems like the best starting point. Since it's unvisited (marked with ○), I should read it. The token count is 37,398, which is over 10k, but the system allows reading up to 10k tokens at a time. However, the user's policy says not to read more than 10k tokens per call. But since the document is unvisited, I need to start from the beginning. Wait, the system says to read a targeted window of ≤10k tokens. So I'll read the first 10k tokens of the Complaint.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all documents are unvisited, so the next step is to read a document. The Complaint is the most relevant. Let me call read_document for \"Complaint\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000. That should get the first part of the complaint where the class action status is likely mentioned.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex unless the pattern is clear. Since the key is about class action, maybe the complaint mentions \"class action\" early on. But to be safe, reading the document's beginning is better. So the correct action here is read_document on the Complaint for the first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3722, "completion_tokens": 409, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the current status has 0 values extracted for this key, which is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided document excerpt. The user read the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" from tokens 0-10000. Let me check the text for any mention of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nScanning through the complaint, in paragraph 10, it says: \"Plaintiffs are individual researchers and organizations whose members are researchers...\" Then in paragraphs 15-18, they list individual plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton, Dr. Katie Edwards, etc. The complaint also mentions organizations like APHA, Ibis, and UAW as plaintiffs.\n\nThe key here is that the complaint lists multiple individual plaintiffs (Dr. Charlton, Edwards, Lurie, Maphis) along with organizational plaintiffs. The checklist item requires specifying whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The complaint doesn't explicitly say \"class action\" anywhere. Instead, it lists specific individuals and organizations as plaintiffs. The language used is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the checklist definition: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since the complaint lists specific individuals (e.g., \"Plaintiff Dr. Brittany Charlton\"), this is clearly individual plaintiffs, not a class action.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list of individuals and organizations]\". The evidence needs to include the verbatim text. The relevant parts are paragraphs 10-19, which list the individual plaintiffs and the organizations.\n\nThe document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but the relevant info is in the first part. The next step is to use append_checklist to add this value with the evidence. The evidence should include the text snippets where the plaintiffs are listed, the document name, and location (page or token range).\n\nWait, the current action history shows they read the first 10,000 tokens, and the text provided includes the plaintiff descriptions. So the evidence can be taken from the text they already read. Therefore, I should call append_checklist with the extracted value and the evidence from the document.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: must have text (verbatim snippet), source_document, location. The location here would be the token range read (0-10000) or specific page numbers if available. Since the document is token-based, using the token range makes sense.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Dr. Brittany Charlton, Dr. Katie Edwards, Dr. Peter Lurie, Dr. Nicole Maphis, American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\".\n\nWait, the checklist says \"described as [description]\". The description should be the list of plaintiffs. The text in the complaint lists them, so the evidence needs to cite the specific paragraphs where they are named.\n\nThe evidence entries should include the verbatim text snippets. For example, the text in paragraph 15-18 lists the individuals. So the evidence should have those snippets.\n\nBut the user needs to create a single extracted entry with the value and multiple evidence entries (each with text, source, location). Wait, the evidence field is an array of evidence objects. Each evidence object has text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for this value, the evidence would include the relevant parts of the complaint where the plaintiffs are listed. For example, the text from paragraph 15: \"Plaintiff Dr. Brittany Charlton is an Associate Professor...\" and similar for the others. But the user can't include all of them in one evidence entry; they should have separate evidence entries for each mention or a summary.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list]\", and the evidence should include the text that supports this, like the list of plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the complaint, the plaintiffs are listed in the caption: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\" followed by \"Plaintiffs.\"\n\nSo the key evidence is the caption listing all the plaintiffs. The caption says \"Plaintiffs,\" followed by the list. So the evidence text could be the caption line.\n\nIn the document excerpt, the caption is:\n\n\"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH   \nASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE   \nHEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION,   \nUNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE,   \nAND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT  Case No. __________ \nWORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY   \nCHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER   \nLURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\"\n\nSo the evidence text is that line, source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location is \"Caption\" or \"tokens 0-10000\".\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist should have the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", extracted value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\", with evidence including the caption text.\n\nWait, the value should be formatted as \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description is the list of plaintiffs. So the value string is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as American Public Health Association; Ibis Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); Brittany Charlton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; and Nicole Maphis\".\n\nBut the evidence needs to cite the text where this is stated. The caption has the list, so the evidence text would be the caption line.\n\nIn the document, the caption is split into multiple lines, but the full list is there. So the evidence text should be the exact text from the document, which includes all the plaintiffs.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have text: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\", source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"Caption (tokens 0-10000)\".\n\nThen, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [the list]\".\n\nWait, but the value should be the full string. So the value field in the extracted entry is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as American Public Health Association; Ibis Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); Brittany Charlton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; and Nicole Maphis\".\n\nBut the description in the evidence's text is the exact list from the document, which is slightly different (e.g., \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION\" vs. \"American Public Health Association\"). However, the evidence text should be verbatim, so the value's description should use the exact terms from the document.\n\nWait, the value is a string that's formatted as per the checklist. The checklist says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The [description] should be the list of plaintiffs as they appear in the document. So the description part should mirror the document's text.\n\nIn the document, the plaintiffs are listed as \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; ...\". So the description should include those exact terms.\n\nTherefore, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\".\n\nBut note that the document has \"BRITTANY CHARLTON\" in all caps, so the value should reflect that.\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text. So the evidence text would be the exact line from the document where the plaintiffs are listed, which is the caption.\n\nSo the evidence object would have text: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\", source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"Caption\".\n\nBut since the document is token-based, location might be \"tokens 0-10000\" as that's where it was read.\n\nNow, the next action after reading the document is to append the checklist item. So the correct tool to use here is append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted value with evidence.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is the string above. The evidence array has one entry with the text, source, and location.\n\nWait, the evidence field is an array, but in this case, one evidence entry suffices. So the extracted array will have one entry with the value and the evidence array.\n\nSo the patch should be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n          \"location\": \"Caption (tokens 0-10000)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the location should be the token range. The document was read from 0-10000, so location is \"tokens 0-10000\".\n\nAlso, check if the value is correctly formatted. The checklist requires \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description here is the list, so it's correct.\n\nNow, the user's recent action was read_document on the complaint, so the next step is to append the checklist with the found value.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the patch as above.\n\nNo need to use update_checklist here because this is the first value, and it's appending. The checklist key was empty, so appending the first entry.\n\nAlso, confirm that there's no mention of \"class action\" anywhere. The complaint lists individual plaintiffs, so it's not a class action. The value is correctly \"Individual\".\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Caption (tokens 0-10000)\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS", "evidence": [{"text": "AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Caption (tokens 0-10000)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14350, "completion_tokens": 2824, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to specify whether plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 already appended the value from the Complaint document. The value extracted is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\". The evidence is from the caption of the Complaint.\n\nNow, the current status shows that 1 key has 1 value, and there are no empty keys or Not Applicable. The task is to extract every distinct value. The user mentioned that each unique value should be a separate entry with evidence.\n\nWait, but the current extracted value is for individual plaintiffs. The checklist item requires the format \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The extracted value matches the individual format. But I need to check if there are other documents that might have additional values or confirm if this is the only one.\n\nThe available documents list includes the Complaint (partially read), and 14 other documents that are unvisited. The Complaint's caption clearly lists the plaintiffs as individuals and organizations, not a class action. The question is, are there other documents that might indicate a class action?\n\nThe next step is to verify if all necessary documents have been checked. The Complaint was partially read (0-10000 tokens), but the document has 37,398 tokens. However, the key information about the plaintiffs is in the caption, which was covered in the first 10,000 tokens. The rest of the document might not have more info on the class action status.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe check if other documents like the Docket or other pleadings mention class action status. However, the user's instructions say not to reread fully visited documents. The Complaint is partially visited, but the relevant part was read. The other documents are unvisited, so maybe I should check if any of them contain the class action status.\n\nWait, the checklist item is specifically about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individuals. The Complaint's caption lists the plaintiffs as individuals (with organizations), so it's individual. But maybe other documents, like the Motion for Preliminary Injunction or other pleadings, might clarify if this is a class action.\n\nBut the user's previous action (Step 3) already extracted the value from the Complaint. The current status shows that the key is filled. However, the user might need to confirm if there are other values. But according to the evidence, the plaintiffs are listed as individuals, so it's not a class action. The checklist item is to extract the status, so if it's individual, that's the value.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". So if all documents confirm it's individual, then only that value exists. But maybe some documents might say it's a class action. However, the Complaint's caption is the primary document, and it lists the plaintiffs as specific individuals and organizations. In legal terms, when a case is filed by multiple individuals or organizations without a class certification, it's not a class action. So the status here is individual.\n\nThe current extraction has one value. The task is to make sure that's the only value. Since the Complaint's caption is the first document read, and it's the complaint, which typically lists the plaintiffs, and it's a list of individuals/orgs, it's safe to assume that's the status.\n\nNow, checking the available documents: the other documents are Docket, Orders, Briefs, etc. The Docket might have the case type, but the user's recent action already extracted the value. The system says \"all checklist items\" and the current key is filled. The next step would be to confirm if there's any other value.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, the only key is filled. So maybe the next action is to stop. Wait, but the system says to use get_checklist to assess remaining gaps before stopping. Wait, the Stop Criteria say: \"Before stopping, verify state with get_checklist (in a prior turn if needed) and, if consolidation is required, issue one final update_checklist... Then return the stop decision.\"\n\nBut the current status shows that the key is filled, so maybe a get_checklist would confirm that. However, the user's previous actions already have the value. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Stop only when every checklist key is either Complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut the user's last action was append_checklist, which added the value. Now, the checklist summary shows that the key is filled. So the assistant should issue a stop decision.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to use get_checklist before stopping to verify. However, the current status already shows it's filled. But to be safe, maybe call get_checklist to confirm. However, the problem is that the user's current step is Step 4, and the previous steps have already extracted the value. The available documents include the Complaint which was partially read, but the relevant info was in the caption, which was read.\n\nWait, the Complaint was read from 0-10000 tokens, and the caption is in the beginning. So the evidence is valid. Therefore, the key is complete. The next action should be to stop.\n\nBut let me check the Stop Criteria again. It says \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is filled, so stop.\n\nBut the user's recent action history shows that after Step 3, the key has 1 value. So the correct next action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.
