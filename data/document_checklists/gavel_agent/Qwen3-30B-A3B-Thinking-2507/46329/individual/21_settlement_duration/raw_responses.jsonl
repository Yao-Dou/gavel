The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the first function to call here is list_documents. There's no need to read or search any documents yet because there are none to read. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system needs to discover them first.

The task is to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the provided documents. The user has already listed 15 documents, all unvisited. The checklist item requires extracting settlement duration obligations that aren't part of a court order.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain settlement terms. Settlements are usually mentioned in pleadings, motions, or orders related to settlements. The \"Complaint\" and \"Docket\" might have some info, but the \"Stipulated Protective Order\" and \"Memorandum\" documents are more likely to have settlement details. Wait, the \"Stipulated Protective Order\" is about confidentiality, not settlement duration. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the document list, there's a \"Stipulated Protective Order\" but that's probably not relevant. The \"Memorandum of Points and Authorities\" for Defendants' Motion to Dismiss might not have settlement terms. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" could mention settlement discussions. Wait, but the key is to find settlement durations not incorporated into court orders. So maybe the settlement is in a separate agreement, like a stipulation or a settlement agreement document. But the available documents don't have a \"Settlement Agreement\" listed. The \"Stipulated Protective Order\" is a type of stipulation, but it's about confidentiality. \n\nWait, the checklist says \"only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order.\" So if a settlement is part of a court order, it's excluded. So maybe the settlement terms are in a separate stipulation or agreement. The \"Stipulated Protective Order\" might have some settlement terms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the \"Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" mentions a settlement.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to use the most efficient method. Since all documents are unvisited, the next step is to decide which document to read first. The \"Complaint\" might not have settlement terms because it's the initial filing. The \"Docket\" is a log of court actions, so maybe it lists settlement dates. But the Docket is 22k tokens, which is a bit long, but maybe the relevant info is near the beginning. Alternatively, using a regex search might be better to find terms like \"settlement\", \"duration\", \"monitoring period\", etc.\n\nThe checklist item's example format is \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\", so looking for phrases like \"settlement will last 3 years\" or \"monitoring period of 2 years\". So using a regex search for patterns like \"settlement.*?duration|settlement.*?period|settlement.*?monitoring\" might help. But the regex should be precise to avoid false positives.\n\nThe available tools include search_document_regex, which can search all documents. Let's set up a regex pattern to find settlement duration terms. The pattern could be something like r'settlement\\s+.*?\\b(duration|period|monitoring)\\b' with IGNORECASE. But need to make sure it's anchored to find the actual duration. However, the user's example says to extract the duration as a separate value, so maybe the regex should capture the duration phrase.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex tool allows specifying a pattern. Let's try a pattern like r'settlement.*?(?:duration|period|monitoring).*?(\\d+\\s*[\\w\\s]+)' to capture the duration part. But maybe it's better to use a simpler pattern first, like \"settlement duration\" or \"settlement period\" to find relevant sections.\n\nGiven that the documents are unvisited, using search_document_regex with a pattern that matches settlement duration terms would be efficient to locate the relevant parts without reading the entire documents. The top_k parameter can return the top matches, and then I can read the specific sections.\n\nSo the next action should be to use search_document_regex with a pattern targeting settlement duration. The pattern could be \"settlement duration|settlement period|settlement monitoring\" to find those terms. Let's set the pattern to \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\" to match those terms. Using IGNORECASE since case might vary.\n\nThe parameters would be: pattern=\"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\", doc_name=\"all\", top_k=5, context_tokens=200. This will search all documents for those phrases and return the top matches with context.\n\nThis way, I can find the relevant parts without having to read all documents. Once I get the matches, I can then read the specific sections using read_document if needed, but the search should narrow it down.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"settlement\\\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3731, "completion_tokens": 1037, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is trying to extract the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" item from legal documents. They've already done a search using a regex for \"settlement duration\" or similar terms, but found zero matches. Now they need to figure out the next step.\n\nFirst, the current status shows that all 15 documents are unvisited. The search didn't find anything, so maybe the term they used isn't the right one. The checklist definition says to look for settlement durations not incorporated into court orders. The regex pattern was \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\", but maybe the actual documents use different phrasing. For example, maybe they say \"settlement period\" but the regex used \"period\" which might not match because of word boundaries. Wait, the regex uses \\s+ so maybe \"settlement period\" would match. But the search returned 0 matches, so perhaps the documents don't use those exact terms.\n\nSince the regex search didn't work, the next step should be to read some documents manually. The user needs to check documents that are likely to contain settlement terms. The Complaint might have settlement terms, but usually complaints are the initial filing. The Pleading/Motion/Brief documents, like the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, might mention settlement discussions. Also, the Stipulated Protective Order could have settlement-related clauses.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is 37k tokens, which is too big to read all at once. The user should pick a document that's more likely to have settlement info. The Stipulated Protective Order (3,843 tokens) is a good candidate because protective orders often include settlement terms. Or maybe the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (35k tokens), but that's a big document. The Order/Opinion documents might have settlement terms if they're about a settlement, but the search didn't find matches there.\n\nWait, the previous search was on all documents with a regex, but maybe the regex wasn't precise. The regex used \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\" which might not catch variations like \"settlement duration\" or \"settlement period\" if there's a typo or different phrasing. But since the search returned zero matches, the actual documents might not have those exact terms. So maybe the settlement duration is mentioned in a different way, like \"the parties agree to a settlement period of 2 years\" or similar.\n\nSince the search didn't find anything, the next logical step is to read a document that's most likely to contain settlement-related terms. The Stipulated Protective Order is a common document where settlement terms might be included, especially if it's a stipulated order related to a settlement. So reading that document's entire content (or a large chunk) makes sense. The Stipulated Protective Order is 3,843 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the Memorandum of Points and Authorities might discuss settlement terms in the context of motions. But the Stipulated Protective Order is more directly related to settlement terms. So the best action is to call read_document on the Stipulated Protective Order document, starting at token 0, ending at 3843. That way, they can check the entire document for any mentions of settlement duration, even if the regex didn't catch it.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Stipulated Protective Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3843}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Stipulated Protective Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3843}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3772, "completion_tokens": 767, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which needs to be the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 15 documents. Step 2 was a regex search for \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\" across all documents, but it found 0 matches. Step 3 was reading the Stipulated Protective Order, which was fully visited (tokens 0-3843), but the text provided doesn't mention settlement duration. The document is about protective orders for confidential information, not settlement terms.\n\nNow, the current status shows 0 values extracted for the key. The available documents include other types like Complaints, Dockets, Memorandums, etc. Since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe the term is phrased differently. The Stipulated Protective Order was read, but it's not relevant. The next step should be to check other documents that might contain settlement terms.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is unvisited. Complaints often outline the claims but might not have settlement terms. However, sometimes settlements are mentioned in the context of proposed resolutions. But the regex search didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't \"duration\" or \"period\" but something else like \"term\" or \"obligations\".\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments.\" So, it's about negotiated settlements, not court orders. The Stipulated Protective Order is a court order, so it's not relevant. The Complaint might not have settlement terms, but maybe the Motion for Preliminary Injunction or other briefs do.\n\nThe next logical step is to search for other terms related to settlement duration. The regex used before was specific, but maybe it's better to try a broader search. However, the tool's search_document_regex allows specifying patterns. The previous pattern was \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\", but maybe the actual term is \"settlement term\" or \"settlement period\". Let's adjust the pattern to \"settlement\\s+term|settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|monitoring\\s+period\".\n\nBut the problem is, the previous regex search was done on all documents and found 0 matches. So maybe the term isn't there, or the documents don't contain it. However, the Complaint or other pleadings might have settlement terms. Wait, the Complaint is for declaratory and injunctive relief, which might not include settlement terms yet, as the case is ongoing. Settlements usually come after some negotiation, maybe in a motion or a stipulation.\n\nWait, the Stipulated Protective Order was a stipulation, but it's about protective orders, not settlement. The \"Stipulated\" part might be a hint. But the document doesn't mention settlement duration. So maybe the settlement terms are in another document.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might have settlement terms if they're proposing a settlement as part of the motion. But typically, a preliminary injunction is about immediate relief, not settlement. The \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might have some details.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Brief of Amici Curiae\" might mention settlement terms, but that's less likely. The \"Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay\" might reference a settlement agreement.\n\nBut since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe the term is phrased differently. Let's try a more general regex. For example, \"settlement.*?duration|settlement.*?term|settlement.*?period\" but the tool's regex might need to be precise.\n\nWait, the tool's search_document_regex allows specifying a pattern. The previous search used \"settlement\\s+(?:duration|period|monitoring)\" which is looking for \"settlement\" followed by a space and then one of those words. Maybe the actual text uses \"settlement duration\" without a space, but that's unlikely. Or maybe it's \"settlement term\" instead of \"settlement duration\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the settlement duration is mentioned in the context of a specific clause. Since the regex search didn't find anything, perhaps the next step is to read a document that's likely to contain settlement terms. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" (35,646 tokens) is a large document, but maybe the settlement terms are in there. However, the user's instructions say to avoid reading fully visited documents and to read only unvisited ones. The Complaint is unvisited, so maybe start with that.\n\nWait, the available documents list shows \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" as unvisited. But complaints usually don't have settlement terms; they're the initial filing. Settlements are more likely in later documents like stipulations, motions to settle, or proposed settlements. The \"Stipulated Protective Order\" was read, but it's not about settlement. The \"Order\" or \"Memorandum and Order\" might have settlement terms, but the regex search didn't find them.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if a settlement is part of a court order, it's excluded. So the settlement terms must be in a separate agreement, like a stipulation or settlement agreement.\n\nLooking at the document list, there's a \"Stipulated Protective Order\" but that's not a settlement agreement. Maybe there's another stipulation or settlement agreement. The document names don't indicate that. The \"Complaint\" is a complaint, \"Docket\" is the court's record, \"Findings of Fact...\" is an order. The \"Brief of Amici\" is a brief, which might not have settlement terms.\n\nWait, the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might include a proposed settlement as part of the motion, but usually, a motion for preliminary injunction is seeking immediate relief, not a settlement. However, sometimes parties might file a motion to settle, but the name here is \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction,\" so it's probably not about settlement.\n\nHmm. Since the regex search didn't find anything, and the Stipulated Protective Order (which was read) doesn't have it, maybe the settlement duration is not present in the documents. But the task requires extracting all applicable items. If there's no evidence of settlement duration, then it should be marked as Not Applicable. But the Not Applicable encoding requires explicit evidence.\n\nWait, the Not Applicable must be set via update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" as the value. But to set it, we need evidence that the item doesn't apply. For example, if the case is still ongoing and no settlement has been reached, or the documents don't mention any settlement terms.\n\nIn this case, the documents read so far (Stipulated Protective Order) don't mention settlement duration, and the regex search found nothing. The Complaint is about declaratory and injunctive relief, which suggests the case is in early stages, possibly no settlement yet. So maybe the settlement duration is Not Applicable.\n\nBut the problem is, the system requires that Not Applicable must have supporting evidence. The evidence should be explicit, like \"no settlement has been reached\" or \"the case is ongoing with no settlement terms.\" The current documents don't have that. The Stipulated Protective Order is a court order, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments.\" So if there's no negotiated agreement (i.e., the case is still pending without a settlement), then the item would be Not Applicable.\n\nBut how to confirm that? The Complaint is a filing that says the plaintiffs are seeking relief, but it doesn't state that there's no settlement. The Docket might have entries showing the case is ongoing. But the Docket document is unvisited. Maybe the Docket shows that the case is still active, so no settlement has been reached yet.\n\nThe Docket document (22,978 tokens) might have the status of the case. For example, if the docket shows \"Case pending\" or \"Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed,\" then that implies no settlement yet. So, if we read the Docket, we might find evidence that the case is still ongoing, hence no settlement duration to extract.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document to check for case status. Since it's unvisited, and the Docket might contain information about the case being active, which would support \"Not Applicable.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the regex search didn't find settlement terms, and the only document read so far is a protective order (not settlement-related), maybe the correct action is to set the key to Not Applicable. But according to the rules, you can't mark it as Not Applicable without explicit evidence. So we need to find evidence that there's no settlement.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to read the Docket to see if it indicates the case is ongoing without a settlement. So, the next action should be `read_document` on the Docket, starting at token 0.\n\nWait, the Docket is listed as unvisited, so reading it would be the next logical step. The Docket might have entries like \"Case filed,\" \"Motion filed,\" \"No settlement reached,\" etc. If it shows that the case is still pending, that supports Not Applicable.\n\nSo, the correct action now is to call `read_document` on the Docket document, tokens 0-10000 (since it's 22,978 tokens, but max 10,000 per call).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7964, "completion_tokens": 2156, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The next step would be to search again with a more comprehensive regex, but the policy says to avoid broad patterns. Alternatively, read a document that's likely to contain settlement terms.\n\nThe document \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might have settlement terms, but preliminary injunctions are about temporary orders, not settlements. Settlements usually happen later. The \"Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" might not have settlement terms either.

So if all documents are checked and no value is found, then it's Not Applicable. However, the user hasn't checked all documents yet.

The remaining tokens are 10000-22978. Maybe the settlement terms are in the later part of the Docket.\n\nAlternatively, the Stipulated Protective Order was fully read, and the Docket is partially read. The next logical step is to read the remaining tokens of the Docket (10000-22978) to check for any settlement terms. The Docket is a likely place because it's the case's chronological record, and settlement might be mentioned in later entries.\n\nSo the next action should be to call read_document on Docket with start_token 10000 and end_token 22978 (since max 10,000 tokens, but the remaining is 12,978, so split into two reads? Wait, the max is 10,000 tokens per call. The remaining tokens after 10000 are 12,978 (22978-10000=12978). So first read from 10000 to 20000, then another read for 20000-22978.\n\nBut the user's current state says the Docket is partially visited with tokens 0-10000. So the next read should be from 10000 to 20000. So the correct action is read_document for Docket, start_token 10000, end_token 20000.\n\nWait, the problem says \"NEVER reread token ranges already viewed.\" So they need to read the unviewed part. The Docket has 22,978 tokens, viewed 0-10000, so next is 10000-20000. The max per call is 10,000, so 10000-20000 is 10,000 tokens (since end_token is exclusive).

The available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" which is 37k tokens, unvisited. But the complaint is about seeking relief, not settlement. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might not have settlement terms either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the settlement duration is in the \"Stipulated Protective Order\" but the user didn't see it. Let me recheck the Stipulated Protective Order text. The user provided the text from tokens 0-3843. The text is about confidentiality of documents, redaction, non-disclosure obligations. No mention of settlement duration.\n\nThe Docket entries (tokens 0-20000) have entries like \"Stipulated Protective Order\" (doc 120), but the actual order text was read in Step 3. The Docket entries themselves don't mention settlement duration.\n\nSo, perhaps there are no documents containing the settlement duration. But the user needs to confirm by checking other documents. However, the regex search didn't find anything, and the two documents read don't have it. The next step might be to check other documents, but the user can't read all at once. The most likely document to contain settlement terms would be the \"Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment\" or the \"Findings of Fact\" document.\n\nWait, the \"Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment\" is listed as a document. The user should read that. But since it's unvisited, they can use read_document on it. The maximum token range is 10,000 tokens, so they can read the whole thing (1,667 tokens is under 10k).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the settlement duration is not present, so they should mark it as Not Applicable. But they need to be sure. The instructions say to mark as Not Applicable only if explicitly stated. Since the regex search found nothing, and the documents read don't have it, maybe it's safe to set it as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't read all documents yet. They've read two out of 15. The other 13 are unvisited. However, the regex search was done on all documents and found 0 matches. So the regex search would have checked all documents for the pattern. If the regex found 0 matches, then there's no document containing \"settlement duration\" etc. So maybe it's safe to conclude it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut the problem says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if the settlement is part of a court order, it's excluded. But if there's no settlement at all, then the item is Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item is to extract the duration of settlement obligations. If there are no settlement obligations (i.e., the case is still ongoing, no settlement was reached), then it's Not Applicable. But the case seems to have a partial final judgment (doc 138), which might imply a settlement. Wait, doc 138 is a \"RULE 54(b) PARTIAL FINAL JUDGMENT\" entered on 06/23/2025. The judgment vacated the directives, so maybe it's a court order, not a settlement. The settlement duration would be for negotiated agreements, not court orders.\n\nSo, if the case is resolved via court order (the judgment), not a settlement, then the settlement duration is Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm that there's no settlement agreement. The documents might not mention a settlement, only the court judgment. So, since the regex search found no \"settlement duration\" and the judgment is a court order, not a settlement, the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to use update_checklist to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence.\n\nBut wait, the evidence needs to be explicit. The evidence should state why it's Not Applicable. For example, \"The case was resolved via court order (Doc 138), not a settlement agreement, so settlement duration is not applicable.\"\n\nSo, the evidence would be from the judgment entry. Doc 138 is the Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment, which is a court order, not a settlement. Therefore, the settlement duration doesn't apply.\n\nThus, the correct action is to update_checklist with the Not Applicable entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"138 | 2025-06-23 | Judge William G.
