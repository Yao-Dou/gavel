The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain the filing date. The Complaint is usually where the filing date is mentioned, as it's the initial document. The Docket might also have it since dockets list court events. The other documents like motions or orders might not have the original filing date.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the primary document to check. The Docket is also a good candidate. The user has 15 documents, all unvisited. The Complaint is 37k tokens, which is a bit big, but the filing date is probably near the beginning. So I should read the first part of the Complaint.\n\nWait, the decision policy says to avoid rereading visited documents, but none are visited yet. So I should use read_document on the Complaint. The start_token should be 0, and end_token maybe 10,000 to get the first chunk. That's within the 10k token limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for a date pattern. But the user's example says to use regex when it's clearly patternable. Dates can be in various formats, so a regex might work. But since the Complaint is the most likely place, reading the first part might be more efficient. The regex could be something like \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4} but might have false positives. However, the instructions say to use regex for patternable targets. Let's see.\n\nWait, the current step is Step 2, and the previous step was list_documents. The user has to choose between read_document and search_document_regex. The Complaint is the most probable document, so reading it makes sense. Let's go with read_document on the Complaint, starting from 0 to 10,000 tokens. That way, we can check the beginning where the filing date is usually listed.\n\nI need to make sure not to read beyond 10k tokens. The Complaint is 37k, so reading 0-10k is safe. Then, after reading, check the text for the date. If found, append it. If not, maybe check the Docket next. But for now, the first action should be to read the Complaint's first part.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3672, "completion_tokens": 575, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status, and the recent actions.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any document that might contain the filing date. The recent action was reading the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from tokens 0-10000. The user provided the text from that document.\n\nLooking at the text, the Complaint starts with \"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" followed by the case number \"Case No. __________\". But there's no actual date mentioned here. The case number is blank, so that's not helpful. The document mentions dates like \"late February 2025\" in paragraph 2, but that's the date of the Defendants' actions, not the filing date of the lawsuit.\n\nWait, the Filing_Date is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed. The Complaint might have the filing date in the caption or somewhere else. Let me check the provided text again.\n\nThe text shows \"Case No. __________\" which is a placeholder. The actual filing date might be in the docket or another document. The current document (Complaint) hasn't provided the date yet. The next step is to check if other documents might have the filing date. The available documents include a Docket, which typically lists the filing date. The Docket document is currently unvisited (○ Unvisited), so it's a good candidate.\n\nThe user's recent action was reading the Complaint, but the filing date isn't in that text. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document, which is more likely to contain the filing date. The Docket is listed as 22,978 tokens, and it's unvisited. Since the user can read up to 10,000 tokens at a time, I should call read_document on the Docket, starting from tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, the decision policy says to choose a specific document likely to contain the target value. The Docket is the most probable place for the filing date. So the next action should be read_document for the Docket document, tokens 0-10000. That's the correct step here.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14300, "completion_tokens": 527, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. So far, the user has done two steps: listed documents and read the Complaint and Docket.\n\nLooking at the Docket document (tokens 0-10000), there's a line that says \"1 | 2025-04-02 | COMPLAINT For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against All Defendants Filing fee: $ 405, receipt number AMADC-10928559 (Fee Status: Filing Fee paid), filed by American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, United Auto Workers, Brittany Charlton, Katie Edwards, Peter Lurie, Nicole Maphis.

(Entered: 04/02/2025)\".\n\nSo the filing date here is 2025-04-02. That's the date the complaint was filed. The document mentions \"Entered: 04/02/2025\", which probably refers to the date the complaint was entered into the docket, which is the filing date.\n\nThe Complaint document (the first one read) doesn't have a clear date in the text provided. The Docket entry explicitly states the filing date as 2025-04-02. So the Filing_Date should be extracted from the Docket.\n\nNow, checking the evidence requirements: need verbatim snippet, source document, location. The verbatim part is \"2025-04-02\" in the Docket entry. The source document is \"Docket\", and location is the first entry (Docket entry 1) where it says \"COMPLAINT For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief... filed by... (Entered: 04/02/2025)\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"2025-04-02\", with evidence from the Docket document, entry 1. Since this is the only filing date found, and it's explicitly stated, we should append this to the checklist.\n\nThe checklist item Filing_Date is currently empty. So the next action should be to append the checklist with this value. The function to use is append_checklist, adding the extracted value with the evidence details.\n\nWait, the Docket document was partially read (tokens 0-10000), and the entry is within that range. The user read the first 10k tokens, which includes the entry. So the evidence is correctly found.\n\nNo need for regex search here since the date is clearly present in the Docket.

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done steps 1-4, and in step 4, they appended the Filing_Date with the value \"2025-04-02\" from the Docket entry 1.\n\nLooking at the current status, there's one key (Filing_Date) with one value. The documents available include the Complaint and Docket, which have been partially read. The Docket's first 10,000 tokens were read, and the Complaint's first 10,000 tokens were read. The Docket entry 1 clearly states the filing date as 2025-04-02.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other documents that might have additional filing dates. The checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So, the first filing date is what's needed. The Docket entry 1 is the complaint filing, which should be the initial filing date.\n\nThe other documents like Orders, Briefs, etc., are probably subsequent filings, not the initial one. The Complaint itself might have the date, but the Docket entry 1 already provided the date. The Complaint document's text shows \"Case No. __________\" but doesn't have the filing date in the excerpt provided. The Docket entry 1 is the official record of the filing.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 1 says \"1 | 2025-04-02 | COMPLAINT For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against All Defendants Filing fee: $ 405, receipt number AMADC-10928559 (Fee Status: Filing Fee paid), filed by American Public Health Association...\" So that's the filing date.\n\nSince the Filing_Date is the date the lawsuit was first filed, and the Docket entry 1 is the first document (Complaint), that's the correct date. There's no indication of another filing date elsewhere. The other documents in the docket are subsequent events (like notices, motions, etc.), so their dates aren't the filing date.\n\nThe user's current status shows that Filing_Date has one value, and all other keys are empty. But the checklist only has Filing_Date as the item to extract. So once that's filled, the task is done. The system says to stop when all applicable checklist items are extracted.\n\nWait, the checklist only specifies Filing_Date. So if that's correctly extracted, there are no other items. The user's step 4 already appended Filing_Date with the correct value from the Docket. The next step should be to check if there's anything else to extract, but since there's only one item and it's filled, the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut wait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key, Filing_Date, which is now filled. So the next action is to stop. The user has already appended the value, so no more actions are needed.\n\nThe system's Stop Criteria says to stop when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable. Here, Filing_Date is complete with one value. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Filing_Date) have been fully extracted with evidence.
