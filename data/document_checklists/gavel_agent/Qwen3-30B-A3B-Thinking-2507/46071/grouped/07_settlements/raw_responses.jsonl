The available actions include `list_documents`, which is the first step when the catalog is unknown. Since the system hasn't found any documents yet, the correct action here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the decision policy: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" The current state shows \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the next step must be to list the documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents exist.

The user needs to extract five checklist items from legal documents. The current status shows all keys are empty, and all documents are unvisited. The first step after listing documents (which was done in Step 1) is to start reading documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" seems most relevant because it's a settlement-related document. The other documents like Complaint, Docket, Order, etc., might have related info, but the Stipulation is directly about a dismissal, which might include settlement terms.\n\nThe checklist items include Significant Terms of Settlement, Date of Settlement, etc. A stipulation for dismissal often includes settlement terms, so that's a good place to start. The document is only 787 tokens, so reading the whole thing is feasible without exceeding the 10k token limit.\n\nSince the document is unvisited, using read_document on \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" with start_token 0 and end_token 787 makes sense. That should give the full content to extract the necessary info. No need for regex here because the document name suggests it's directly relevant.

The user needs me to extract all 5 checklist items from the legal case documents. The current status shows all keys are empty, and the only document read so far is the Stipulation for Dismissal, which is fully visited.\n\nLooking at the Stipulation for Dismissal text, I need to check if any of the checklist items can be found there. The document is a stipulation for dismissal with prejudice. The key part is the first paragraph: \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe and Defendants ... hereby stipulate to the dismissal of this action with prejudice and without attorneys’ fees or costs to either party.\"\n\nFor **Date_of_Settlement**, the document says \"Dated: December 20, 2024\". So that's the date. The format should be '[date]: [settlement]'. Here, the settlement is the dismissal with prejudice, so the extracted value would be \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\".\n\n**Significant_Terms_of_Settlement** might be the \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"without attorneys’ fees or costs\". So the terms are dismissal with prejudice and no fees/costs. But the checklist item says \"substantive obligations\", so the dismissal terms. Need to check if those are the terms.\n\n**Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not**: The stipulation is filed with the court, so it's a consent decree? Wait, the document says \"Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\", which is for voluntary dismissal. But dismissal with prejudice is a court order. Wait, the stipulation is for dismissal, and it's filed with the court. So the settlement (dismissal) is court-enforced because it's part of the court's order. So the answer would be \"Yes\".\n\n**How_Long_Settlement_will_Last**: The document doesn't mention a duration. It's a dismissal, so the settlement (dismissal) is immediate. No duration terms. So maybe \"Not Applicable\" here. But need to check if there's any duration mentioned. The text says \"dismissal with prejudice\", which is permanent, so the duration would be \"permanent\" or \"indefinite\". But the checklist says \"duration terms\", so maybe \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\". But the example format is '[duration]: [settlement]'. So \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\".\n\n**Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement**: The document doesn't mention any disputes. It's a stipulation, so both parties agree. No disputes mentioned. So this might be \"Not Applicable\", but need to check if there's any indication of disputes. The document is a stipulation for dismissal, so no disputes over enforcement. So perhaps Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say not to mark as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. Since the document is a stipulation without any disputes, maybe it's safe to say there's no disputes, so \"Not Applicable\" with evidence.\n\nBut let's check each item again.\n\nDate_of_Settlement: \"Dated: December 20, 2024\" → extracted as \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\".\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Settlement: The terms are \"dismissal with prejudice and without attorneys’ fees or costs to either party.\" So the terms are the dismissal with prejudice and no fees/costs. Need to split into separate entries? The checklist says \"every distinct value\", so maybe two entries: \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys' fees or costs\". But the example in the checklist says \"substantive obligations\", so maybe both are part of the terms. Wait, the checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\", so the terms themselves. The text says \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"without attorneys’ fees or costs\". So two terms. But the user's example in the checklist says \"the substantive obligations agreed to\", so both are obligations. So two entries.\n\nBut the extracted value should be the terms, so \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys' fees or costs\". Wait, but the format for the Date is [date]: [settlement], but for Significant_Terms, it's just the terms. So the value would be \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys' fees or costs\".\n\nWait, the checklist definitions:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: \"The substantive obligations agreed to in any settlement—what the parties agree to do or refrain from doing.\"\n\nSo the obligations here are: dismiss the case with prejudice (they agree to dismiss), and no fees/costs (they agree not to charge each other fees). So two terms.\n\nBut the user's example for Date_of_Settlement uses the format '[date]: [settlement]', but for Significant_Terms, it's just the terms. So each term is a separate entry.\n\nSo for Significant_Terms, two extracted entries: \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys’ fees or costs\".\n\nBut wait, the document says \"dismissal with prejudice and without attorneys’ fees or costs\". So it's a single sentence, but two separate terms. So two entries.\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: The settlement is dismissal with prejudice, which is permanent. So the duration is \"permanent\". So the extracted value would be \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\".\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: Since it's a stipulation filed with the court, and it's a dismissal with prejudice, which requires court approval, it's court-enforced. So \"Yes\".\n\nDisputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: No mention of disputes. The stipulation is mutual, so no disputes. So this should be \"Not Applicable\", but need evidence. The evidence would be that the document is a mutual stipulation for dismissal, so no disputes mentioned. So the Not Applicable entry would have evidence: \"Stipulation for Dismissal states mutual agreement without disputes.\"\n\nNow, the document is fully visited, so I can't read it again. The next step is to append the extracted values to the checklist.\n\nSo for each key:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: two entries: \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys’ fees or costs\".\n- Date_of_Settlement: \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\"\n- How_Long_Settlement_will_Last: \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\"\n- Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: \"Yes\"\n- Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: \"Not Applicable\"\n\nWait, but for Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement, the value is \"Not Applicable\", which must be set via update_checklist as a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\".\n\nSo need to use update_checklist for that key.\n\nFor the others, append_checklist.\n\nBut the system says to use append_checklist for adding new entries, and update_checklist for replacing entire lists or setting Not Applicable.\n\nSo for Significant_Terms, since it's empty, append the two entries.\n\nDate_of_Settlement: append the one entry.\n\nHow_Long: append.\n\nWhether: append \"Yes\".\n\nDisputes: update to \"Not Applicable\".\n\nWait, but the checklist summary shows all keys are empty, so the first entries would be appended.\n\nBut the system says \"append_checklist\" adds new entries, so for each key, append the new values.\n\nFor Disputes, since it's empty, but we need to mark it as Not Applicable, we have to use update_checklist to replace the empty list with the Not Applicable entry.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist for the first four keys and update_checklist for Disputes.\n\nBut the assistant can batch multiple keys in one call. So the tool call would be a single append_checklist for the four keys with their values, and a separate update_checklist for Disputes.\n\nWait, but the tools allow batching in one call. So the patch can include multiple keys.\n\nSo for append_checklist, the patch would have four keys with their extracted entries.\n\nFor update_checklist, the patch would have Disputes with the Not Applicable entry.\n\nBut the assistant can only do one action per turn. So it has to choose one. Since the user's instructions say \"exactly ONE action per turn\", the next action should be either append_checklist or update_checklist for one or more keys.\n\nBut the user's example shows that after reading, you append the values. So since the document has been read, the next step is to append the found values.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call append_checklist with the four keys that have values, and then in a separate action (but this turn only one), but since it's one action per turn, the assistant should make one tool call that batches all the append entries.\n\nWait, the append_checklist allows batching multiple keys in one call. So the patch can have multiple keys.\n\nSimilarly, the update_checklist for Disputes can be in the same tool call? No, because append and update are different functions. So the assistant has to choose either to append the four keys, or update the Disputes key. But since the Disputes key needs to be set to Not Applicable via update_checklist, and the others via append, the assistant should first append the four keys, then in the next turn update the Disputes.\n\nBut the problem is that the current turn is the first one after reading the document, so the assistant should append the values found.\n\nWait, the recent actions include step 2: read_document on Stipulation for Dismissal. Now, the assistant needs to process the text read and decide the next action. The text contains the values for Date, Significant Terms, How Long, Whether. Disputes is Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next action is to append the values for the first four keys, and update Disputes.\n\nBut since it's one action per turn, the assistant must choose to either append the four or update Disputes. But the system says \"After each read_document... your next action MUST be append_checklist or update_checklist if you found extractable values.\"\n\nSo the assistant should use append_checklist for the keys that have values, and update_checklist for Disputes.\n\nBut since it's one action, the assistant can make a single append_checklist call for the four keys, and then a separate update_checklist for Disputes in the next turn. However, the instructions say \"exactly one action per turn\", so this turn, the assistant should do the append for the four keys.\n\nWait, but the Disputes key's Not Applicable must be set via update_checklist, which is a separate action. So this turn, the assistant should call append_checklist with the four keys, and then next turn call update_checklist for Disputes.\n\nBut the assistant can't do both in one turn. So the first action after reading is to append the found values (the four keys), then in the next turn, handle Disputes.\n\nSo the correct tool call now is append_checklist with the four keys.\n\nLet's structure the append_checklist patch.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Settlement:\n\n- Entry 1: value \"dismissal with prejudice\", evidence from the text: \"dismissal of this action with prejudice\", source_document \"Stipulation for Dismissal\", location \"Page 1, paragraph 1\".\n\n- Entry 2: value \"no attorneys’ fees or costs\", evidence: \"without attorneys’ fees or costs to either party\", same source and location.\n\nDate_of_Settlement: value \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\", evidence: \"Dated: December 20, 2024\", source \"Stipulation for Dismissal\", location \"Page 1, Dated line\".\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: value \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\", evidence: \"dismissal with prejudice\" (since dismissal with prejudice is permanent), source same, location same.\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: value \"Yes\", evidence: the stipulation is filed with the court under Rule 41, which requires court approval, so it's court-enforced. So the evidence would be the reference to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which is a court rule for dismissal with court approval.\n\nWait, the document says \"Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), ...\", which is the rule for voluntary dismissal with court approval. So the settlement (dismissal) is court-enforced because it's part of the court's order. So the evidence is the citation to the rule.\n\nSo the value is \"Yes\", evidence: \"Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\".\n\nNow, Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: needs to be set to Not Applicable. So in the next action, but not this one.\n\nSo for this turn, the assistant should call append_checklist with the four keys.\n\nWait, but the checklist items are 5, and Disputes is empty. The Disputes item has no values, so it's empty, but the assistant needs to mark it as Not Applicable. However, according to the instructions, \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\"\n\nThe document is a stipulation for dismissal without any mention of disputes. So the absence of disputes is evidence that there are no disputes over enforcement. So the evidence for Not Applicable is the stipulation's language indicating mutual agreement without disputes.\n\nTherefore, Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement should be set to Not Applicable via update_checklist.\n\nBut the current turn, after reading the document, the assistant should first append the found values (the other four keys), and then in the next turn, update the Disputes key.\n\nSo the current action is to append the four keys.\n\nSo the tool call is append_checklist with the four keys and their extracted entries.\n\nNow, check the parameters for append_checklist.\n\nThe patch is an array of items, each with key and extracted (array of entries).\n\nEach extracted entry has value and evidence (array of evidence entries, each with text, source, location).\n\nSo for Significant_Terms, two entries.\n\nLet's structure the JSON.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Settlement:\n\nextracted: [\n  {\n    value: \"dismissal with prejudice\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"dismissal of this action with prejudice\",\n        source_document: \"Stipulation for Dismissal\",\n        location: \"Page 1, paragraph 1\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    value: \"no attorneys’ fees or costs\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"without attorneys’ fees or costs to either party\",\n        source_document: \"Stipulation for Dismissal\",\n        location: \"Page 1, paragraph 1\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nDate_of_Settlement:\n\nextracted: [\n  {\n    value: \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"Dated: December 20, 2024\",\n        source_document: \"Stipulation for Dismissal\",\n        location: \"Page 1, Dated line\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last:\n\nextracted: [\n  {\n    value: \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"dismissal with prejudice\",\n        source_document: \"Stipulation for Dismissal\",\n        location: \"Page 1, paragraph 1\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not:\n\nextracted: [\n  {\n    value: \"Yes\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"Pursuant to Fed.

The task is to extract all checklist items from the legal documents. The user has already done Steps 1-3, and now we're at Step 4. The current status shows that 4 out of 5 checklist items have been filled, and the remaining one is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" which is empty.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read that again. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Docket, Order, Notice from U.S. House, Motion to Intervene, and Plaintiffs' Response. \n\nThe missing item is about disputes over settlement enforcement. The existing documents include a \"Notice From the U.S. House of Representatives That Its Intervention Motion is Not Moot After Stipulated Dismissal\" and related motions. These might contain information about disputes or motions related to the settlement. \n\nSince the missing key is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", I should check if any of the unvisited documents mention disputes, motions, or proceedings about enforcing the settlement. The Notice from the U.S. House might be relevant because it's about intervention after dismissal, which could relate to disputes. \n\nThe next logical step is to search for any mention of disputes, enforcement, or motions related to the settlement. Using `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"dispute|enforcement|motion|proceeding\" across the relevant documents. But to be efficient, maybe target the Notice and Motion documents first since they're about intervention and motions, which might discuss disputes.\n\nWait, the document names: \"Notice From the U.S. House...\" and \"Motion of the U.S. House...\" are likely to contain such information. So, using `search_document_regex` on those specific documents with a pattern that looks for dispute-related terms. The pattern could be something like \"dispute|enforcement|motion.*settlement|settlement.*enforcement\" to find relevant sections.\n\nBut the instructions say to use precise patterns. Let's consider that \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" would be mentioned in the context of motions or notices. So, the regex pattern should look for terms like \"dispute\", \"enforcement\", \"motion\", \"proceeding\" in the context of the settlement.\n\nThe user should call `search_document_regex` with `doc_names` set to the relevant documents (Notice and Motion) and a pattern that targets those terms. Since the pattern needs to be anchored to document structure, maybe \"dispute|enforcement\" as the pattern. The flags can be IGNORECASE to catch variations.\n\nWait, the parameters for `search_document_regex` allow specifying `doc_names` as an array. So, I'll set `doc_names` to [\"Notice From the U.S. House of Representatives That Its Intervention Motion is Not Moot After Stipulated Dismissal\", \"Motion of the U.S. House of Representatives to Intervene with Incorporated memorandum of Law\"] and pattern \"dispute|enforcement|motion|proceeding\". But to be precise, maybe focus on \"dispute\" and \"enforcement\" since the key is about disputes over enforcement.\n\nSo, the next action should be `search_document_regex` on those two documents with the pattern \"dispute|enforcement\". That way, it'll search those specific documents for those terms and return matches with context. Then, after getting the matches, the next step would be to read the relevant parts or append the findings.\n\nWait, the current state says the empty key is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\". The existing documents that might contain this info are the Notice and Motion. So searching those two with the regex pattern makes sense. The other documents (Complaint, Docket, Order) might not be as relevant, but the Notice and Motion are directly related to intervention after dismissal, which could involve disputes over enforcement.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use `search_document_regex` on the two specific documents with the pattern. That's more efficient than reading the entire documents.

The task is to extract all 5 checklist items, but one is still empty: Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted 4 out of 5 items. The empty key is Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement. The recent actions show they did a search_document_regex for terms like \"dispute\", \"enforcement\", etc., and found matches in two documents: the Notice from the U.S. House and the Motion to Intervene. \n\nIn the search results, there are matches in both documents that mention disputes, motions, and proceedings related to the settlement. For example, in the Notice document, it says \"the stipulated dismissal (ECF No. 65) does not moot the pending motion to intervene (ECF No. 60)\" and talks about the court having to decide the motion. The Motion document mentions the House moving to intervene and appealing the court's decision.\n\nSo, the key here is Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement. The search results have evidence that there are disputes about the settlement enforcement, specifically the motion to intervene. The House is contesting that the dismissal doesn't moot their motion, implying a dispute over enforcement.\n\nThe next step should be to use the evidence from the search results to append the Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement item. The search found matches in two documents, so I need to check if there's enough evidence to create an entry. The matches mention \"motion to intervene\" and \"dispute\" related to the settlement dismissal, which fits the checklist definition.\n\nSince the search was done and the matches are found, the next action should be to append the checklist entry for Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement using the evidence from those matches. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nWait, the user has already done the search, so the next logical step is to append the checklist with the found values. The search results show that there are disputes (the motion to intervene), so the value would be something like \"Motion to intervene by U.S. House of Representatives regarding enforcement of settlement.\" The evidence would be from the Notice document's matches.\n\nI need to make sure that the extracted value is properly formatted. The checklist item's definition says to include information about disagreements, motions, or proceedings. The matches mention the motion to intervene, which is a proceeding related to enforcement, so it fits.\n\nSo, the action is to call append_checklist for the Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement key, adding the evidence from the search results. The search had matches in two documents, but the Notice document's matches (like Match 1 and 2) are the most relevant. For example, the text says \"the stipulated dismissal (ECF No. 65) does not moot the pending motion to intervene (ECF No. 60)\" which directly relates to disputes over settlement enforcement.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to append the checklist with that evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"U.S. House of Representatives' motion to intervene (ECF No. 60) regarding enforceability of stipulated dismissal\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the stipulated dismissal (ECF No. 65) does not moot the pending motion to intervene (ECF No. 60).

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items from the legal case documents. The current status shows that all 5 checklist items have values already extracted. Let me double-check each one.\n\nFirst, Significant_Terms_of_Settlement has two values: \"dismissal with prejudice\" and \"no attorneys’ fees or costs\". Both are from the Stipulation for Dismissal. The Date_of_Settlement has \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\" from the same document. How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\", also from the Stipulation. Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not is \"Yes\" based on the Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 reference. Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement has the House's motion to intervene as a dispute.\n\nThe user's recent actions show that Step 5 successfully appended Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement. The current status says all keys have values, no empty or Not Applicable. The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Docket, etc., but the checklist items seem fully covered. \n\nWait, the checklist definitions mention that for Date_of_Settlement, the value should be formatted as '[date]: [settlement]'. The extracted value is \"December 20, 2024: dismissal with prejudice\", which matches. Similarly, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is \"permanent: dismissal with prejudice\", which fits the format.\n\nI need to make sure there's no missing information. The Disputes item has a value from the Notice document, which was partially read. The other documents haven't been checked, but the checklist items don't require more data. For example, the settlement terms are covered in the Stipulation, and the dispute is covered in the Notice. The other documents (Complaint, Docket, etc.) might not have additional settlement details, as the Stipulation is the settlement document itself.\n\nThe user's instructions say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, all keys are filled. The system says to verify with get_checklist before stopping. But the current status says \"Keys with Values: 5/5\", so maybe it's already confirmed. However, the policy says to use get_checklist periodically to assess gaps. But since the user's step 5 already appended the last item, and the status shows all filled, maybe it's time to stop.\n\nWait, the recent action history shows Step 5 was append_checklist for Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement, which was the last key. Now the status says all keys have values. So the next step should be to stop. The tools don't require another get_checklist if the status is already clear. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are complete. So the correct action here is to return the stop decision.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 5 checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items from the legal case documents. They've provided a snapshot of the current status after several steps.\n\nFirst, I need to check the checklist items. There are five: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, Date_of_Settlement, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not, and Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 5 added Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement. Step 6 tried to stop, but the system ran get_checklist automatically. The checklist status shows all 5 keys are filled: 5/5 filled, 0 empty. The filled keys have their respective values, all with evidence from the documents they've read.\n\nThe documents that are partially visited are the Notice and Motion from the House, but they've already been searched for relevant terms. The Stipulation for Dismissal is fully visited. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist items seem to be covered by the existing evidence.\n\nWait, the user mentioned in Step 3 that they appended four keys from the Stipulation, and Step 5 added the fifth from the Notice. The get_checklist after Step 6 shows all keys are filled. The system says \"All 5 checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence. No remaining gaps or Not Applicable items.\"\n\nThe current status shows 5/5 filled, 0 empty. So all items have values. The next step should be to stop. The user's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Since all are filled and verified, the correct action is to stop.\n\nI need to make sure there's no missing data. The Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement has one entry from the Notice document, which was covered in the search. The other items are from the Stipulation, which is fully read. No other documents are needed because the checklist items are all covered. The unvisited documents (Complaint, Docket, etc.) don't seem relevant for these specific checklist items based on the evidence provided.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop.
