The user needs to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The checklist requires that each appeal is formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I should check which documents might contain this information. The available documents are a Complaint, Docket, Order on Cross-Motions, Notice from the U.S. House, Motions, Responses, and a Stipulation for Dismissal.\n\nThe Docket is usually where case proceedings are listed, including appeals. The Order on Cross-Motions might mention appeals if the court addressed them. The Stipulation for Dismissal might have a note about appeals being dismissed, but the user mentioned \"appeals taken,\" so maybe not. The Notice from the U.S. House and Motions might not directly relate to appeals unless specified.\n\nSince the Docket is the most likely place for an appeal to be listed, I should start there. The Docket document is 7,588 tokens, which is under 10,000, so reading the whole thing is possible. But maybe I should use `read_document` on the Docket to check for any mention of appeals.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value,\" so I need to make sure I get all instances. The Docket might list the appeal details under a specific section. Let's go with `read_document` on the Docket document, starting from token 0 to the end (since it's unvisited). The maximum token range is 10,000, and the Docket is 7,588, so that's safe.\n\nI should call `read_document` for the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 7588. That should give me the full text to search for \"appeal\" or similar terms. Then, after reading, I can look for the relevant evidence and append it to the checklist.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7588}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7588}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3379, "completion_tokens": 446, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is the \"Appeal\" item. The checklist definition says to extract information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key is empty, and there are 7 documents in the corpus. The Docket document has been fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and the other 6 documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The recent action was reading the Docket (tokens 0-7588), but the Docket text provided doesn't mention any appeals. Let me check the Docket entries again.\n\nThe Docket entries go up to entry 70, which is a withdrawal of the intervention motion by the U.S. House of Representatives. There's no mention of an appeal to a higher court. All the entries are about motions, orders, complaints, and dismissals, but nothing about an appeal process. For example, entries like \"ORDER granting 36 Motion for Summary Judgment\" or \"STIPULATION of Dismissal\" don't indicate an appeal. The case seems to be proceeding through the district court, with no references to an appellate court.\n\nSince the Docket has been fully read and no appeals are mentioned there, the next step is to check the other documents. The available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\", and others. However, the checklist item is specifically about appeals, so I need to look for any mention of appeals in these documents.\n\nBut wait, the user's requirement says to extract EVERY distinct value of the checklist item found in any document. If none of the documents mention an appeal, then the \"Appeal\" key should be marked as Not Applicable. But before setting it to Not Applicable, I need to confirm that no appeals are present in any document. The Docket was fully read, but the other documents are unvisited. So, I should check if any of the other documents might contain information about an appeal.\n\nHowever, the current step is to decide the next action. The Docket is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but since the checklist is about \"Appeal\", maybe I should search for patterns like \"appeal\", \"appellate court\", \"Court of Appeals\", etc. Using `search_document_regex` could efficiently find any mentions of appeals across all unvisited documents.\n\nThe regex pattern could be something like r'Appeal|appellate court|Court of Appeals|appeals', but the problem is that the exact wording might vary. However, the checklist definition says the extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].', so the documents might use terms like \"appealed to the Court of Appeals\" or similar.\n\nGiven that the Docket didn't have any appeals, and the other documents are unvisited, using `search_document_regex` on all unvisited documents with a pattern like \"appeal\" or \"appellate\" would be efficient. This way, I can find any relevant sections without having to read each document entirely.\n\nSo the next action should be `search_document_regex` with a pattern that matches potential appeal references. The parameters would be doc_name='all' (since all unvisited documents need to be checked), pattern='appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals', and context_tokens set to 200 to get surrounding text.\n\nWait, the available documents are 6 unvisited ones: Complaint, Order/Opinion, Other, Motion, Plaintiffs' Response, Stipulation. But the regex search should cover all of them. The tool allows doc_name='all' to search all documents. So using `search_document_regex` with doc_name='all' and a suitable pattern.\n\nThe pattern needs to be precise. Let's use r'\\bAppeal\\b|\\bappellate\\b|\\bCourt of Appeals\\b' to match those terms. The flags can be IGNORECASE to catch variations in case.\n\nSo the function call would be search_document_regex with pattern 'Appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals', doc_name='all', and context_tokens=200. This should find any mentions of appeals in the unvisited documents.\n\nAfter getting the search results, if there are matches, I can read those specific sections. If no matches are found, then I can set the Appeal key to Not Applicable via update_checklist.\n\nBut the immediate next step is to perform the search, so the correct action is to call search_document_regex.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"all\", \"pattern\": \"Appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals\", \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals", "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11193, "completion_tokens": 1031, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract \"Appeal\" information from legal documents based on a specific checklist item. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key is empty. The recent actions show they've already read the Docket (fully visited), and did a regex search for \"Appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals\" across all documents, finding two matches in two different pleadings. The regex search returned snippets from two documents, both mentioning appellate courts.\n\nThe key here is to check if those snippets actually contain the required \"Appeal\" information. Let's examine the matches:\n\n1. From \"Motion of the U.S. House of Representatives to Intervene\":\n   - Mentions \"seeking appellate review\" and \"Courts have routinely granted motions to intervene...\"\n   - But doesn't specify who appealed or to which court. It's about intervention, not an appeal that's already taken.\n\n2. From \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response...\":\n   - Cites \"CVLR Performance Horses, Inc. v. Wynne, 792 F.3d 469 (4th Cir. 2015)\" which is a case name and court (4th Circuit).\n   - The text mentions \"they appealed; shortly thereafter, the parties agreed to dismiss the district court action and moved to also dismiss the would-be intervenors' appeal.\"\n   - This indicates an appeal was taken to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAh, this is the relevant one. The plaintiffs (Jane Doe and Susan Roe) are referencing an appeal that was dismissed. The court is the 4th Circuit. So the extracted value should be \"Appeal: Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\"\n\nNow, I need to confirm if this is the only relevant entry. The regex search found two matches, but only the second one actually describes an appeal taken. The first match is about seeking appellate review (future action), not an appeal that's already happened.\n\nThe document \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response...\" has been partially visited (tokens 1294-1494), but the relevant text is in that range. I should read more of this document to ensure there's no other appeal information, but the current snippet seems sufficient for one entry.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited, but since the regex search already found the relevant text, and the Docket is fully visited (with no appeal mentions), I should proceed to extract this value.\n\nFor evidence, I'll need:\n- Verbatim text: the part about \"CVLR Performance Horses, Inc. v. Wynne, 792 F.3d 469 (4th Cir. 2015)\" and the appeal reference.\n- Source document: \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response and Objection to Notice Filed by the U.S. House of Representatives\"\n- Location: tokens 1294-1494 (as per the search)\n\nWait, the search result shows tokens 1294-1494, but the actual relevant text is in that range. I should use that as the location.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But the format requires \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So the value should be \"Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\"\n\nI need to make sure it's correctly formatted. The example given in the checklist is \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So the value is \"Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\"\n\nNow, since this is the first value found, I should use `append_checklist` to add this entry. I'll structure the evidence with the text snippet, document name, and location.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context.\" The text snippet from the document includes \"the would-be intervenors' appeal\" and the citation, so that's sufficient evidence.\n\nAlso, need to check if there are other appeals. The regex search only found these two matches, and only the second one has an actual appeal reference. The Docket is fully read and doesn't mention appeals. So this is likely the only entry.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this checklist entry using `append_checklist`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"CVLR Performance Horses, Inc. v.

The user is asking to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting information about any appeals taken, including the appealing parties and appellate court, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already done a search for \"Appeal|appellate|Court of Appeals\" and found two matches. Then they appended one value from the Plaintiffs' response document. The extracted value is based on a citation to a Fourth Circuit case (CVLR Performance Horses, Inc. v. Wynne, 792 F.3d 469 (4th Cir. 2015)), which mentions the Fourth Circuit.\n\nBut wait, the extracted value they added says \"Jane Doe, Susan Roe appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" However, the actual document snippet they referenced doesn't explicitly state that Jane Doe and Susan Roe are appealing. The case citation is used as an example of a prior case where intervenors appealed. So the extracted value might be incorrect because it's not directly stating that Jane Doe and Susan Roe are appealing; it's just referencing another case.\n\nThe user needs to verify if there's an actual appeal by Jane Doe and Susan Roe. The document they read (Plaintiffs' Response) is talking about a case where the intervenors (the House of Representatives) were seeking to appeal, but the actual plaintiffs (Jane Doe and Susan Roe) might not be appealing. The snippet mentions \"the individuals seeking to intervene sought to do so as plaintiffs\" and then refers to their appeal, but it's about the intervenors, not the plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about appeals taken by the parties in the case. The case in the document is the current case (Doe v. Austin), and the citation to CVLR Performance Horses is an example. The actual appeal in the current case isn't mentioned. The current case is still in the district court; the Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF 58) was issued in November 2024, and the case was dismissed via stipulation (ECF 65) in December 2024. There's no mention of an appeal being taken yet. The House of Representatives' motion to intervene (ECF 60) was withdrawn (ECF 70), so no appeal there either.\n\nThe user's extracted value might be incorrect because they misinterpreted the citation as referring to the current case's appeal. The Fourth Circuit case is a separate case, not the current one. So the extracted value isn't valid evidence for the current case's appeal.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, the \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\" (17,747 tokens) is unvisited. That's a key document where the court might have addressed appeals or mentioned if an appeal was taken. The current case was dismissed, but maybe the order mentions that no appeal was filed, or perhaps there's an appeal pending.\n\nAlso, the \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" (787 tokens) is unvisited. A stipulated dismissal might be without prejudice, which could allow for an appeal, but the document itself might state whether an appeal was taken.\n\nThe user has only extracted one value, but it's likely incorrect. They need to check other documents to see if there's an actual appeal mentioned.\n\nThe next step should be to read the \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\" document (ECF 58) because that's a major order in the case. It's 17k tokens, but they can read a portion. Since it's unvisited, they need to read it to check for any mention of appeals.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is unvisited, but it's the initial complaint, so it's unlikely to mention an appeal. The appeal would come after a final judgment, which hasn't happened yet since the case was dismissed. The dismissal was on Dec 20, 2024 (ECF 65), so any appeal would be after that, but the current documents go up to Jan 2025 (ECF 70). The \"Order on Cross-Motions\" was Nov 2024, so the appeal might be mentioned in later documents.\n\nWait, the current documents include ECF 65 (stipulated dismissal) and ECF 70 (withdrawal of intervention), but no appeal filings. So maybe there's no appeal, and the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's previous extraction was incorrect. They need to verify if there's any actual appeal in the documents. The correct approach is to check all relevant documents for explicit mentions of an appeal.\n\nThe \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\" (ECF 58) is the most likely place where the court would state that the case is final and whether an appeal was taken. Let's check the description: \"ORDER ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT granting in part and denying in part 36 Motion for Summary Judgment; granting in part and denying in part 46 Cross Motion for Summary Judgment.\" This is a final order, so if it's a final judgment, an appeal could be filed. But the order itself might not mention an appeal; it's possible that the case was dismissed later via stipulation (ECF 65), which might have been without prejudice, so no appeal was taken.\n\nWait, ECF 65 is a \"STIPULATION of Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\", which is a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. So the case is dismissed, but the parties could refile, and since it's without prejudice, there's no appeal. But the user's checklist is about appeals taken, so if the case was dismissed without prejudice, there's no appeal, so it should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. The key is whether any appeal was filed. The documents show the case was dismissed, and the House's intervention motion was withdrawn, but no appeal is mentioned. The only mention of an appellate court is in the case citation in the Plaintiffs' response, which is an example, not the current case.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is incorrect. The correct action is to either correct the extracted value or mark it as Not Applicable. But since the user already appended the incorrect value, they need to update it.\n\nWait, the user's step 4 was append_checklist with the value they extracted. But the evidence they provided doesn't support that Jane Doe and Susan Roe appealed. So they need to use update_checklist to replace the incorrect entry with either the correct value (if found) or set it to Not Applicable.\n\nBut first, they should check if there's any actual mention of an appeal in the documents. The \"Order on Cross-Motions\" (ECF 58) is unvisited. Let's see what's in that document. If it's a final judgment, the order might state that the case is final and appealable, but the documents don't mention an appeal being filed. The dismissal (ECF 65) is a stipulation, so no appeal was taken.\n\nThe checklist item requires extracting \"any appeals taken.\" If no appeal was taken, then the item should be set to Not Applicable. The evidence would be the stipulated dismissal without prejudice (ECF 65) stating that the case is dismissed, and no appeal was filed.\n\nBut to confirm, the user should check the \"Order on Cross-Motions\" (ECF 58) to see if it's a final judgment. If it is, and the parties didn't appeal, then the appeal item is Not Applicable.\n\nAlternatively, they could read the \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" (ECF 65) to see if it mentions appeal rights. The stipulation says \"pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\", which is a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, so no appeal is possible from that dismissal. Therefore, there's no appeal, so the item should be Not Applicable.\n\nThe user's current extracted value is wrong, so they need to update the checklist. But to do that, they need to confirm there's no appeal. The correct step is to use update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" for the Appeal key, citing the stipulated dismissal as evidence.\n\nHowever, the current status shows they have one value extracted, but it's incorrect. The next action should be to get the checklist to see what's there, then update it.\n\nWait, the current state shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" with the incorrect value. To correct it, they need to either append the correct value (if found) or update to Not Applicable.\n\nBut they haven't checked all documents. The \"Order on Cross-Motions\" is unvisited, but it's likely that the order is the final judgment, and since the case was dismissed via stipulation, there's no appeal. So the evidence for Not Applicable would be the stipulated dismissal without prejudice.\n\nThe correct action now is to call get_checklist to see the current state of the Appeal key, then decide whether to update it to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that after each append or update, they should verify if all values were included. Since the extracted value was incorrect, they need to correct it. But to do that, they should first check the documents for any actual appeal mention.\n\nBut the documents don't mention an appeal. The only reference to an appellate court is a case citation in the Plaintiffs' response, which isn't relevant to the current case's appeal.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist to set Appeal to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the stipulated dismissal.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm the evidence. The stipulation (ECF 65) states it's a dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which means no appeal can be taken from that dismissal. So the evidence is the stipulation itself.\n\nSo the next step is to update the checklist for Appeal to Not Applicable.\n\nBut before that, they should check if there's any other document that might mention an appeal. The \"Order on Cross-Motions\" (ECF 58) is a final order, but the case was later dismissed, so ECF 58 might not be the final judgment. The dismissal (ECF 65) is the final action, so the appeal would have to be from the dismissal, but since it's without prejudice, no appeal.\n\nThus, the correct action is to update the checklist for Appeal to Not Applicable.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"STIPULATION of Dismissal pursuant to Fed.

Wynne) but that was a citation to another case, not an actual appeal in this case. Then they updated the checklist to Not Applicable based on the stipulation of dismissal.\n\nThe problem here is that the stipulation of dismissal (ECF 65) says they're dismissing the case, which would mean there's no appeal because the case is over. So the Not Applicable makes sense because the case was dismissed, so there's no appeal to report.\n\nNow, checking the documents.

But the evidence for Not Applicable was taken from it. So maybe they read it but didn't mark it as fully visited. Wait, the evidence says \"Evidence 1 from Stipulation for Dismissal (ECF 65)\", but the document is marked as ○ Unvisited. So maybe they haven't read it fully yet, but they referenced it for the Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the Stipulation for Dismissal is listed as unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the evidence for Not Applicable was taken from it.

But the previous step (Step 5) used the Stipulation for Dismissal as evidence for Not Applicable. So that's a problem because if the document is unvisited, they shouldn't have evidence from it.\n\nWait, looking at the Recent Actions (Steps 1-5), Step 5 was update_checklist using evidence from Stipulation for Dismissal (ECF 65). But the document is listed as unvisited. So maybe they didn't actually read it, but assumed it's the dismissal. But according to the process, you need to have evidence from a document. So if they haven't read the document, they can't cite it as evidence.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from Stipulation for Dismissal. But the document is unvisited. So the correct action here would be to read the Stipulation for Dismissal document to confirm the evidence, because they can't use a document they haven't read as evidence.\n\nWait, but the Stipulation for Dismissal is listed as unvisited (○ Unvisited), so they need to read it. However, the document is only 787 tokens, so reading the whole thing is feasible.\n\nWait, but in Step 5, they did an update_checklist setting Appeal to Not Applicable with evidence from that document. But since the document wasn't read, that's a mistake. The system requires evidence from a document that's been read. So the current state might have an invalid entry because the evidence source wasn't properly read.\n\nTherefore, the correct next step is to read the Stipulation for Dismissal document (which is 787 tokens, so reading the whole thing is fine) to confirm that it's a dismissal and that there's no appeal. Then, after reading it, they can confirm the Not Applicable status.\n\nWait, but the user's current status says \"Not Applicable\" is already set with evidence from that document, but the document is unvisited. So the evidence is invalid. Therefore, the correct action is to read the Stipulation document to get the actual text and verify.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" for tokens 0-787 (since it's 787 tokens total). Then, after reading, check if the text confirms that the case was dismissed without an appeal, which would support the Not Applicable entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Stipulation document's content is obvious (it's a stipulation of dismissal), so reading it would confirm. But according to the process, you must have evidence from a read document.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call read_document on \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" with start_token 0 and end_token 787 (since it's the whole document).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Stipulation for Dismissal\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 787}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Stipulation for Dismissal", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 787}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12073, "completion_tokens": 1177, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is the \"Appeal\" item. The task is to find any appeals taken, including the parties and appellate court, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status: the checklist key \"Appeal\" is marked as Not Applicable with evidence from the Stipulation for Dismissal (ECF 65). The evidence cited was the stipulation dismissing the case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which means the case was dismissed without a judgment, so there's no appeal. \n\nWait, but earlier in Step 4, they appended an entry based on a reference to a Fourth Circuit case in the Plaintiffs' Response. Then in Step 5, they updated it to Not Applicable using the Stipulation for Dismissal. The Stipulation says \"dismissal with prejudice\" under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which typically means the case is over and no appeal would be possible since there's no judgment. So the Not Applicable is correct.\n\nNow, checking the documents. The Docket is fully visited, and the Stipulation for Dismissal is also fully read. The other documents like the Motion to Intervene and the Plaintiffs' Response had partial views, but the evidence for the appeal was already used and then corrected to Not Applicable. The current status shows Appeal is marked as Not Applicable with proper evidence.\n\nThe available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Order on Cross-Motions, and Notice from U.S. House. But the Checklist item \"Appeal\" is already set to Not Applicable. The requirement is to stop when all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's already Not Applicable with valid evidence, there's no need to read more documents.\n\nWait, but the user's step 6 was reading the Stipulation for Dismissal, which confirmed the dismissal. The evidence from the Stipulation (ECF 65) is sufficient for Not Applicable. The earlier entry from the Plaintiffs' Response was a misinterpretation because the case reference was a citation, not an actual appeal in this case. So the update to Not Applicable was correct.\n\nTherefore, all checklist items are now correctly marked. The next step should be to stop. The current status shows 1 key, all handled. So the correct action is to stop with the reason that Appeal is properly marked as Not Applicable.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are accounted for: Appeal is marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence from Stipulation for Dismissal (ECF 65), confirming no appeal was taken due to dismissal under Fed.

The user is asking to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents.

The system shows it's marked as Not Applicable with evidence from the Stipulation for Dismissal. The evidence given is from the Stipulation document, which states the case was dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), and the parties are Jane Doe and Susan Roe.\n\nWait, in Step 5, they updated the checklist to set Appeal as Not Applicable because the Stipulation says it's dismissed. Then in Step 6, they read the Stipulation document fully. Step 7 was a stop, but then the system did a get_checklist and now it's asking for another action.\n\nThe current status says all keys are filled (1/1), with Appeal marked as Not Applicable. The documents listed as fully visited include Stipulation for Dismissal, which was read in Step 6. The other documents are either partially visited or unvisited, but the checklist item is already set to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that Not Applicable must be confirmed with explicit evidence. The Stipulation document shows dismissal without appeal, so that's valid. The prior steps already set it to Not Applicable with the evidence from the Stipulation. The recent action (Step 7) was a stop, but the system's automatic review says to check again.\n\nNow, the available documents: the Stipulation is fully visited, and the checklist key is already marked Not Applicable. The other documents might have mentions of appeals, but the system's current state shows Appeal is already handled as Not Applicable. However, the user's checklist requires extracting all distinct values. But since it's marked Not Applicable, that means no appeal exists, so no need to look further.\n\nWait, but the system's checklist status shows 1/1 filled, which includes the Not Applicable entry. The \"Not Applicable\" is a valid entry as per the policy. The evidence is there from the Stipulation. So there's no need to do anything else. The user should stop.\n\nThe previous stop (Step 7) was called, but the system is prompting for a second stop. The instructions say to call stop again if satisfied. Since all keys are accounted for (Appeal is Not Applicable with evidence), the correct action is to stop again.\n\nThe current state says \"Keys Marked as Not Applicable: 1\" and the checklist status is 1/1 filled.
