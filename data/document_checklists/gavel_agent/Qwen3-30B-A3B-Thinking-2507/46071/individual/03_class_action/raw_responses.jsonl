The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows 0 out of 1 key has values, and it's empty. So I need to find where this information is. The available documents are all unvisited, so I should start by reading one of them. The complaint is a good starting point because class action status is often in the complaint.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the first one. Since it's unvisited, I should read it. The token count is 6,174, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. But the instructions say not to reread fully visited docs, but this is unvisited, so it's okay.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"targeted window\" but since it's unvisited, reading the whole document is acceptable. But maybe I should check if there's a specific section. However, without knowing the content, it's safer to read the entire document. The complaint usually states whether it's a class action.\n\nSo the next step is to call read_document on the Complaint. The start_token is 0, end_token is 6174. That should cover the whole document. Then, after reading, I can look for the class action status in the text.\n\nI need to make sure I don't miss it. If the complaint mentions \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\", that's the info. Once I get the text, I'll process it to find the value and evidence.\n\nNo regex needed here because the document is small and the info is likely in the complaint's body. So the first action should be read_document for the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 6174}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 6174}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3409, "completion_tokens": 436, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to format it as either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the Complaint document (tokens 0-6174). Now, I need to check if the Complaint contains the necessary information. Let's scan through the text they provided.\n\nIn the Complaint, the first page lists the plaintiffs as \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs\". The case is titled \"COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and it's a civil action. The plaintiffs are Jane Doe and John Doe. The complaint mentions they're suing as plaintiffs, but there's no explicit mention of whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The key part is in the \"PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\" where it says \"Plaintiffs assert claims...\" but it doesn't specify if it's a class action. \n\nWait, the document is a complaint, and typically, if it's a class action, it would state that. But here, the plaintiffs are named as individuals: Jane Doe and John Doe. The case is filed by them as individuals. The complaint doesn't mention a class. So, it's likely individual plaintiffs. The description would need to say \"Individual, described as [Jane Doe and John Doe]\".\n\nBut I need to check if there's any other document that might clarify. However, the current status shows that only the Complaint has been read (fully visited), and the other documents are unvisited. But the question is about extracting from all documents. However, the checklist item is for the status, which should be in the complaint or a related document. Since the complaint is the first document, and it's a standard complaint with individual plaintiffs, the answer here is probably \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nWait, the requirement says to create separate entries for each unique value. So, since the complaint names two individuals, the value would be \"Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\". The format needs to be exactly as specified.\n\nNow, checking the evidence. The text from the complaint says \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\" on the first page. So the evidence is that line. The source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is the first page, tokens 0-6174, but since it's fully visited, the location can be page 1.\n\nSo, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\". Wait, the required format is 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So the [description] part would be \"Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nWait, the example says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So the value should be \"Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\", but the key's value is the entire string. Wait, the instruction says: \"the extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, the extracted value itself should be the string \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So for this case, it's \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nBut let's confirm. The plaintiffs are Jane Doe and John Doe, so they are individual plaintiffs. The description is \"Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nNow, evidence: the text snippet from the complaint where they are listed as plaintiffs. The first page says \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\". So the evidence text is \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\" from the document.\n\nLocation: Page 1, since it's the first page of the document.\n\nSource document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSo, now, since this is the first time we're extracting this value, we should use append_checklist to add this entry. Wait, but the checklist item is empty, so appending is the right action.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value needs to be appended. Since it's the first value, we need to add it. But the instructions say that append_checklist adds new entries. Since it's the first entry, we should append it.\n\nSo, the action should be append_checklist with the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" and the extracted value as the formatted string, with evidence.\n\nWait, the evidence must include the text, source, and location. So the evidence entry would have:\n\n- text: \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\"\n- source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- location: \"Page 1\"\n\nAnd the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\".\n\nWait, but the value is the formatted string, and the evidence supports it. So the extracted value is that string, and the evidence is the text snippet.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch would have key: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", extracted: [ { value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\", evidence: [ { text: \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\", source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"Page 1\" } ] } ]\n\nBut the problem is, the document's text shows \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\" on page 1. So that's the evidence.\n\nNow, the next step is to append this value. Since the checklist key is empty, and we have a value, we need to append it. We shouldn't use update_checklist here because it's the first entry. So append_checklist is the right action.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited, but the complaint already contains the information. So no need to read other documents for this key. The key is now filled with one value.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call append_checklist with the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe", "evidence": [{"text": "JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9994, "completion_tokens": 1464, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they need to specify if it's a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, found 7 documents. Step 2 read the Complaint document (tokens 0-6174), and Step 3 appended the value from that document. The extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Jane Doe and John Doe\" based on the complaint's opening line.\n\nNow, the current status shows that the Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Docket, Order, Notice, Motion, Response, and Stipulation. The task is to check if any of these other documents mention a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value. The current extracted value is for individual plaintiffs. But maybe another document refers to a class action. For example, the Motion to Intervene or the Stipulation might have info on the case type.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\". The Complaint already shows individual plaintiffs. But maybe the case was later amended to a class action, or another document clarifies that. However, the current extracted value is from the complaint, which lists Jane and John Doe as individual plaintiffs. The other documents might not change that, but I need to check.\n\nThe next step is to check if any other document has a different value. The Docket might have the case type. The Docket document is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I should read it to check. The Docket might list the case as a class action or individual. Since the complaint is individual, but sometimes cases can be amended.\n\nThe available actions: read_document on Docket (since it's unvisited), or search for \"Class Action\" or \"class action\" in the documents. But the problem says to use search_document_regex if the target is patternable. The term \"Class Action\" is specific, so maybe a regex search would be efficient.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"When a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document or search_document_regex.\" The Docket is likely to have case type info, so maybe read the Docket document. But the Docket might be large (7,588 tokens), but since it's unvisited, I can read it in parts. However, the system says to read ≤10,000 tokens, which the Docket is under (7,588), so reading the whole thing is okay.\n\nBut the previous step already read the Complaint, which was the first document. Now, the Docket is next. Alternatively, using search_document_regex for \"Class Action\" might find relevant sections faster. Let's see: the regex pattern could be \"Class Action\" or \"class action\" with IGNORECASE flag.\n\nBut the checklist item's value format is specific: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual...\". So the Docket might have the case type listed. The Docket entry might say \"Class Action\" or \"Individual Plaintiffs\".\n\nThe safest next step is to search all documents for \"Class Action\" or \"class action\" using search_document_regex. That way, I can find any mentions without reading the entire Docket first. If the search finds a match, then I can read that section. But since the Docket is unvisited, and it's likely to have the case type, maybe reading the Docket is better. However, the system prefers using search_document_regex for patternable targets.\n\nWait, the Decision Policy says: \"search_document_regex — use this when the target is clearly patternable (e.g., 'Case No.', 'Filed:', citations).\" Here, \"Class Action\" is a clear pattern. So using search_document_regex with pattern \"Class Action\" (case-insensitive) would be appropriate.\n\nSo, the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"Class Action\", doc_name='all' (since it's all documents), flags=['IGNORECASE'], top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nBut the user has to choose exactly one action. So the correct move is to call search_document_regex to look for any mention of \"Class Action\" across all unvisited documents. If it finds something, then read the relevant section. But since the current extracted value is individual, maybe the search will find no matches, confirming it's individual. But need to check.\n\nAlternatively, since the Complaint already shows individual, and other documents might not change that, but the user needs to ensure no other values exist. So searching for \"Class Action\" is the right step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Class Action\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Class Action", "doc_name": "all", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10119, "completion_tokens": 1068, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The evidence is from the first page where it says \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\".\n\nNow, looking at the current status, there's 1 key extracted. The next step is to check if there are more documents that might have more information. The available documents include \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response and Objection...\" which was partially visited. The regex search for \"Class Action\" found matches in that document, but they were only partially read (tokens 1795-1995, etc.). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nWait, the regex search was done on all documents, and it found 4 matches in that specific pleading. The matches mention \"class actions\" in the context of legal cases, like \"putative class actions\" and \"class certification\". But the key here is to determine if the current case is a class action or individual plaintiffs. The matches in the pleading might not be about the current case but references to other cases. For example, the text says \"several of the cases cited by the House involved putative class actions\" – so they're talking about other cases, not the current one.\n\nThe current case's complaint clearly states individual plaintiffs (Jane and John Doe), so the extracted value seems correct. But the user needs to make sure there's no other document that indicates it's a class action. The other documents like the Docket, Order, Notice, Motion, and Stipulation might have more info. However, the regex search didn't find any \"Class Action\" in those, but maybe they need to read them to confirm.\n\nWait, the regex search was on \"Class Action\" pattern, but the document \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response...\" had matches. But the matches were about other cases, not the current one. So maybe the current case is individual, and the regex matches are irrelevant. However, to be thorough, maybe they should check if the response document has any mention of the case being a class action.\n\nBut the current extracted value is already from the complaint, which is the initial filing. The complaint says \"JANE DOE and JOHN DOE, Plaintiffs,\" without any mention of a class. So it's individual. The other documents might be motions or orders that could change that, but the complaint is the starting point.\n\nThe next action should be to check if there are other documents that might have conflicting info. The document \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response...\" was partially visited, but the matches found were about other cases. The next step would be to read more of that document to see if it mentions the case being a class action. But since the regex matches were in the context of other cases, maybe it's safe to assume the current case is individual. However, the instructions say to extract all applicable items, so maybe they need to confirm.\n\nWait, the user's checklist is to extract the status. The complaint says individual, so that's the value. The other documents might not have the same info. The Stipulation for Dismissal might be relevant, but it's unvisited. But the regex search didn't find \"Class Action\" there, so maybe it's not a class action.\n\nWait, the current status shows 1 key with 1 value. The other documents are unvisited, but the regex search didn't find any relevant matches. The next logical step is to use `get_checklist` to verify if there are any other keys (but there's only one key). Wait, the checklist has only one item: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs.\n\nSo after appending the value from the complaint, the next step would be to check if there's more to extract. Since the regex search found mentions of \"class actions\" in other documents but not in the context of this case, maybe the value is already complete. However, to be safe, they should read the remaining parts of the partially visited document to ensure no mention of class action.\n\nThe document \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response...\" has 4,351 tokens, and they've viewed 15% (tokens 1795-1995, 2012-2212, 2413-2673). The next step would be to read more of that document, but since the regex matches were about other cases, maybe it's not necessary. However, the instructions say to systematically extract all applicable items. So perhaps they should read the rest of that document to confirm.\n\nBut the token ranges viewed are from 1795-1995, 2012-2212, 2413-2673. The next unviewed token would be after 2673. But the document is only 4,351 tokens, so they can read the remaining tokens (2673 to 4351) in one read_document call. But the maximum is 10,000 tokens, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but the regex search already found the matches, and the matches are in the context of other cases. So the current case is individual. Therefore, the extracted value is correct, and there are no more values to extract. The other documents might not have any relevant info. The Stop criteria is when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Since the key is filled with one value, and there's no indication it's a class action, the next step is to stop.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to make sure that there's no other document that says it's a class action. For example, the Stipulation for Dismissal might mention it, but the regex search didn't find \"Class Action\" there. The Docket or Order might have it, but the current state shows they haven't read those.\n\nHowever, the instructions say to use evidence from the documents. The complaint clearly states individual plaintiffs, and the other documents' regex matches refer to other cases. So the value is confirmed. Therefore, the checklist key is complete, and the next action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the checklist summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The Stop criteria is met.
