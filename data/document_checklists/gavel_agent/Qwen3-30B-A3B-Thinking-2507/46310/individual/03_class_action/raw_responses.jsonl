The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the documents in the corpus count is 0.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first. So the only valid action here is `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 192, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents, there's a \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" and a \"Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand\". These seem like the most likely places to find the class action status. The other documents are orders, motions, protective orders, etc., which might mention it but are less likely to be the primary source.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, so no values have been extracted yet. The user needs to start by reading one of the complaint documents. Since the \"Class Action Complaint\" is named explicitly, that's probably the best first document to check. The token count is 8,285, which is under the 10k limit, so reading the whole document is possible.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" document. Starting from token 0 to the end. That way, I can get the full text and look for any mention of class action status. If it's in the complaint, that's where it should be. If not, maybe the amended complaint. But starting with the first one makes sense.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so I need to check all documents, but since the complaint is the most relevant, that's the logical first step. Also, the document is unvisited, so no need to check for viewed tokens. Just read the whole thing.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` for that specific document. No regex needed yet because the document name suggests it's the right place. Using `search_document_regex` might be overkill here since the document is directly related. So the correct tool is `read_document` with the document name and the full token range.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8285}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8285}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3530, "completion_tokens": 465, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the provided legal documents. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The snapshot shows that \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty (0/1 keys with values), and the only document that's been read so far is the \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" (tokens 0-8285), which is marked as fully visited.\n\nLooking at the document content, I see the complaint clearly states: \"Andrew Alexander, Hubert Anderson, John Barnes, Steven Barnes, Jarred Baysinger, Maurice Bishop, Benny Blansett, Jason Bonds, Antonio Boyd, McKinley Brady, Darkeyus Brown, Christopher Burns, Cedric Calhoun, and Rayshon Darden, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs\". \n\nThe key phrase here is \"on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\" which explicitly indicates this is a class action. The plaintiffs are listed as individuals bringing the case on behalf of a class, not as individual plaintiffs. \n\nThe required format for the extracted value is either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since this is a class action, the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nI need to create evidence with:\n- Verbatim text: The phrase \"on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs\"\n- Source document: \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\"\n- Location: Page 1 (since it's the beginning of the document, and the token range was 0-8285)\n\nSince this is the first extraction and the value is confirmed, I should use `append_checklist` to add this entry. The checklist item is currently empty, so appending is the correct action here. \n\nI should not use `update_checklist` because this is the first entry and we're adding a new value, not replacing an existing list. Also, it's not \"Not Applicable\" since the class action status is clearly stated.\n\nThe document is already fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I don't need to read it again.

The user needs me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which requires specifying whether plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the current status: They've already extracted one value from the Class Action Complaint. The evidence shows \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from the complaint's introductory paragraphs. The document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again.\n\nThe task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The complaint clearly states it's a class action, but I need to check if other documents might contradict this or provide additional context. However, the checklist only asks for the designation, and the complaint explicitly says \"class action\" multiple times (e.g., \"class action complaint,\" \"on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,\" \"class action\").\n\nThe user's recent action was appending that one value. Now, since the complaint is fully visited and the value is confirmed, I should check if other documents could have different information. But the checklist item is singular—it's about how the plaintiffs are proceeding, not multiple designations. The complaint is the primary document establishing the case type.\n\nOther documents like \"Fifth Amended Complaint\" might be relevant, but since the initial complaint already states it's a class action, and no other documents have been read yet, I don't have evidence suggesting otherwise. The \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" might address the class action status, but without reading it, I can't confirm.\n\nWait—the current status shows all other documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). But the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is typically established in the complaint. The complaint already says it's a class action, so unless another document explicitly changes this (e.g., a court order certifying or decertifying), it's redundant to read other docs for this specific item.\n\nThe extraction process says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value.\" Since the complaint is the initiating document and states it's a class action, and no other document has been read that contradicts it, there's only one value to extract. The user already appended it via append_checklist.\n\nNow, the next step: The checklist summary shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are filled. The \"Not Applicable\" count is 0, and there are no empty keys. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. Since the one key is complete (with one value), and there's no indication it's Not Applicable (it's clearly a class action), I should stop.\n\nI should verify with get_checklist to confirm the state, but the instructions say to stop when all keys are filled. The recent action history shows they successfully appended the value, and the status reflects it's complete. There's no need to read more documents for this item because the value is already confirmed and no other distinct values exist (it's not \"individual plaintiffs\" since the complaint explicitly says class action).\n\nSo the correct action is to stop. The reason is that the only checklist item is fully extracted with supporting evidence, and no further documents need to be checked for this specific item.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are complete: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs has one confirmed value ('Plaintiffs: Class Action') with evidence from the fully visited complaint document.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are complete: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs has one confirmed value ('Plaintiffs: Class Action') with evidence from the fully visited complaint document.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12467, "completion_tokens": 724, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
