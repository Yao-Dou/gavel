The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data.

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty, and there are 13 unvisited documents. The main documents to check would be the Complaints since the filing date is likely in the initial complaint. The \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" and \"Fifth Amended Complaint\" are probably the most relevant. The Docket might also have the filing date.\n\nSince the documents are unvisited, I should start by reading one of the complaints. The first one, \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" is 8,285 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole document. But maybe the filing date is in the header or first few pages. To be efficient, I'll read the entire document since it's within the token limit.\n\nWait, the system says not to reread documents, but all are unvisited. So reading the first complaint makes sense. The filing date should be there. Let's call read_document on that document. Start at token 0, end at 8285. That's the whole doc. Then, after reading, I can check the text for the date and use append_checklist to add it with evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8285}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8285}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3480, "completion_tokens": 337, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state, and I need to figure out the next action.\n\nFirst, looking at the Recent Actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 13 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, tokens 0-8285. The text they read includes the line \"Case: 4:20-cv-00021-SA-JMV Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/10/20 1 of 15 PageID #: 3101\". So the filing date here is 02/10/20, which is February 10, 2020.\n\nThe current status shows that Filing_Date is empty, with 0 values extracted. The document they just read is marked as \"✓ Fully Visited\" with all tokens viewed (0-8285). So they've already read the document where the filing date appears.\n\nNow, the checklist item Filing_Date needs to be filled. The evidence is in the document they just read. The next step should be to append this value to the checklist. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe text snippet is \"Filed: 02/10/20\" on the first page. The source document is \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\", and the location is \"Page 1\" or \"tokens 0-8285\" but since it's the first page, maybe \"Page 1\" or \"Case header\".\n\nThe user's instructions say that after reading a document, if values are found, they should use append_checklist. Since this is the first value for Filing_Date, and they have the evidence, the next action should be append_checklist with the extracted value.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each entry needs text, source_document, location. The text would be \"Filed: 02/10/20\", source is the document name, location is probably \"Case header\" or \"Page 1\". The document is listed as \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial [Complaint]\".\n\nSo the append_checklist call should have key \"Filing_Date\", extracted list with one entry. The value is \"02/10/20\", but the requirement says to extract the calendar date. The date format is 02/10/20, which is February 10, 2020. But the checklist might want it in a specific format. The example in the text uses \"02/10/20\", so probably keep it as is.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"calendar date\", so maybe they want it as \"February 10, 2020\" but the document uses \"02/10/20\". The instruction says to extract the value as found, so \"02/10/20\" is acceptable. But the user's example in the snapshot shows the date as \"02/10/20\", so we'll use that.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"02/10/20\", evidence text is \"Filed: 02/10/20\", source_document is \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\", location is \"Page 1\" or \"Case header\". The document's page ID is 3101, but the location can be \"Page 1\" as per the document's page number (1 of 15).\n\nTherefore, the correct action is append_checklist with the value for Filing_Date.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"02/10/20\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed: 02/10/20\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\", \"location\": \"Case header, Page 1\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "02/10/20", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed: 02/10/20", "source_document": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "location": "Case header, Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12263, "completion_tokens": 876, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. From the recent actions, they already read the Class Action Complaint and found \"Filed: 02/10/20\" in the header. They appended that as Filing_Date.\n\nNow, checking the current status: all keys (just Filing_Date) are filled with one value. The document they read is marked as Fully Visited (✓), so they can't get more from it. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist only has Filing_Date. Wait, the requirement says to extract EVERY distinct value. But in legal cases, the filing date is usually only in the initial complaint. The other documents like Docket or Orders might have different dates, but the checklist specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed,\" which is the initial filing, not any subsequent dates.\n\nSo, the Filing_Date should only be the date from the first document. Since they already extracted that and the document is fully visited, there's no need to check others. The checklist summary shows 1/1 keys filled. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, Filing_Date has one value, which is correct. No other documents should have the initial filing date; other dates would be for motions or orders, not the original filing.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"every distinct value.\" Could there be multiple filing dates? Unlikely. The initial complaint's filing date is the one. The Docket might list the filing date again, but it's the same value. Since the problem says to extract every distinct value, and it's the same date, they don't need to add duplicates. The evidence they have is from the complaint, which is correct.\n\nAlso, the available documents: the other ones are unvisited, but since the filing date is already found and confirmed, reading more documents won't give new values. The system's policy says not to reread fully visited docs, and the others aren't necessary here.

The complaint header clearly states \"Filed: 02/10/20\" on page 1. No other documents would have the initial filing date - subsequent filings would have different dates.\n\nI should verify if there's any chance another document might contain a different filing date, but logically:\n- Complaint is the initial filing\n- All other documents (amended complaints, motions, orders) are subsequent to the initial filing\n\nThe system already confirmed \"All other documents are irrelevant to the initial filing date\" in the Current Status section.
