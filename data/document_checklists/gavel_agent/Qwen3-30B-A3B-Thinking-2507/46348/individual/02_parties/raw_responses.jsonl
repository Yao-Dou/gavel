The system says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, I can't read any documents because there are none.\n\nThe task requires extracting from the documents, but there are no documents listed. The next action should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since there are no documents discovered yet, the catalog is unknown. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the tools provided. The `list_documents` function doesn't require any parameters. So the next step is to call that function to discover what documents exist in the corpus. Once I have the list, I can proceed to read or search them. But right now, with no documents, I can't do anything else.

The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which requires listing plaintiffs and defendants with their roles.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Complaint) is probably the best place to start because complaints typically name the parties at the beginning. The other documents like Docket, Orders, and Motions might mention parties too, but the Complaint is the primary source.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The Complaint is 9,891 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call. So I should read the Complaint first. Since it's unvisited, I'll start with the beginning to find the party names.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That should cover the initial part where parties are listed. The Docket might have party info too, but the Complaint is the most direct source.

The task is to extract the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status, available documents, and the recent actions.\n\nFirst, looking at the Recent Actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 8 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, which was fully visited (tokens 0-9891). The text from that document shows the parties involved. The plaintiff is the American Foreign Service Association, and the defendants are Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity), Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio (in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator), and Charles Ezell (Acting Director of OPM).\n\nThe checklist item requires the values to be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. From the document, I can see that the plaintiff is AFSA, and the defendants are listed with their roles. So I need to extract each party with their correct role.\n\nThe current status shows that \"Who_are_the_Parties\" is empty. The document they read (Complaint) is fully visited, so they have the necessary info. Now, they need to append the extracted values to the checklist. The next action should be append_checklist with the entries for Plaintiff and each Defendant.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that after reading a document, if there are extractable values, the next action must be append_checklist or update_checklist. Since they have the values from the Complaint, which is the only document they've read so far, they should append the entries.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each entry needs evidence with text, source document, and location. The document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (Complaint), and the text snippets are from the document. The location can be the page numbers mentioned, like Page 1 of 20 for the parties listed.\n\nSo for Plaintiff: 'Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association, 2101 E Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20037' from Page 1. For each Defendant, like 'Defendant: Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States' from Page 1, etc.\n\nWait, the document lists them as:\n\nPlaintiff: American Foreign Service Association...\n\nDefendants: Donald J. Trump... Office of Personnel Management... etc.\n\nSo the extracted values should be formatted as specified. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", so the extracted entries should be:\n\n- Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association, 2101 E Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20037\n- Defendant: Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States\n- Defendant: Office of Personnel Management\n- Defendant: U.S. Department of State\n- Defendant: U.S. Agency for International Development\n- Defendant: Marco Rubio, in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator, United States Agency for International Development\n- Defendant: Charles Ezell, in his official capacity as Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management\n\nEach needs evidence. The text from the document shows these, so the evidence can reference the page numbers and the specific lines.\n\nThe document was read from tokens 0-9891, which covers the entire document, including the parties listed on Page 1. The evidence location can be \"Page 1 of 20\" for the initial listing, and maybe specific paragraphs for others, but the main parties are on Page 1.\n\nWait, looking at the text provided, the parties are listed on Page 1:\n\n\"AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE  : \nASSOCIATION,  : \n2101 E Street, NW  : \nWashington, D.C. 20037,  : \n:  COMPLAINT FOR \nPlaintiff,  :  DECLARATORY AND \n:  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nv.  : \n\nDONALD J. TRUMP,  : \nin his official capacity as  : \nPresident of the United States   : \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  : \nWashington, DC 20500,  : \n\nOFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT,  : \n1900 E Street, NW  : \nWashington, D.C.  20415,  : \n\n... and so on.\n\nSo the Plaintiff's description includes the address, but the checklist says \"descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So for Plaintiff, it's \"American Foreign Service Association\" with their address, but the example says \"Plaintiff: [description]\". The description here includes the address, so it should be included.\n\nSimilarly, for each Defendant, the description includes their capacity (e.g., \"in his official capacity as President of the United States\").\n\nSo the extracted values should include all that.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to the checklist. Since it's the first time, and there are multiple entries, append_checklist is the way to go. Each entry needs to have evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nFor example, for Plaintiff:\n\n- value: \"Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association, 2101 E Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20037\"\n- evidence: text from the document (the lines showing Plaintiff), source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location: \"Page 1 of 20\"\n\nSimilarly for each Defendant.\n\nThe document is fully visited, so no need to read more. The next action is append_checklist with all these entries.\n\nCheck if there are other documents that might have more parties. The other documents are unvisited, but the complaint is the initial pleading, which usually lists the parties. The other documents (like Motions, Orders) are likely about the case but might not list the parties again. The checklist says to extract every distinct value from any document, but the parties are typically listed in the complaint. Since the complaint is already read and has all the parties, the other documents probably don't add new party information. So appending the values from the complaint should be sufficient.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call append_checklist with the extracted values.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association, 2101 E Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20037\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE  : \\nASSOCIATION,  : \\n2101 E Street, NW  : \\nWashington, D.C. 20037,  : \\n:  COMPLAINT FOR \\nPlaintiff,  :  DECLARATORY AND \\n:  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 20\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Defendant: Donald J.
