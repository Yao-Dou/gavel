The user needs to extract court rulings from legal documents. The checklist item is Court_Rulings, and it's empty right now. There are 7 documents listed, all unvisited. The task is to find every distinct ruling mentioned.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which documents are most likely to contain the rulings. The document names give a hint. For example, \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" probably has the ruling details. Similarly, \"Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" would have a ruling on that motion.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I need to start reading them. But which one first? The complaint might have the motions filed, but the actual rulings are more likely in the order documents. The Docket might list the rulings, but the actual order documents (like the ones with \"Order\" in the name) are probably where the detailed rulings are.\n\nThe Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (12,521 tokens) seems a good candidate. The title mentions a TRO, so the ruling there would be granting the TRO. Similarly, the Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss would have a ruling on that motion.\n\nBut I need to read the documents to confirm. The user said not to reread, but all are unvisited. So the next step is to read one of the order documents. Let's pick the one with the TRO since it's a specific ruling. The Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. That's the document named \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order [Order/Opinion] - 12,521 tokens - ○ Unvisited\".\n\nSo, I should call read_document on that document. The start and end tokens need to be specified. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the entire document, but wait, the maximum is 10,000 tokens. The document is 12,521 tokens, so I can't read all at once. I'll have to split it. But the first read should be the first 10,000 tokens. Wait, the parameters for read_document require start_token and end_token. The document is 12,521 tokens, so start_token 0 to 10,000. But maybe the user expects me to read the whole document in parts, but the first step is to read a window. Since it's unvisited, start from 0.\n\nSo the action should be read_document with doc_name \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", start_token 0, end_token 10000. Wait, the max is 10,000 tokens, so end_token should be 10000. But the document is 12,521, so first read 0-10000, then maybe another read for 10000-12521. But for the first action, just read the first 10k tokens.\n\nWait, but the tool says \"read a targeted window (≤10,000 tokens)\", so I need to make sure the range is <=10k. So 0 to 10000 is 10k tokens. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the next action is to read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\".\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3542, "completion_tokens": 800, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the court rulings from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Court_Rulings\", which needs to be filled with specific decisions made by the court.\n\nLooking at the snapshot, the user has already read the first document, \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", up to token 10000. The document shows that the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order. The key part is on page 2, line 3: \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\"\n\nThe requirement is to extract each ruling as a separate value with evidence. So the ruling here is that the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order. The evidence should include the exact text, source document, and location.\n\nThe document is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but the relevant text is in that range. The next step is to append this value to the checklist. Since the user has found a value, they should use `append_checklist` to add this entry.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: need verbatim text, source document, location. The text snippet is \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\" The source is \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", and the location is page 2 (from the document's header: Page 2 of 16).\n\nSo, the extracted value should be \"GRANTED the motion for temporary restraining order\" (but the example says to state what the court ruled on, so maybe \"Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"). Wait, the instructions say to write each value so a reader can understand the ruling. The exact phrase in the document is \"GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order\", so the value should be \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nWait, the document says \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\" So the value is \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". The evidence needs the exact text, which is that line.\n\nThe location is page 2, so in the evidence, location should be \"Page 2 of 16\" or maybe \"Page 2\". The document's header shows \"Page 2 of 16\", so include that.\n\nNow, check if there are other rulings in the text. The document also mentions the hearing date, but that's not a ruling. The main ruling is the grant of the TRO. So only one value here.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Court_Rulings\", so the patch should have key \"Court_Rulings\" with the extracted value. Since it's the first value, append it.\n\nMake sure to use append_checklist, not update, because it's adding a new entry. The value is a list, so the extracted array will have one entry.\n\nEvidence: text is \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\" Source document is \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". Location is \"Page 2 of 16\".\n\nWait, the document's token range is 0-10000, which covers the first page up to page 2. The text is on page 2, so location should be specified as page 2.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist would have patch with key \"Court_Rulings\", extracted array with one item having evidence (text, source, location) and value.\n\nThe value should be \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" as the ruling. The exact text is \"GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order\", but the value should be a self-contained narrative. So the value is \"Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"For each ruling, state what motion or issue the court decided, how it ruled (e.g., granted, denied, etc.), who brought the motion (if clear), and the relevant date(s) if available.\"\n\nIn this case, the motion was brought by Plaintiffs, the ruling was granted, and it's a temporary restraining order. The date isn't in the text snippet, but the document is filed on 08/16/23, but the ruling is on that date. However, the example in the requirements says to focus on the ruling itself. So the value should be \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nBut the exact text in the document is \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\" So the value could be \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (since the motion is for TRO, and Plaintiffs brought it).\n\nSo the value is \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\nEvidence text: \"the Court hereby GRANTS the motion for temporary restraining order.\"\n\nSource: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"\n\nLocation: \"Page 2 of 16\"\n\nNow, check if the user should use append_checklist. Yes, because it's adding a new entry.

The current task is Step 4, and the checklist item to extract is \"Court_Rulings\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 7 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (tokens 0-10000). Step 3 was append_checklist, which added one entry for Court_Rulings.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Court_Rulings has 1 value, and there are 6 other documents unvisited. The next step should be to check if there are more court rulings in the remaining documents.\n\nThe document catalog shows that \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" is partially visited (80% coverage), but the user already read up to 10,000 tokens. The next logical step would be to read more of that document to see if there's additional information about court rulings. However, the problem says not to reread already viewed tokens. Since they read 0-10000, the next unvisited tokens would be 10001 onwards. But the document has 12,521 tokens, so there's about 2,521 tokens left. But the maximum per read_document is 10,000 tokens, so reading 10001-12521 would be okay.\n\nWait, but the checklist requires extracting every distinct value. The current extraction only has one value: \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". But maybe the document has more rulings. For example, later in the document, there might be other orders or rulings mentioned. The current read was up to page 13 (tokens 0-10000), but the document is 12,521 tokens, so there's a bit more. However, the user's read was up to page 13, but the document's tokens might not align exactly with page numbers. The key point is that the viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next step would be to read the remaining tokens (10001-12521) to check for more rulings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents have more rulings. For example, the \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might have additional rulings. But the user needs to prioritize. The current checklist only has one entry, and the next step should be to check if there's more in the same document first, since it's partially visited. But according to the decision policy, if a document is partially visited, read only unviewed tokens. So, the next action should be read_document for the same document, starting at 10001.\n\nWait, but the current read was 0-10000, and the document has 12,521 tokens, so the next token range would be 10001-12521. Let me confirm the token count: the document is listed as 12,521 tokens. So 10000 tokens read, 2521 left. So reading 10001-12521 (which is 2521 tokens, under 10k) is allowed.\n\nThe user should read the remaining tokens of the partially visited document to see if there's more court rulings. The previous extraction was from page 2, but maybe later pages have more rulings. For example, the document might have a final ruling or other sections. So the correct action here is to call read_document on the same document, starting at 10001.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents have more rulings, but the policy says to check the partially visited document first before moving to others.

The document is marked as \"Fully Visited\" (12,521 tokens, viewed 0-12521). The other 6 documents are unvisited.\n\nThe task is to extract EVERY distinct value of Court_Rulings.

The user is asking me to extract court rulings from legal documents. The current status shows that there's one checklist item: Court_Rulings, and it already has one value from the Temporary Restraining Order document. But the user provided a new document called \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" which has been partially read (only 0-10000 tokens). The next step is to check if there's more court rulings in the remaining part of that document.\n\nLooking at the Recent Actions, Step 5 was reading the first 10,000 tokens of that document. The text they provided ends at page 13, but the document has 50 pages. So there's more to read. The next action should be to read the next token range. The document is 40,323 tokens, and they've read up to 10,000, so the next part would be tokens 10001-20000. But I need to make sure not to exceed 10,000 tokens per read. So reading from 10001 to 20000.\n\nWait, the document is partially visited with 25% coverage (0-10000). The next chunk should be 10001-20000. I should call read_document for that range. The document name is \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" with tokens 0-10000 already read. So the next step is to read the next 10,000 tokens (10001-20000) to see if there are more court rulings. The previous action (Step 5) already read up to 10000, so the next read should start at 10001.\n\nI need to make sure that the start_token is inclusive and end_token exclusive. So start_token=10001, end_token=20001. Wait, but the maximum is 10,000 tokens. So 10001 to 20000 (10,000 tokens). Wait, 20000 - 10001 = 9999, which is 10,000 tokens? Wait, tokens are counted from start to end-1. So from 10001 to 20000 inclusive would be 9999 tokens. Wait, no, the range is inclusive start, exclusive end. So 10001 to 20001 would be 10,000 tokens (20001 - 10001 = 10,000). So the correct parameters are start_token=10001, end_token=20001.\n\nWait, the document has 40,323 tokens total. The first read was 0-10000 (10,000 tokens), so the next should be 10001-20000 (10,000 tokens). Wait, but the user's example in Step 5 used tokens 0-10000 for the first read. So the next one would be 10001-20000. But the parameters require start_token (inclusive) and end_token (exclusive). So start=10001, end=20001. Wait, 20001-10001=10,000. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on the Order Granting in Part... document with start_token=10001 and end_token=20001. That's the next step to get more content where the court rulings might be mentioned. The current extracted value is from the TRO, but the preliminary injunction order might have more rulings.

The document catalog shows that \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" is partially visited (50% coverage), and the rest are unvisited. The user needs to extract all distinct values for Court_Rulings, so I should check if the remaining parts of the preliminary injunction order contain more rulings.\n\nThe previous read_document for the preliminary injunction was tokens 0-20001, but the document is 40,323 tokens. So there's still 20,322 tokens left (20001-40323). I should read the next segment to see if there's another ruling mentioned.

The task is to extract court rulings from the legal documents.\n\nCurrent status:\n- We have one checklist item: \"Court_Rulings\"\n- We have one value extracted so far: \"GRANTED Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" from the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nThe document catalog shows:\n- We have read the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (fully visited, 100% coverage).\n- We have partially visited the \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" (74% coverage, tokens 0-30001).\n- The rest of the documents are unvisited.\n\nWe have read tokens 0-30001 of the \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" (which is the document we are currently partially visiting). In the provided text for Step 7, we see that the document has been read up to tokens 20001-30001.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are more court rulings in the partially read document (or in the unvisited documents) that we haven't extracted yet.\n\nLooking at the document we've partially read (the preliminary injunction order), we see that it contains a ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction. The court did not grant the motion in full but granted it in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court \"GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\"\n\nWe should extract this as a separate value for \"Court_Rulings\".\n\nThe evidence for this ruling is in the document (from the text we read in Step 7, which is the tokens 20001-30001). We see the ruling in the document:\n\n\"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\"\n\nAlso, note that the document is titled \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", so the ruling is explicit.\n\nWe need to create a new extracted value for \"Court_Rulings\" with:\n- Value: \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\"\n- Evidence: \n   - text: \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\"\n   - source_document: \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"\n   - location: \"Page 4 of 50\" (from the document header in the text we read, which is in the tokens 20001-30001 section: \"Case 3:23-cv-04085-EMC   Document 98   Filed 10/19/23   Page 4 of 50\")\n\nBut note: the document header in the text we read (in Step 7) shows \"Page 4 of 50\", so we can use that.\n\nHowever, note that the document we are reading is the same as the one we've partially read (tokens 0-30001). We have already read up to 30001 tokens, so we have the entire text of the ruling (which is in the beginning of the document, but we read it in the earlier tokens). However, the evidence we are about to extract is from the text we've already read (in the tokens 0-30001) but we haven't extracted it yet.\n\nBut note: the previous extraction (Step 3) was for the TRO, and we haven't extracted the preliminary injunction ruling.\n\nSo we have two distinct rulings:\n1. Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) granted (from the first document).\n2. Preliminary injunction: granted in part, denied in part (from the second document).\n\nWe must extract both.\n\nWe have already extracted the first one. Now we need to extract the second one.\n\nWe have the evidence from the document (the text we've already read in the document). So we can append the new value.\n\nTherefore, we should use `append_checklist` to add the new value for \"Court_Rulings\".\n\nBut note: the document \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" is partially visited (74% coverage, tokens 0-30001). We have read the entire document? Actually, the document is 40,323 tokens, and we've read 30,001 tokens (so 74% of 40,323 is about 30,000). We have the ruling in the first few pages (page 4, as per the header we see in the text). So we have the text.\n\nWe are going to append a new value for \"Court_Rulings\".\n\nWe must format the evidence as required.\n\nThe value we want to extract is: \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\"\n\nBut note: the checklist definition says: \"Focus on how the court ruled on key motions or issues, such as: granted/denied motions to dismiss, granted/denied summary judgment, issued preliminary injunctions or TROs, certified/denied class certification, or made other significant procedural or substantive rulings.\"\n\nSo for the preliminary injunction, the court granted in part and denied in part. We can phrase it as: \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\"\n\nWe have the exact quote: \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\"\n\nBut note: the document says \"a preliminary injunction\", so we should use that.\n\nSo the value: \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction\"\n\nNow, for the evidence:\n- text: \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\"\n- source_document: \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"\n- location: \"Page 4 of 50\" (as seen in the document header in the text we read)\n\nBut note: the document header we see in the text (in the tokens 0-10000 and 10001-20001) shows \"Page 4 of 50\" at the beginning of the document. However, the exact location in the document is page 4.\n\nWe have to be precise. The document header in the text we read (in Step 5) says \"Page 4 of 50\". So we can use that.\n\nNow, we must append this value to the existing \"Court_Rulings\" key.\n\nWe have one existing value (from the TRO) and we are adding a second value.\n\nSo the `append_checklist` call will have:\n- patch: [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 4 of 50\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n\nBut note: the existing value we extracted (the TRO) was from the first document. We are appending a new value from the second document.\n\nWe are not replacing the entire list, so we use `append_checklist`.\n\nWe are not setting Not Applicable, so we don't use `update_checklist`.\n\nWe have not read any other documents, but we don't need to because we have found the second ruling in the document we've already read.\n\nTherefore, the next action is `append_checklist` with the new value.\n\nWe must be cautious: the document we are reading is the same as the one we've partially visited, and we have the text, so we can extract it.\n\nLet's write the JSON for the tool call.\n\nNote: The `append_checklist` function expects a `patch` array of objects, each with \"key\" and \"extracted\" (which is an array of the new entries for that key).\n\nWe are appending one entry for \"Court_Rulings\", so the extracted array has one element (with the value and evidence).\n\nWe are not adding multiple keys, so the patch array has one object.\n\nSo the tool call is:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 4 of 50\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWe are confident that the text we are citing is present in the document (we read it in Step 5 and Step 6, and it's in the beginning of the document).\n\nTherefore, we choose `append_checklist`.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 4 of 50\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Court_Rulings", "extracted": [{"value": "GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.", "source_document": "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 4 of 50"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 39265, "completion_tokens": 2225, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is the \"Court_Rulings\" item. The task is to find every distinct value of this checklist item from the legal documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's already been extracted. From the provided history, there are two values for Court_Rulings:\n1. From the Temporary Restraining Order: \"GRANTED Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (mentioned in Step 3)\n2. From the Preliminary Injunction Order: \"GRANTED in part and DENIED in part Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\" (Step 8)\n\nWait, but looking at Step 8's description, it says they appended one value for Court_Rulings from the Preliminary Injunction Order. The first value was from Step 3 (TRO document), and this is the second value.\n\nNow, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", so they have two values for Court_Rulings. The user wants to make sure all applicable values are extracted.\n\nI need to check if there are more values to extract. The available documents include:\n- The Preliminary Injunction Order (Partially Visited, 74% coverage)\n- Other unvisited documents like the Verified Complaint, Docket, etc.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"NEVER reread token ranges already viewed.\" The Preliminary Injunction Order has been read up to 30,001 tokens (74% coverage), so there's still 26% left (30,001-40,323). However, the previous steps (Steps 5-7) already read tokens 0-30,001, so the next logical step would be to read the remaining tokens of that document to see if there's more Court_Rulings information.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Court_Rulings\" and they've already extracted two values. The TRO was granted, and the preliminary injunction was granted in part and denied in part. Are there more rulings in the remaining tokens?\n\nLooking at the document catalog, the Preliminary Injunction Order is partially visited (74% coverage), so I should read the remaining tokens (30,001-40,323) to check for additional rulings. The other documents (Complaint, Docket, etc.) might contain more rulings, but since the user's goal is to extract all values, I should prioritize reading the remaining part of the Preliminary Injunction Order first, as it's the most relevant document for rulings.\n\nWait, the document \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part...\" is the one that has the ruling on the motion, so it's the most likely place to find the ruling. The TRO was already covered in the first document.\n\nThe user's instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action, carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\" So I need to read the remaining tokens of the Preliminary Injunction Order to see if there's another ruling mentioned.\n\nThe current state shows that the Preliminary Injunction document has been read up to 30,001 tokens (74% coverage), so the next step is to read tokens 30,001-40,323 (which is within the 10,000 token limit per call). \n\nI should call read_document on \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" with start_token=30001 and end_token=40323.\n\nWait, the document is 40,323 tokens total, so end_token should be 40323. But the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens, so 30,001 to 40,323 is 10,322 tokens, which is over the limit. So I need to split it into two calls: 30,001-40,000 and 40,001-40,323. But since the next action must be one of the functions, and the user is to choose one action per turn, I should do the first part: tokens 30,001-40,000.\n\nBut the document has 40,323 tokens, so 30,001 to 40,000 is 9,999 tokens (40,000-30,001=9,999), which is under 10,000. So the correct call would be start_token=30001, end_token=40000.\n\nWait, the problem says \"maximum range: 10,000 tokens per call\", so 40,000-30,001=9,999 tokens, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on that document with tokens 30001-40000.\n\nThe user's current status shows that the Preliminary Injunction document is partially visited (viewed 0-30001), so reading the next 10,000 tokens would be the next step.\n\nI should not use search_document_regex because the target is a specific ruling mentioned in the document, and it's not a patternable regex (like a case number), but rather a narrative ruling. So read_document is the right choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document with the specified tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 30001, \"end_token\": 40000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 30001, "end_token": 40000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 39336, "completion_tokens": 1286, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
