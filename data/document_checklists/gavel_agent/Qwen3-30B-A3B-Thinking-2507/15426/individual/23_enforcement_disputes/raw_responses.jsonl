So the only valid action is list_documents. Let me check the tools again.

The user needs to find all disputes related to enforcing settlements, not decrees. The checklist item is Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this info. The Docket documents (both standard and PACER) usually list motions and court actions, so they're prime candidates. The Complaints and Amended Complaints might mention settlement disputes, but the Dockets are more likely to have the specific motions like \"Motion to Enforce Settlement\" or \"Contempt Motion.\"\n\nThe current state shows all documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). Since there are 14 documents, I shouldn't read all at once. The Docket and Docket [PACER] documents are the top priority because they list court entries. The Docket entries often have entries like \"Motion to Enforce Settlement filed by Plaintiff on [date]\" which would directly relate to the checklist item.\n\nI should use search_document_regex to look for key phrases like \"enforce settlement,\" \"motion to enforce,\" \"contempt,\" or \"settlement enforcement.\" But the user mentioned using regex for patternable items. Let me check the regex parameters. The pattern should be specific, maybe something like r\"enforce[^\\n]*settlement\" or \"motion to enforce settlement\". But the exact pattern needs to be precise.\n\nWait, the example says to avoid broad patterns. So maybe use a regex that targets common phrases. Let me think: \"motion to enforce settlement\" is a standard phrase. Also, \"contempt for noncompliance with settlement\" might come up. But to keep it focused, start with \"enforce settlement\" as the pattern. The flags can include IGNORECASE since case might vary.\n\nThe search_document_regex function allows searching specific documents or all. Since the Docket and Docket [PACER] are most relevant, maybe search those first. But the function parameters let me specify doc_names as an array. So I'll set doc_names to [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"] to target those two documents. The pattern could be \"enforce settlement\" with IGNORECASE flag.\n\nWait, the pattern parameter is required. Let's go with \"enforce[\\\\s\\\\w]*settlement\" to catch variations like \"enforce the settlement\" or \"enforce settlement terms.\" But maybe better to use a more precise pattern. Alternatively, \"motion to enforce settlement\" is a common phrase. Let's use that as the pattern.\n\nSo the regex pattern would be \"motion to enforce settlement\" with IGNORECASE. That should find exact matches. Using top_k=5 to get the top 5 matches per document. Context tokens around 200 to see the surrounding text.\n\nThis should efficiently find the relevant entries without reading entire documents. Once the matches are found, I can then read the specific sections using read_document if needed, but first, the regex search should pinpoint the locations.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"motion to enforce settlement\", doc_names [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"], flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"motion to enforce settlement\", \"doc_names\": [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"], \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "motion to enforce settlement", "doc_names": ["Docket", "Docket [PACER]"], "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3588, "completion_tokens": 734, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is trying to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes related to enforcing a settlement, not decrees. They've already done a search for \"motion to enforce settlement\" in two documents (Docket and Docket [PACER]) but found zero matches.\n\nHmm, the current status shows that all 14 documents are unvisited. The previous search didn't yield any results, so maybe the exact phrase isn't used. Maybe the disputes are referred to differently, like \"motion to enforce\" or \"enforcement motion\" without the word \"settlement.\" Or perhaps they're mentioned in the context of other motions.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket entries (Docket and Docket [PACER]) are the most likely places to find such disputes, since dockets list all filed motions. But the regex search for \"motion to enforce settlement\" didn't find anything. Maybe the pattern needs to be adjusted. The user should try a broader regex that includes variations. For example, \"motion to enforce\" might be more common than the exact phrase with \"settlement.\" Or maybe \"enforcement motion\" or \"motion for enforcement.\"\n\nWait, the problem says to exclude disputes over decrees, so the key is to find motions specifically about settlements. But maybe the documents use different terminology. The regex should be more flexible. Let's consider using a regex like \"motion to enforce(?: settlement)?|enforcement motion\" to catch variations. But the search_document_regex tool requires a pattern, so the assistant needs to specify that.\n\nThe previous search used \"motion to enforce settlement\" which is too specific. The next step should be to search with a more general pattern. Since the Docket documents are the most relevant, maybe search those first. The Docket and Docket [PACER] are the two documents where such motions would likely be listed. But the previous search on those two found nothing. Wait, the recent actions say the search was done on [Docket, Docket [PACER]] and found 0 matches. So maybe the pattern was too narrow.\n\nThe assistant should try a different regex. Let's think of common phrases. \"Motion to enforce settlement\" might be written as \"motion to enforce the settlement\" or \"enforcement of settlement.\" Maybe the regex should be \"motion to enforce(?: the )?settlement\" to account for \"the.\" Alternatively, maybe \"settlement enforcement motion.\"\n\nBut the user's instruction says to use precise, anchored patterns. So perhaps \"motion to enforce settlement\" is the right phrase, but maybe the documents use \"settlement\" in a different context. Wait, the problem states that settlements are negotiated agreements not entered as court orders, so the motions would refer to that. If the search didn't find anything, maybe the documents don't have such motions, but the assistant shouldn't assume that yet. They need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting every distinct value. If there are no such disputes, then the key should be marked as Not Applicable. But the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. So the assistant must first confirm that no such disputes exist.\n\nBut the current state shows 0 values, and all documents are unvisited. The previous search was too specific. So the next logical step is to perform a more comprehensive search. The assistant should try a broader regex on all documents. The pattern could be \"motion to enforce settlement\" but maybe with more flexibility. However, the tool's example uses \"Case No.\" as a pattern, so maybe a regex that matches variations.\n\nWait, the problem says \"motions to enforce, motions for contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction\" related to settlements. So the key terms are \"enforce,\" \"settlement,\" and maybe \"motion.\" So a regex like \"motion (to enforce|for enforcement|for contempt) settlement\" might work. But that's getting complex. Alternatively, search for \"enforcement\" and \"settlement\" in close proximity.\n\nBut the search_document_regex tool allows specifying a pattern. The assistant should use a pattern that's likely to capture the relevant terms. Let's try \"motion to enforce settlement\" but maybe the documents use \"settlement\" without \"the,\" so the regex could be \"motion to enforce\\s+settlement\" to allow any whitespace. But the previous search didn't find anything, so maybe the actual term is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the disputes are not called \"motions\" but are part of other filings. The Docket might list them under \"Motion\" entries, so searching for \"enforcement\" in the Docket entries could help. The assistant should search the Docket and Docket [PACER] documents with a pattern like \"enforcement\" or \"settlement enforcement.\"\n\nWait, the previous search was specifically for \"motion to enforce settlement,\" which is a bit long. Maybe the correct approach is to first search for \"enforcement\" in the Docket documents, since enforcement motions would be listed there. So the pattern could be \"enforcement\" and then check the context.\n\nGiven that the previous search on a specific phrase didn't work, the next step is to use a more general regex to find any mentions of enforcement related to settlement. The assistant should use search_document_regex with a pattern like \"enforcement(?: motion)?(?: settlement)?\" across all documents, but focusing on the Docket entries first since they're most relevant.\n\nWait, the available documents include two Docket files, which are the most likely places. So the assistant should search those two with a broader pattern. The pattern could be \"enforcement\" and \"settlement\" together. But regex might need to be precise. Maybe \"enforcement.*settlement\" to find instances where enforcement is followed by settlement.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's previous search used \"motion to enforce settlement\" and got zero matches. So perhaps the documents don't have that exact phrase. The assistant needs to try a different pattern. Let's think: maybe the motion is titled \"Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement\" or something similar. So the pattern could be \"motion to enforce settlement\" but allowing for \"agreement\" or other words. But the regex should be precise.\n\nAlternatively, the term might be \"settlement enforcement\" as a phrase. So the pattern could be \"settlement enforcement\" or \"enforcement of settlement.\"\n\nWait, the checklist says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement,\" so the key is \"enforcing a settlement.\" So the phrase might be \"enforcing a settlement\" or \"enforcement of settlement.\"\n\nThe assistant should try a regex like \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\" to capture those variations.\n\nGiven that the previous search was too specific, the next step is to perform a search with a more flexible regex on the relevant documents. Since the Docket entries are the most likely places to find such motions, the assistant should search those two documents (Docket and Docket [PACER]) with the new pattern.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\" on the Docket and Docket [PACER] documents. But the tool's parameters allow specifying doc_names as an array. The previous search used [Docket, Docket [PACER]], so the assistant can do the same here with a different pattern.\n\nWait, the tool parameters for search_document_regex have \"doc_name\" which can be a single name or 'all', or \"doc_names\" as an array. The previous search used doc_names: [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"]. So the assistant should use doc_names with those two documents and the new pattern.\n\nThe pattern should be something like \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\" to catch variations. Using regex flags like IGNORECASE might help, but the default is case-sensitive. Since legal documents might have mixed case, maybe adding IGNORECASE flag would be good. But the problem says to use precise patterns, so maybe not. But the previous search didn't use flags, so maybe include IGNORECASE to be safe.\n\nWait, the parameters allow flags as an array. So the assistant can add \"IGNORECASE\" to the flags. But the instructions say to use precise, anchored patterns. However, for a search, it's common to use IGNORECASE for case insensitivity.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n- pattern: \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\"\n- doc_names: [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"]\n- flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]\n\nThis should capture variations in case and the specific phrases. Let's check if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"motion to enforce settlement\" is still the correct phrase, but the previous search missed it due to some typo. But since it's zero matches, the assistant should try a broader search.\n\nThe current status shows all documents are unvisited, so the next step after a failed specific search is to try a broader regex on the most relevant documents. Hence, the correct action is to call search_document_regex with the new pattern on the Docket documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\", \"doc_names\": [\"Docket\", \"Docket [PACER]\"], \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement", "doc_names": ["Docket", "Docket [PACER]"], "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3630, "completion_tokens": 1962, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The user has already tried two regex searches: one for \"motion to enforce settlement\" and another for \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\" on the Docket and Docket [PACER] documents, but found zero matches.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The previous searches were on Docket and Docket [PACER], but maybe the relevant info is in other documents like the Memorandum Opinions or the Complaints. The regex searches might have been too narrow. For example, maybe the disputes are mentioned in the opinions or the memorandum opinions, not just in the docket.\n\nThe checklist item specifies disputes about enforcing a settlement, excluding decrees. So, the key is to find terms like \"motion to enforce settlement,\" \"enforcement of settlement,\" \"contempt motion,\" \"retained jurisdiction,\" etc. The previous regex patterns might not have covered all possible phrasings. Maybe the terms are phrased differently, like \"enforcement of the settlement\" or \"settlement enforcement.\"\n\nSince the regex searches on the docket didn't work, maybe I should try a broader search. But the user's policy says to use precise patterns. Wait, the previous searches used \"motion to enforce settlement\" and \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\" which are pretty specific. But maybe the documents use different wording. For example, \"enforcement of the settlement agreement\" or \"motion to enforce the settlement.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the disputes are in the Memorandum Opinions. The Memorandum Opinions are listed as unvisited, so they might contain the relevant information. The user should read a document that's likely to have the disputes, like the Memorandum Opinions.\n\nWait, the previous step tried searching Docket and Docket [PACER], but maybe the actual disputes are detailed in the opinions. So, the next logical step would be to read one of the Memorandum Opinions, since they're likely to contain court opinions discussing settlements and enforcement.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Memorandum Opinion (001) is 23,200 tokens. Since the maximum read per call is 10,000 tokens, I can read the first 10k tokens of that document. But the user's policy says not to reread, but since it's unvisited, it's okay. So, the next action should be to read_document on Memorandum Opinion (001), starting at token 0, ending at 10,000.\n\nWait, but the user might want to check if there's a better document. The Docket might have the motions listed, but the regex searches on docket didn't find anything. Maybe the docket entries mention the motions, but the regex patterns were too narrow. Alternatively, maybe the disputes are in the Complaint or Amended Complaint. But the Complaints are more about the initial claims, not enforcement disputes.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement,\" so these would be motions filed after a settlement was reached, so probably in the docket or in the opinions. Since the docket searches didn't find anything, maybe the opinions have the details. So, reading a Memorandum Opinion makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct action here is to use read_document on Memorandum Opinion (001) for the first 10,000 tokens. That's the most logical next step.

The user needs me to extract all disputes related to settlement enforcement from the provided documents. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the current status. The checklist item \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is completely empty (0 values extracted), and the only document partially read so far is \"Memorandum Opinion (001)\" from tokens 0-10000. The recent actions show they've already done two regex searches on docket documents for terms like \"motion to enforce settlement\" but found zero matches.\n\nHmm... the key here is that the user's checklist specifically excludes disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments), so I need to be careful not to include those. The document they've read so far (Memorandum Opinion) is about a class action lawsuit regarding license suspensions for unpaid court fees - it's discussing statutory interpretation of Virginia law, not settlement enforcement disputes. \n\nLooking at the text they provided, I don't see any mentions of \"settlement\", \"enforcement\", \"motion to enforce\", or similar terms. The document is about jurisdictional issues and statutory construction, not about enforcing negotiated agreements. The only related terms are \"settlement\" in the context of \"settlement agreement\" but that's not about enforcement - it's about the legal framework for license suspensions.\n\nSince the regex searches already failed to find any matches in docket documents, and the only document read so far contains no relevant content, I should probably search the remaining documents. But wait - the document catalog shows 14 documents total, and they've only read one partially. The other documents include \"Complaint\", \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\", and \"Preliminary Injunction\" which might contain settlement enforcement references.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"When reading partially visited documents, read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" Since they've only read 0-10000 tokens of Memorandum Opinion (001), I could read the next token range (10000-20000) to see if there's relevant content later. However, the previous search patterns already covered \"enforcement of settlement\" and found nothing, so it's unlikely to help.\n\nWait - the checklist definition says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\". The document they've read is about a lawsuit challenging a statutory scheme, not about a settlement agreement. So probably no relevant content here.\n\nGiven that, and since they've already done two regex searches on docket documents with zero results, the most efficient next step is to search the complaint documents where settlement enforcement disputes might be mentioned. The \"Complaint\" and \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" are the most likely candidates.\n\nI should use `search_document_regex` on these complaint documents with a pattern like \"motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement\" to find potential matches. The pattern should be precise to avoid false positives. Since they're looking for settlement enforcement disputes, this pattern should work.\n\nThe document catalog shows \"Complaint\" and \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" are both unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I can search those. I'll specify the document names in the search to be efficient.\n\nSo my next action should be `search_document_regex` targeting the complaint documents with the appropriate pattern.

Since the previous searches on Docket didn't find matches, but maybe reading a specific part of it could help.

However, the regex patterns used might not have been precise enough. Maybe they should try a different pattern, but the instructions say to use regex only when the target is clearly patternable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the document they need to read is another Memorandum Opinion. For example, Memorandum Opinion (002) is 5,610 tokens, which is less than 10k, so they can read the whole thing. But since they've already read 0-10k of (001), and (002) is smaller, it's a candidate.\n\nBut the user's current status shows that they've done 5 steps, and the next action should be to read a document. The previous read was Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 0-10000. Since that's partially visited, they shouldn't reread it. The next step is to pick another unvisited document. The Docket [PACER] is unvisited, but maybe it's better to try a document that's more likely to have settlement disputes. The Docket might list motions, so perhaps searching the Docket for settlement-related terms.\n\nWait, they already did a regex search on Docket and Docket [PACER] with \"motion to enforce settlement\" and found 0 matches. So maybe the Docket doesn't have it. The other documents like the Complaint might have the allegations, but the regex search didn't find anything. However, the regex pattern they used was \"motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement|settlement enforcement\". Maybe they need to look for \"settlement\" in the documents, but the pattern might have missed some variations.\n\nBut according to the decision policy, if the target is clearly patternable, use search_document_regex. But they already tried that. Since the searches came up empty, maybe they should read a document that's likely to have settlement mentions. The Complaint might mention settlement discussions, but the regex didn't find it. Maybe they should read the Complaint in full.\n\nThe Complaint is 25,182 tokens, so they can read it in chunks. Since it's unvisited, they can start reading from 0-10000. The next step would be to call read_document on Complaint, tokens 0-10000. That's a standard approach when previous searches didn't find anything, but the document might have the info.\n\nWait, the current step is to choose one action. The available options are to read a document, search again, or get checklist. Since the previous searches didn't find anything, and the document catalog is known (they listed 14 documents), the next step is to read a document that hasn't been visited.

Alternatively, maybe the other unvisited documents have the relevant info.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", which refers to disputes about enforcing a settlement agreement (not a court order). So I need to look for terms like \"motion to enforce settlement\", \"enforcement of settlement\", etc. But the regex searches didn't find anything. However, the user's prior actions used regex on Docket documents but got 0 matches. Maybe the actual document names are different, or the terms are phrased differently.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the unvisited ones include Docket, Docket [PACER], and others. The Docket documents are likely where such motions would be listed. Since the regex searches on those two documents returned 0 matches, but maybe the actual text has the phrases but the regex didn't catch them due to case sensitivity or other factors. But the regex was case-insensitive (since the flags weren't specified, but the default might be case-sensitive). Wait, the tool's search_document_regex allows flags, but the user's prior searches didn't specify flags. So maybe the regex should include IGNORECASE.\n\nBut the current step is to decide the next action. The user has tried searching on Docket and Docket [PACER] with the regex, but found 0 matches. Maybe they should try a more precise search or read the documents to confirm. However, the current status shows that the Docket documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), so the regex search was done on them, but found nothing. Wait, the search was done on those documents, so the search function would have scanned them. But since it returned 0 matches, perhaps those documents don't contain the terms. But the user needs to check other documents.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", which is about disputes related to enforcing a settlement. The documents provided so far (Memorandum Opinion, Complaint) are about a different case where the plaintiffs are challenging the suspension of licenses, not about settlement enforcement. So maybe the relevant documents are the Docket entries or other orders that mention settlement enforcement motions.\n\nBut the prior regex searches on Docket and Docket [PACER] found nothing. Maybe the next step is to search other documents. But the regex searches were done on the Docket documents, which are the most likely places. Alternatively, maybe the term is phrased differently, like \"enforcement motion\" or \"settlement enforcement\". The user tried \"enforcement of settlement|enforcing a settlement\", but maybe they should try a different pattern.\n\nWait, the tool's search_document_regex allows specifying doc_names. The prior searches were on [Docket, Docket [PACER]], but perhaps the actual document names are different. Wait, the available documents list \"Docket\" and \"Docket [PACER]\" as separate, so the regex was correctly applied to those two.\n\nGiven that the regex searches on those two documents found 0 matches, but the checklist item is empty, maybe there are no such disputes in the corpus. However, the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. So the user can't assume it's Not Applicable yet; they need to check all documents.\n\nBut the user has 14 documents. They've read the Complaint (0-10000) and Memorandum Opinion (0-10000), and searched Docket and Docket [PACER] with regex. The other documents are unvisited. So the next logical step is to search the remaining documents for the regex pattern. Wait, but the regex was already done on the two Docket documents, which are the most likely places. However, maybe the user should try a broader search or check other documents.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement. The case here is about license suspensions, not about a settlement. So it's possible that there are no such disputes in the documents. But the user can't assume that; they have to check all documents.\n\nWait, the user has 14 documents. They've partially visited two (Complaint and Memorandum Opinion), and the Docket documents were searched (found 0 matches). The other 10 documents are unvisited. So the next step might be to search all documents again with a more precise regex, but the prior search on Docket documents returned 0. Alternatively, maybe the user should read the Docket documents fully, but the regex search already covered them.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex was used on Docket and Docket [PACER], which are the two documents where such motions would be listed. Since the search found 0 matches, it's likely that there are no such disputes. But to be thorough, maybe the user should use get_checklist to confirm that the key is still empty, but the instructions say to stop only when all keys are filled or marked Not Applicable. Since the key is empty and no evidence was found, the user might need to set it to Not Applicable, but they can't do that yet without confirming all documents.\n\nWait, the user has to check all documents. They haven't read all documents yet. The Docket documents were searched (so they've been checked for the regex), but maybe they should use search_document_regex on all documents to make sure. The tool's search can be done with doc_name='all' to search all documents.\n\nWait, the prior searches were on specific documents (Docket and Docket [PACER]), but maybe the user should search all documents. However, the current step is to choose one action. The available documents include 12 unvisited ones. But the regex search on the two likely documents found nothing. So perhaps the next step is to do a search on all documents with the same regex to be thorough.\n\nBut the tool allows searching all documents with doc_name='all'. So the next action could be a search_document_regex with pattern \"motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement|settlement enforcement\" and doc_name='all' to cover all documents. But the user has already searched two documents, so maybe it's redundant, but to be safe, they should search all.\n\nAlternatively, since the two Docket documents are the most relevant, and the regex found nothing, maybe the key is Not Applicable. But the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. The problem is, the user has to make sure they've checked all possible documents.\n\nWait, the user has 14 documents. They've searched two (Docket and Docket [PACER]) and found nothing. They've read two others (Complaint and Memorandum Opinion) which are about a different case, so unlikely to have settlement enforcement disputes. The other 10 documents are unvisited, but they're all opinions or statements of interest, which might not contain the terms. But to be thorough, they should search all documents.\n\nBut the user's current step is to choose one action. The best next step is to perform a search on all documents with the regex to confirm no matches. So the action would be search_document_regex with pattern \"motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement|settlement enforcement\", doc_name='all'.\n\nWait, the prior searches were on [Docket, Docket [PACER]], but maybe the actual documents are named differently. The available documents list \"Docket\" and \"Docket [PACER]\" as separate. So using doc_name='all' would search all 14 documents. But the user has already searched two of them. However, the search_document_regex tool can handle that, and it's better to do a full search.\n\nSo the next action should be to call search_document_regex with doc_name='all' to check all documents for the pattern. If that returns 0 matches, then they can set the key to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure they're not missing any documents. So the correct next action is to search all documents for the regex pattern.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"search_document_regex\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n    \"pattern\": \"motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement|settlement enforcement\",\n    \"top_k\": 5,\n    \"context_tokens\": 200\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "motion to enforce settlement|enforcement of settlement|settlement enforcement", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24904, "completion_tokens": 2101, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes related to enforcing a settlement, excluding disputes over decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, all previous searches for \"motion to enforce settlement\" or similar phrases in the Docket and Complaint documents came up with zero matches. The user has already read parts of the Memorandum Opinion and Complaint, but those documents are about license suspensions due to unpaid court fees, not settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nThe key here is that the case seems to be about a class action lawsuit challenging Virginia's driver's license suspension policy for unpaid court costs. There's no mention of settlements or enforcement of settlements in the excerpts provided. The documents describe the plaintiffs' claims, the legal arguments, and the court's reasoning, but nothing about negotiated settlements or motions to enforce them.\n\nThe user has tried searching for relevant terms multiple times across different documents, and all searches returned zero matches. The Memorandum Opinion (001) and Complaint excerpts don't contain any settlement enforcement disputes.
