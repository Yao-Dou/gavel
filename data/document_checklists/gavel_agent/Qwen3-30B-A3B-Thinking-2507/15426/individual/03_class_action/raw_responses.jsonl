The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The current status shows that there are no documents discovered yet. The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the documents in the corpus count is 0.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first.

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The Complaint and First Amended Class Action Complaint seem most relevant since they're about the lawsuit's initiation. The \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" probably has the class action designation right there. The other documents like Dockets or Opinions might mention it, but the complaint is the primary source.\n\nSince the catalog is known (14 documents listed), I shouldn't use list_documents again. The next step is to read a document. The \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" is named with \"Class Action\" in it, so it's a strong candidate. Let's read the beginning of that document to find the class action status. The token count is 20,792, so I'll start from the beginning (tokens 0-10,000) to check the initial sections where the plaintiff's status is usually stated.\n\nI should use read_document for the First Amended Class Action Complaint, start_token 0, end_token 10000. That's within the 10k token limit. After reading that, I can check the text for mentions of class action or individual plaintiffs. If it's there, then I can append the value. If not, maybe check the Complaint next. But since the amended complaint includes \"Class Action\" in the title, it's likely to have the status confirmed there. So, the first action should be to read that document's start.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3561, "completion_tokens": 408, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they already read the first 10,000 tokens of the \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\". The document starts with the plaintiffs listed as \"Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated; Williess Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated\". \n\nSo, the key part here is \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\" which indicates a class action. The plaintiffs are named, but they're suing as a class. The complaint is titled \"FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", which is a strong indicator. \n\nThe user needs to extract this as \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The evidence should include the verbatim text from the document. The location would be the beginning of the complaint, probably page 1. The source document is \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\".\n\nWait, the document says \"individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated\" multiple times. So the key phrase is \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\", which is standard for class actions. The extracted value should be \"Class Action\" since they're representing a class.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of individual plaintiffs only. But the document clearly states it's a class action complaint. The plaintiffs are named, but the action is as a class. So the value is \"Class Action\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the exact text. The relevant part is: \"Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated; Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:\"\n\nSo the key phrase is \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\". The location would be the first page, maybe the first paragraph. The source document is the First Amended Class Action Complaint.\n\nSince this is the first document read, and it's clearly a class action, the next step is to append this to the checklist. The checklist item is empty, so using append_checklist to add the entry.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says to format as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...'. So the extracted value should be \"Class Action\", and the full formatted string would be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But the instruction says the extracted value should be the part after \"Plaintiffs: \", so \"Class Action\".\n\nWait, no. The example says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" as the extracted value. So the entire string should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". Let me check the checklist definition again.\n\n\"Extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value to extract is the full string. So in the evidence, the value would be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nThe evidence should have the text snippet where this is stated. The exact text from the document where it's clear it's a class action.\n\nThe document's title is \"FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", which is a strong indicator. Also, the first paragraph says \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\", which is the standard language for a class action.\n\nSo the evidence text would be the title and the first paragraph. But the user needs the verbatim snippet. The title is \"FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", and the first line of the complaint says \"Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)...\"\n\nSo the key part is \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\". The source document is \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\", location is page 1 (since it's the start of the document), and token range 0-10000, but the exact location might be the beginning.\n\nWait, the read_document was from tokens 0-10000, which includes the title and the first paragraph. The evidence location can be \"Page 1\" or \"Title and first paragraph\".\n\nBut according to the evidence requirements, location should be \"page, section, docket entry; include token offsets if available\". Since the document was read from 0-10000 tokens, and the relevant text is at the start, maybe \"tokens 0-1000\" or something. But the problem is, the exact token positions aren't provided in the snapshot. The user just says \"tokens 0-10000\" for the read.\n\nIn the evidence, the location can be \"Page 1\" as per the document's page numbering (which shows \"Page 1 of 45\" in the header). So location: \"Page 1\".\n\nSo the evidence entry would have text: \"Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:\"\n\nBut the key part is \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\", so the text should be that snippet. However, the evidence needs to be the verbatim text, so including the surrounding context might be necessary. But the instruction says \"verbatim snippet\", so the exact part where it's stated.\n\nAlternatively, the title \"FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" is also a strong indicator, so maybe include that. But the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, so the text where they say \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\" is more direct.\n\nSo, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and the evidence text would be the sentence containing \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\".\n\nWait, the value should be the formatted string. So the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and the evidence is the text that supports it.\n\nTherefore, the evidence's text field should be the relevant part from the document, like \"on behalf of all others similarly situated\", but the full sentence might be better.\n\nIn the document, the first paragraph says: \"Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:\"\n\nSo the verbatim text is that line. The location is \"Page 1\" as per the document's page numbering.\n\nSo, the evidence entry would have:\n\ntext: \"Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:\"\n\nsource_document: \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 1\"\n\nvalue: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\"\n\nWait, but the value is the formatted string. So the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", which is derived from the document's language.\n\nYes. So the append_checklist action should add this entry.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nSo the next action is to append this to the checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:\",\n                \"source_document\": \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Class Action", "evidence": [{"text": "Plaintiffs Damian Stinnie, Melissa Adams, and Adrainne Johnson, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, and Williest Bandy, and Brianna Morgan individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), state as follows for their First Amended Complaint:", "source_document": "First Amended Class Action Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14241, "completion_tokens": 1879, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need to extract is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the First Amended Class Action Complaint. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" with evidence from the first page of the complaint. The document is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but there's more text in the document that hasn't been read yet (since it's 20,792 tokens total, and they've only read up to 10,000).\n\nWait, the document is marked as \"Partially Visited\" with viewed tokens 0-10000. The next step would be to read the remaining tokens to see if there's more relevant information. The user's recent action was reading tokens 0-10000, and the evidence they found was in that range. But maybe the document has more details about the class action status later on.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting every distinct value. Since they found \"Class Action\" already, but the document might have other mentions or maybe a different designation. However, the complaint's title is \"FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", so it's clearly a class action. The plaintiffs are listed as proceeding on behalf of others similarly situated, which confirms it's a class action.\n\nWait, the user's extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", which matches the complaint's title. The document has 20,792 tokens, and they've only read the first 10,000. But the evidence they used is from the beginning (Page 1), so maybe the rest of the document doesn't add new information about the class action status. However, the instructions say to extract all distinct values. Since it's a class action, there's only one value here. But maybe they need to check if there's any part where it's described as individual plaintiffs. But the complaint is clearly a class action.\n\nThe available documents include other documents like Docket, Memorandum Opinions, etc. But the user's current task is to extract from the legal documents, and the checklist item is likely covered in the complaint. The other documents might not have the same information. For example, the Docket might list the case as a class action, but the complaint is the primary document where the status is established.\n\nThe user's previous step was to append the checklist with the value from the complaint. Now, they need to check if there are other documents that might have the same or different information. But according to the document catalog, the complaint is the main one. The other documents are Docket, Memorandum Opinions, etc. The Docket might have a case type, but the complaint is the one that explicitly states it's a class action.\n\nWait, the user's current status shows 1 key with 1 value, and all other keys are empty, but there's only one checklist item. So the task is complete. But wait, the system says \"extract every distinct value\", but there's only one value here. The complaint is a class action, so the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The user has already appended that. Now, they need to check if there are other documents that might have a different value. For example, maybe a later document like a Memorandum Opinion states it's a class action or not. But the instructions say to extract from all documents, so maybe they should check the Docket or other documents to confirm.\n\nWait, the Docket might list the case as a class action. Let me think. The Docket is a record of the case, so it might have the case type. But the user's current action is to decide whether to read another document or stop.\n\nThe user has already extracted the value from the complaint. The complaint's title and the text confirm it's a class action. The other documents might not add new information for this specific checklist item. For example, the Docket might say \"Class Action\" in the case description, but the user's checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is established in the complaint.\n\nSince the checklist item is already filled with one value (Class Action), and there are no other possible values (since it's a class action, not individual), the task is complete. The user should stop after confirming that no other documents need to be checked for this item.\n\nWait, but the system says to check all documents. The user has only read the complaint so far. The Docket document is unvisited. Maybe the Docket has a line stating the case type. For example, in court dockets, they often note \"Class Action\" in the case description. So the user might need to check the Docket to see if it also confirms the class action status, but the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is already established in the complaint. However, the requirement is to extract every distinct value from any document, so even if multiple documents say the same thing, it's still the same value. So appending the same value multiple times isn't necessary. The extracted value should be unique per value.\n\nSince the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and it's already extracted from the complaint, even if the Docket says the same thing, it's redundant. The user shouldn't append the same value again. The checklist requires distinct values, so only one entry is needed.\n\nThe user has already appended it once. The next step would be to check if there are any other documents that might have a different value (like \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), but given the complaint is a class action complaint, it's unlikely. The other documents like Memorandum Opinions might refer to the case as a class action, but again, it's the same value.\n\nTherefore, the user should stop because the checklist item is filled, and there are no other values to extract. The current status shows 1 key with 1 value, and the total values extracted is 1. The system's stop criteria is when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Since this is the only key and it's complete, the user should stop.\n\nWait, but the system's instructions say to stop when all applicable checklist items are fully extracted. In this case, there's only one item, and it's filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The user's recent action was append_checklist, which successfully added the value. Now, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The next step is to stop. The user shouldn't read more documents because there's no need. The evidence from the complaint is sufficient, and no other values exist.\n\nSo the correct response is to stop with the reason that the checklist item is fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs is fully extracted with one value ('Plaintiffs: Class Action') from First Amended Class Action Complaint (Page 1), matching the complaint's title and description.
