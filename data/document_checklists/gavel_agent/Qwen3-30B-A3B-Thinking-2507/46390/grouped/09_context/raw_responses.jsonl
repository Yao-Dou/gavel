The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown. Since the document catalog is unknown (it's showing 0 documents), the first step should be to call list_documents to find out what documents are available.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So definitely, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action is to list the documents first. I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents exist.

The user needs to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the provided documents. The checklist item definition includes facts, evidence, and background information. \n\nFirst, I check the current status: all keys are empty, and there are 13 unvisited documents. The main goal is to find where the factual basis is described. Since the checklist is empty, I need to start by reading a document that likely contains this information.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"Complaint\" (Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief) is a strong candidate because complaints typically detail the factual basis of a case. It's 10,707 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call if I take the first part. But wait, the maximum per call is 10k tokens, so I can read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint.\n\nThe other documents like Orders or Motions might have some facts, but the Complaint is the primary place where the plaintiff states the facts. So, reading the Complaint first makes sense. I'll use read_document on the Complaint, starting at token 0, ending at 10000. That covers most of it without exceeding the token limit.\n\nNo need for regex search here since the document type suggests it's the right place to start. The user hasn't provided any prior evidence, so the first step is to read the Complaint. I should avoid reading the entire document at once since it's 10k+ tokens, but the first 10k tokens should contain the factual basis. If not, I can read more later, but the policy says to read up to 10k tokens per call.\n\nSo, the next action is to call read_document on the Complaint with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint]\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint]", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3672, "completion_tokens": 479, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the legal documents. From the snapshot, I see that the checklist item is defined as the facts or evidence supporting the case, including events, evidence, and background.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 2 was a `read_document` on the Complaint (Class Petition) from tokens 0-10000. The provided text is the beginning of the complaint. I need to check if this document contains the factual basis.\n\nReading through the complaint, sections like \"INTRODUCTION\" (paragraphs 1-6) and \"BACKGROUND\" (paragraphs 23-57) seem to detail the events, evidence, and context. For example:\n\n- Paragraph 1 mentions Petitioners are Venezuelan men at risk of removal under a Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.\n- Paragraphs 3-5 describe the Proclamation's content, its basis (Tren de Aragua as a foreign government), and the government's actions (deporting 137 noncitizens).\n- Paragraphs 11-12 detail Petitioners' personal facts: D.B.U. was at a party raided by ICE/DEA, accused of TdA affiliation; R.M.M. fled Venezuela due to gang threats, has tattoos.\n- Background section (23-57) explains the AEA's historical use, the Proclamation's invocation, and legal arguments.\n\nThese all fit the checklist definition. The factual basis includes specific events (the March 14 Proclamation, March 15 deportation), evidence (tattoos, party raid), and background (historical AEA use, Venezuela's situation).\n\nSince the read_document covered tokens 0-10000 (93% of the document), and the relevant facts are in the first 22 pages (as per the page numbers in the text), I should extract these as evidence. The checklist item can have multiple values, so I'll list each key fact with its evidence.\n\nI need to structure the extracted entries with:\n- `value`: The factual basis point\n- `evidence`: Verbatim text snippet, source document, location\n\nFor example:\n- Value: \"Venezuelan men detained at Denver Contract Detention Facility at risk of removal under Proclamation invoking Alien Enemies Act\"\n- Evidence: Text from para 1, source: Class Petition..., location: pg 1\n\nI'll check if all relevant facts are covered in the read portion. The document seems to cover the core facts up to the class allegations (para 60+), so I should extract those.\n\nNow, since the text is already read, my next action should be `append_checklist` to add these entries. I'll create multiple extracted entries for different factual points, each with proper evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each extracted value should be self-contained,\" so I'll break it into distinct factual items. Let's list them:\n\n1. Proclamation details (para 3-5): Proclamation signed March 14, 2025, invoking AEA against Venezuelans as alien enemies based on TdA affiliation.\n2. Petitioners' personal circumstances (para 11-12): D.B.U. at party raided by ICE/DEA, accused of TdA; R.M.M. fled Venezuela due to gang threats, has tattoos.\n3. Historical context of AEA (para 23-37): Only used in three wars (1812, WWI, WWII), not applicable here.\n4. Government's process (para 51-52): Alien Enemy Validation Guide using unreliable tattoos/gestures.\n5. Impact (para 58): Over 130 removed without notice to El Salvador prison.\n\nEach of these is a distinct factual basis point. I'll create separate entries for each.\n\nNow, for evidence formatting:\n- `text`: Exact quote (e.g., \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) are Venezuelan men in immigration custody at risk of imminent removal under the President’s Proclamation...\")\n- `source_document`: \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint]\"\n- `location`: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS, Document 1, pg 1\"\n\nI need to ensure each entry has all three evidence parts. Also, since this is the first extraction, I'll use `append_checklist` (not `update`) because it's adding new values.\n\nNo need for `get_checklist` first since I've already analyzed the text. The next step is to append the extracted values.\n\nDouble-checking: The document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but the relevant facts are within that range (up to pg 22 as per the text). No need to read more of this doc yet.\n\nSo, the action is `append_checklist` with multiple entries for the factual basis.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Venezuelan men detained at Denver Contract Detention Facility at risk of imminent removal under Proclamation invoking Alien Enemies Act\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) are Venezuelan men in immigration custody at risk of imminent removal under the President’s Proclamation—signed in secret on March 14, 2025, and published the next day—invoking the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation’s history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint]\",\n                \"location\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS, Document 1, pg 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Petitioners D.B.U. and R.M.M. falsely accused of Tren de Aragua (TdA) affiliation based on tattoos and party attendance\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Petitioner D.B.U. is a thirty-two-year-old Venezuelan national who is detained at the Denver Contract Detention Facility, and who, having been erroneously alleged to be a member of Tren de Aragua, is at imminent risk of removal under the Proclamation. ...
