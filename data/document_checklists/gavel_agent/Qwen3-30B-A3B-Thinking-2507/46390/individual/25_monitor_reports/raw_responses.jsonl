The user is trying to extract monitor reports from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Monitor_Reports\", and they need to find all distinct values formatted in a specific way.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: there are 0 documents in the corpus. The system says \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available. The task requires checking the document catalog, but since there are none listed, I should call list_documents to get the list of documents. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, use list_documents. Since the corpus is empty, that's the case here. I can't read or search documents without knowing what's available. So the correct action is to call list_documents. No other actions make sense here because there are no documents to read or search. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The user mentioned \"Legal Checklist Extraction\" and the checklist item, but without any documents, there's nothing to process. So the next step is definitely to list the documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3134, "completion_tokens": 239, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract Monitor_Reports from the legal documents. The checklist item is Monitor_Reports, and the value should be formatted as 'Monitor found [compliance/non-compliance] with [specific requirement] as of [date].'\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where to look. The available documents include several orders and motions. The user mentioned that Monitor_Reports are reports explaining compliance with court orders. So, the relevant documents are probably the Orders (like Order (001) to Order (005)) because they might have monitor reports attached or referenced.\n\nThe current status shows that Monitor_Reports is empty, and all documents are unvisited. The next step is to read a document that's likely to contain the monitor reports. Since the Orders are the court's decisions, they might include monitoring reports. But the Orders themselves might not have the monitor reports; maybe the monitor reports are in separate documents. Wait, the documents listed include \"Order (001)\" etc., but the monitor reports might be part of the pleadings or motions. However, the user specified that the Monitor_Reports are from the legal documents, so maybe the monitor reports are included in the Orders or in the pleadings.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"Monitor's report explains whether a defendant is complying with a court order.\" So the monitor report would be a separate document, perhaps a report filed by a monitor. But looking at the document list, there's no document named \"Monitor Report\" explicitly. The available documents are Complaint, Docket, Orders, and various motions and briefs. Maybe the monitor reports are part of the Orders or included in the pleadings.\n\nSince the Orders are the court's orders, they might reference compliance reports. For example, an order might say \"Monitor reports that compliance is found...\" So the Orders are the best candidates to check first. The first Order listed is Order (001) with 19,585 tokens. It's the largest document, so likely to have detailed content.\n\nThe user's previous step was list_documents, which found 13 documents. Now, the next action should be to read a document. The decision policy says to choose a specific document likely to contain the target value. Since Monitor_Reports are related to compliance with court orders, the Orders are the most relevant. So, I should read Order (001) first. Since it's unvisited, I'll start by reading the entire document, but since the token limit is 10,000 per read, I need to split it. But the document is 19,585 tokens, so I'll read the first 10,000 tokens first. Wait, the read_document function requires start and end tokens. The document is unvisited, so start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so the viewed tokens are empty. So the first read should be from 0 to 10000. Then, if needed, read the next part. But the instruction says to read a targeted window of up to 10,000 tokens. So I'll call read_document on Order (001) for tokens 0-10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for keywords like \"monitor report\" or \"compliance\" in all documents. But the decision policy says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. The required format is specific, so maybe looking for phrases like \"Monitor found\" or \"compliance\" would help. However, since the user says \"Monitor_Reports\" is the checklist item, the value should be in a specific format. But the regex might help find where such reports exist.\n\nBut the policy says to prefer read_document first if a specific document is likely. Since the Orders are court orders, which would be the context where compliance is monitored, it's better to read Order (001) first. So the next action should be read_document for Order (001), tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, but the user's example in the decision policy says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. However, the checklist item's format is very specific, so maybe a regex like \"Monitor found (compliance|non-compliance) with [^ ]+ as of \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" could be used. But the problem is that the regex might not be precise, and it's better to first check the most relevant document.\n\nGiven that the Orders are the court's orders, and the monitor reports would likely be referenced in those orders, reading Order (001) first makes sense. So the correct action here is to call read_document on Order (001) with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3581, "completion_tokens": 1072, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract Monitor_Reports from legal documents, but so far none have been found. The snapshot shows that the only document read so far is Order (001) from tokens 0-10000, and it's only 51% covered. The checklist item \"Monitor_Reports\" is completely empty.\n\nFirst, I should check if the current document (Order (001)) has any mention of monitor reports. The text provided is from pages 1-18 of the order, and I need to scan for phrases like \"monitor's report,\" \"monitor found compliance,\" etc. The required format is \"Monitor found [compliance/non-compliance] with [specific requirement] as of [date].\"\n\nLooking through the text, I don't see any explicit mentions of monitor reports. The document is about a court order regarding immigration detainees, discussing the Alien Enemies Act, but there's no reference to a monitor or compliance reports. The government talks about notice procedures, but not a monitor's findings.\n\nSince the document is partially visited (only 51% read), maybe the monitor report is in the unvisited portion (tokens 10001-19585). But the user's task is to extract from all documents, so I should consider if other documents might contain the monitor reports. The available documents include things like \"Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"Class Petition,\" but those are pleadings, not orders with monitor reports.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Monitor_Reports,\" which is a specific type of document. In legal contexts, a monitor might be appointed to oversee compliance with a court order. The current document (Order (001)) is a court order, but it doesn't mention appointing a monitor. The other documents listed (like Docket, Orders 002-005) might have more details, but they haven't been read yet.\n\nThe next logical step is to continue reading the current document to check the unvisited tokens. Since the document is partially visited, reading the next token range (10001-20000, but capped at 10,000 tokens) makes sense. The maximum per read is 10,000 tokens, so starting at 10001 up to 20000 (but the document is 19,585 tokens, so it would go up to 19585).\n\nI should call read_document on Order (001) for tokens 10001-20000. This will cover the remaining 49% of the document. If there's a monitor report there, it'll be found. If not, then I'll need to check other documents. But since the user's task is to extract all monitor reports, and none have been found yet, proceeding with the current document is the most efficient next step.\n\nThe other option would be to search for regex patterns like \"monitor found\" or \"compliance report,\" but the text hasn't been read yet, so it's better to read the document first. The current document is the only one partially read, so continuing with it is prioritized.\n\nSo the next action is read_document for Order (001) from 10001 to 20000 (but since the document ends at 19585, it'll be 10001-19585).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14033, "completion_tokens": 789, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The document is a court order about immigration detention under the Alien Enemies Act. Let me scan for any mention of \"monitor\" or reports from a monitor.\n\nScanning through the text:\n- The document mentions \"Monitor\" in the context of the court order, but not as a monitor report.\n- There's no section titled \"Monitor Report\" or similar.\n- The order discusses notice requirements and compliance with the Act, but doesn't mention any monitor's findings.\n\nKey phrases I'm looking for:\n- \"Monitor found [compliance/non-compliance] with [specific requirement] as of [date].\"\n- \"Monitor report\" or similar terms\n\nAfter thorough reading of the entire Order (001), I don't see any such monitor report.

The task is to extract Monitor_Reports from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting distinct values formatted as 'Monitor found [compliance/non-compliance] with [specific requirement] as of [date].'\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty. The user has already read Order (001) and Docket, but the Docket is fully visited and Order (001) is fully visited. The documents that are unvisited include things like Class Petition, Order (002), etc.\n\nWait, but the user needs to find Monitor_Reports. The key here is to check if any of the documents mention a monitor's report. The Order (001) and Docket have been read, but the Docket is a timeline of filings, and the Order is the court's decision. The Order (001) mentions \"Monitor\" in the context of the court's order, but I don't see any specific monitor reports.\n\nWait, the Order (001) says: \"Respondents shall provide a twenty-one (21) day notice to Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class detained pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. It must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review, and inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government’s intent to remove them. Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.\"\n\nBut that's about notice requirements, not a monitor's report. The Monitor_Reports checklist item is about a monitor explaining compliance with the court order. The Order (001) doesn't mention a monitor's report. The Docket has entries like \"Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order,\" but nothing about a monitor.\n\nThe other unvisited documents include things like \"Class Petition,\" \"Order (002),\" \"Appellants-Respondents' Reply,\" etc. Maybe one of those has a monitor report. But the user has to choose one action. Since the Docket and Order (001) are fully visited and no Monitor_Reports were found, the next step is to read another document. The next document to read would be the one most likely to contain the monitor report. The \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\" might have some details, but it's a complaint. Alternatively, maybe \"Order (002)\" or another order.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions have read Order (001) and Docket. The next step is to read another document. The available documents are listed, and the unvisited ones are the rest. The most likely candidates for a monitor report might be in the orders or in the pleadings. But since the user has to pick one, the next logical step is to read another document. The document with the highest token count might be the most likely to contain the report, but the token counts vary. Alternatively, the user might use a regex search for \"monitor\" or \"report\" to find the relevant parts.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document or search_document_regex.\" Since the target is \"Monitor_Reports,\" which is a specific term, maybe using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"Monitor\" or \"monitor report\" would be efficient. But the user is supposed to choose one action.\n\nLooking at the documents, the \"Appellants-Respondents' Reply to Response to Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" has 5,796 tokens. Maybe that's a good candidate, but it's not clear. Alternatively, the \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" might have some details.\n\nWait, the Order (001) is the main order, and the Docket is the timeline. The Monitor_Reports are likely to be in a separate document, like a monitor's report filed as part of the case. Since the user has already read the main order and the docket, the next step is to check the other documents. But since there are many, using a regex search might be better to find where \"monitor\" appears.\n\nThe regex search could be done with pattern \"monitor\" or \"Monitor\" to find mentions. But the user has to choose between read_document or search_document_regex. Since the user hasn't found any yet, and the target is specific, using search_document_regex might be more efficient to find where \"monitor\" is mentioned.\n\nThe policy says: \"Use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable.\" Since \"Monitor_Reports\" is the key, the pattern could be \"Monitor\" or \"monitor report.\" So the best action here is to use search_document_regex with pattern \"Monitor\" to find all instances across documents.\n\nWait, the user should search all documents (since they don't know which one has it) or specific ones. The pattern could be \"Monitor\" to find all mentions. The parameters for search_document_regex would be pattern \"Monitor\", doc_name \"all\", top_k 5, context_tokens 200.\n\nBut the user has to choose one action.

The previous steps have read Order (001) and Docket, but the regex search for \"Monitor\" found 0 matches.

The regex search on all documents (step 5) came up empty. But maybe the term \"Monitor\" isn't used—perhaps it's \"monitor\" or \"monitors\" or a different phrasing. The checklist definition says \"a monitor's report,\" so maybe the document uses \"monitor\" as part of a title or section.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that the search was done with \"Monitor\" (capitalized), but maybe the actual text uses lowercase \"monitor\" or a different term.

However, the previous search didn't specify flags, so it was case-sensitive. But the user's instruction says to use precise patterns, so maybe the search was correct.\n\nBut the search returned 0 matches. So the term \"Monitor\" isn't in the documents. Wait, but the checklist item is called \"Monitor_Reports,\" so the actual document might not have that exact string. Maybe the reports are referred to as \"monitoring reports\" or \"monitor's report\" but not \"Monitor_Reports.\"\n\nWait, looking at the documents that haven't been read yet: there are several orders and motions. The Order (001) was fully read, but maybe the Monitor_Reports are in another document. The Docket was read too, but it's a docket entry, not a report.\n\nThe next logical step is to check other documents. The unvisited documents include Order (002), Order (003), etc. But maybe the Monitor_Reports are in one of those. Since the regex search on all documents didn't find anything, perhaps the term isn't present, but the user might have made a mistake in the pattern.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Monitor's report explains whether a defendant is complying with a court order.\" So maybe the actual document uses \"monitor\" as a noun, like \"the monitor's report,\" not \"Monitor_Reports.\" The regex search used \"Monitor\" which is a specific term. Maybe it's better to search for \"monitor\" (lowercase) or \"monitor's\" or \"monitoring.\"\n\nBut the previous search used \"Monitor\" as the pattern. The tool's description says to use precise patterns. However, since the search returned 0, and the checklist item is about monitor reports, perhaps the correct pattern is \"monitor\" or \"monitoring.\"\n\nWait, the user's step 5 used `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Monitor\" and found 0 matches. So maybe the term isn't there. But the task is to extract Monitor_Reports, so if there are no such reports in the documents, then it should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the system says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So if there's no mention of any monitor reports, then it's Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the current status shows \"Monitor_Reports\" is empty. The system hasn't found any evidence yet. So the next step is to check if there's any document that might contain this. The unvisited documents are all candidates, but the regex search on all documents was done. However, the regex might not have been the right pattern. For example, the pattern \"Monitor\" might not match \"monitor\" in the text.\n\nBut the user's previous action was `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Monitor\" and 0 matches. So maybe the correct approach is to use a different pattern. But the decision policy says: \"use `search_document_regex` when the target is clearly patternable.\" If the target is \"Monitor_Reports,\" but the actual term used is \"monitor,\" then the pattern should be \"monitor\" (lowercase) or with IGNORECASE.\n\nWait, the search parameters allow flags like IGNORECASE. So maybe the previous search should have used that. But since the user's step 5 didn't specify flags, it's case-sensitive. So perhaps the correct next step is to do another `search_document_regex` with a pattern of \"monitor\" and IGNORECASE flag.\n\nBut the current state shows that all documents have been searched (the search was on all documents), but with the wrong case. So the next action should be to search again with a more flexible pattern.\n\nWait, the available documents list shows that some are unvisited, but the regex search was done on all documents. So the search was performed on all 13 documents. If the search returned 0 matches, then there's no \"Monitor\" (case-sensitive) in any document. But maybe the term is present in lowercase.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to do another `search_document_regex` with pattern \"monitor\" and IGNORECASE flag to capture any case variations.\n\nBut the user's previous step was `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Monitor\" (capital M). So to be thorough, the next search should use a pattern that's case-insensitive for \"monitor.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the checklist item is called \"Monitor_Reports,\" but the document might use \"monitor\" as a common noun, the pattern should be \"monitor\" with IGNORECASE.\n\nSo the correct action now is to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"monitor\" and flags [\"IGNORECASE\"] to find all instances of \"monitor\" regardless of case.\n\nWait, but the system says: \"Prefer precise, anchored patterns tied to document structure; avoid broad multi-term OR patterns.\" So \"monitor\" is a single term, which is precise enough.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to do a regex search for \"monitor\" with IGNORECASE to find any mentions of monitor reports.\n\nBut the current status shows that the search for \"Monitor\" returned 0, so trying with \"monitor\" might find something.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no mention of \"monitor\" at all, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But according to the rules, we can't mark it as Not Applicable until we've exhausted all possibilities. Since the regex search was done but with a case-sensitive pattern, we need to redo it with case-insensitive.\n\nSo the next step is to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"monitor\" and flags [\"IGNORECASE\"].\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"monitor\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "monitor", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 31627, "completion_tokens": 1461, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The regex search used \"Monitor\" (capitalized), which would miss lowercase instances.

And `append_checklist`/`update_checklist` isn't applicable yet since we haven't found any evidence. \n\nSo the next action is `search_document_regex` with the corrected pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"monitor\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"doc_name\": \"all\"}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "monitor", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "doc_name": "all"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 31662, "completion_tokens": 549, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract Monitor_Reports from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting values formatted as 'Monitor found [compliance/non-compliance] with [specific requirement] as of [date].'\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty except Monitor_Reports, which is empty. The prior actions have read the Docket and Order (001) documents, but both are fully visited. The search_document_regex attempts for \"Monitor\" and \"monitor\" found 0 matches. The available documents include 13, but 2 are fully visited (Docket and Order 001), and the rest are unvisited.\n\nWait, the problem says to extract Monitor_Reports, but the search for \"Monitor\" and \"monitor\" didn't find anything. The user's prior steps tried searching for those terms but got 0 matches. However, maybe the term isn't exactly \"Monitor\" but part of a phrase. For example, maybe \"monitor's report\" or \"monitor report\" without the capital M. But the regex searches were for \"Monitor\" and \"monitor\", which should cover both cases.\n\nWait, the regex pattern in Step 5 was \"Monitor\" (capitalized), Step 6 was another search (but not specified, maybe same), and Step 7 was \"monitor\" (lowercase). All found 0 matches. So the term \"monitor\" (in any case) isn't present in the documents. But the checklist item is \"Monitor_Reports\", so perhaps the actual term in the documents is \"monitor's report\" or similar.\n\nBut the search didn't find anything. The next step would be to check other documents. The unvisited documents include things like Class Petition, Order (002), etc. Maybe the monitor reports are in one of those.\n\nWait, the available documents list includes \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus...\" and other orders. But the user has to read them. Since the prior searches didn't find the term, maybe the term is present in one of the unvisited documents. The next logical step is to read one of the unvisited documents. But which one? The user should pick a document that's likely to contain monitor reports. The document names like \"Order (002)\" might be relevant, but the problem is that the checklist item is about monitor reports, which might be a separate document. However, the user has to check all documents.\n\nWait, the current status shows that 0 values have been extracted. The user has to find if any of the unvisited documents contain the term. Since the regex searches on all documents found nothing, maybe the term isn't there. But the user needs to confirm by reading the documents.\n\nWait, the regex search might have missed it if the pattern wasn't exact. For example, if the document says \"monitor report\" but the regex was \"Monitor\" (case-sensitive), but the search used \"monitor\" (lowercase) in step 7. Wait, step 5 was \"Monitor\" (capital M), step 7 was \"monitor\" (lowercase), so both cases should have been covered.\n\nBut maybe the term is \"Monitor\" as part of a longer phrase. For example, \"Monitor's report\" would have \"Monitor\" followed by an apostrophe. The regex \"Monitor\" would match \"Monitor's\" as well, because the regex is looking for the string \"Monitor\", and \"Monitor's\" contains \"Monitor\". So the regex should have found it.\n\nBut the search returned 0 matches. So perhaps the term \"Monitor\" doesn't appear in any document. But the checklist item is \"Monitor_Reports\", which might mean that the reports are called \"Monitor Reports\" but the actual text might refer to it differently.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are no mentions of \"monitor\" in any document, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user needs to confirm that.\n\nThe current status shows Monitor_Reports is empty. The user has checked the Docket and Order (001) which are fully visited, and searched all documents for \"Monitor\" and \"monitor\" with no results. The remaining documents are unvisited, but the regex search on all documents (step 7) already covered them. Wait, step 7 was \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: 'monitor')\", which found 0 matches. So all 13 documents were searched, and no matches. Therefore, there are no occurrences of the word \"monitor\" (case-insensitive, since the regex flags might have been set, but the problem statement says the pattern was \"monitor\", so probably case-insensitive? Wait, the regex flags in the tools include IGNORECASE, but the user didn't specify. The step 7 says pattern: \"monitor\", and the flags default to empty. So the regex would be case-sensitive. So \"Monitor\" (capital M) wouldn't match \"monitor\" (lowercase), and vice versa. But the user did two searches: step 5 was \"Monitor\" (capital), step 7 was \"monitor\" (lowercase), both found 0. So even considering case sensitivity, no matches.\n\nTherefore, the term \"monitor\" (in any case) isn't present. But the checklist item is \"Monitor_Reports\", which might be a specific term. However, if the documents don't contain the word \"monitor\" or \"Monitor\", then there's no report to extract. So the correct action would be to set Monitor_Reports to Not Applicable.\n\nBut according to the Not Applicable Encoding rules, it must be set via update_checklist with a single entry value \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence. The evidence needs to be explicit. For example, \"No monitor reports found in any document\" or similar.\n\nWait, the user has already done the regex searches on all documents and found 0 matches. So the evidence for Not Applicable would be the search results showing no matches.\n\nSo the next step is to use update_checklist for Monitor_Reports with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the search.\n\nBut the user hasn't yet confirmed that all documents were checked. Wait, step 7 was a search on all documents (pattern: \"monitor\") which found 0. So that's sufficient evidence that no monitor reports exist.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to update the checklist with Monitor_Reports as Not Applicable.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Monitor_Reports\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Search across all 13 documents using regex patterns 'Monitor' and 'monitor' returned 0 matches\", \"source_document\": \"All documents\", \"location\": \"Document catalog search (Steps 5-7)\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Monitor_Reports", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "Search across all 13 documents using regex patterns 'Monitor' and 'monitor' returned 0 matches", "source_document": "All documents", "location": "Document catalog search (Steps 5-7)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21301, "completion_tokens": 1445, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
