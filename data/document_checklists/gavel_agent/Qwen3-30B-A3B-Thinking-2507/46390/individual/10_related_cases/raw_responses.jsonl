The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The checklist item is empty right now, and there are 13 unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain case codes. Looking at the document list, the \"Docket\" document is probably the best place to start because dockets often list related cases with their case numbers. The other documents like Complaints or Motions might mention related cases, but the Docket is the central place for case references.\n\nThe Docket has 7,370 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read. Since it's unvisited (○ Unvisited), I should read the whole document. Wait, but the policy says not to reread unvisited documents, and the Docket is unvisited, so reading it makes sense.\n\nI need to use read_document. The parameters are doc_name, start_token, end_token. Since it's unvisited, start_token is 0 and end_token is the full token count. The Docket's token count is 7,370, so end_token should be 7370. Wait, the description says end_token is exclusive, so to read the whole document, start=0, end=7370.\n\nWait, the document's token count is 7,370, so the tokens go from 0 to 7369. So end_token should be 7370. So start_token=0, end_token=7370.\n\nI should call read_document on \"Docket\" with those tokens. That's the most efficient next step to find related case numbers. The other documents might have them too, but starting with the Docket is logical.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7370}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7370}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3551, "completion_tokens": 422, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket document has been fully read (tokens 0-7370), and the extraction is empty. The other 12 documents are unvisited. The Docket entry mentioned in the recent actions has some case references. Let me check the Docket text again.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 10 says: \"See also Vizguerra-Ramirez v. Choate, et. al, Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5 (collecting cases); F.T.C. v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 603 (1966); Local 1814, Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n v. New York Shipping Ass'n, 965 F.2d 1224, 1237 (2d Cir. 1992).\"\n\nSo here, \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\" is a related case code. Also, in entry 38, it mentions \"USCA Case Number 25-1164 for 38 Notice of Appeal\". Wait, but USCA Case Number might be the appellate case number. The checklist asks for case code numbers, which are typically like \"1:25-cv-881\" for district court or \"25-1164\" for appellate.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 10 has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\", which is a district court case number. Entry 43 says \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\", which is the appellate case number. Entry 57 says \"USCA Case Number 25-1265\". So these are related cases.\n\nBut the checklist is about related cases listed by their case code numbers. So the values should be \"1:25-cv-881\", \"25-1164\", \"25-1265\". Wait, but need to confirm if these are actual case codes. The Docket mentions \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\" as a related case. The USCA numbers are also case numbers for related appeals.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so any case numbers mentioned as related. So from the Docket, we have \"1:25-cv-881\", \"25-1164\", \"25-1265\".\n\nWait, in entry 10, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\", so that's a district court case number. Entry 43: \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\", and entry 57: \"USCA Case Number 25-1265\". So these are the related case codes.\n\nBut the Docket document is fully visited, so we can extract these from there. The user's recent action was reading the Docket, so the text is already available. Now, the next step is to extract these values and append them to the checklist.\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\n- \"1:25-cv-881\" from entry 10, with evidence text \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5\"\n- \"25-1164\" from entry 43, evidence \"USCA Case Number 25-1164 for 38 Notice of Appeal\"\n- \"25-1265\" from entry 57, evidence \"USCA Case Number 25-1265 for 55 Notice of Appeal\"\n\nWait, entry 43: \"USCA Case Number 25-1164 for 38 Notice of Appeal, filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nEntry 57: \"USCA Case Number 25-1265 for 55 Notice of Appeal, filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, et al\"\n\nSo all these are case codes. Now, need to make sure they are distinct. 1:25-cv-881 is a district case, 25-1164 and 25-1265 are appellate cases. All are related cases mentioned in the document.\n\nSo the next action should be to append these to the checklist. The checklist key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nEach value needs evidence: verbatim text, source document (Docket), location (the specific entry number, like entry 10, 43, 57).\n\nSo the append_checklist action should have the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" with three extracted entries, each with evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions have already read the Docket, so the text is available. The current status shows that the Docket is fully visited, so we can extract from it.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to use append_checklist with the three case codes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"1:25-cv-881\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D.

The user wants me to extract all checklist items from the legal documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" which are case codes mentioned in the documents.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted three values from the Docket document: \"1:25-cv-881\", \"25-1164\", and \"25-1265\". The Docket document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but I need to check if they might contain more case codes.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting every distinct value. The user mentioned that the Docket has three values, but maybe other documents have more. For example, the \"Notice of Appeal\" (document 55) mentions \"USCA Case No. 25-1265\", which was already extracted as 25-1265. Wait, but they already have that from Docket Entry 57. So maybe other documents like the Complaint or Orders might have more case numbers.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was an append_checklist with three values. The current status shows all keys are filled (1 out of 1), but the system says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\". However, the user needs to make sure that all possible case numbers are extracted. The Docket was fully read, but maybe other documents have additional case codes.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Notice of Appeal\" [Pleading / Motion / Brief] is unvisited. Let me check if there's a case number there. The Docket Entry 38 mentions \"Notice of Appeal\" with USCA Case Number 25-1164, which was already extracted. But maybe the actual Notice of Appeal document has more case numbers. Wait, the Docket Entry 43 says \"USCA Case Number 25-1164 for 38 Notice of Appeal\", so the case number is already captured. Similarly, Entry 57 has 25-1265.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so any case numbers mentioned as related. The Docket entries already listed 1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, 25-1265. Are there other case numbers in the other documents?\n\nThe user's current step is to check if there are more values. Since the Docket is fully read, and the other documents are unvisited, maybe I should check another document. But the next step is to choose an action. The available actions are read_document, search_document_regex, etc.\n\nWait, the user's checklist has only one item: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number. They've extracted three values. The problem is whether there are more in other documents. The Docket is fully visited, so no more there. The other documents might have case numbers. For example, the \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" might mention related cases.\n\nBut the user needs to check. Since the Docket was fully read, the next logical step is to read another document that might contain case numbers. The most likely candidates would be documents like \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Order\" documents, as they often reference other cases.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"Notice of Appeal\" [Pleading / Motion / Brief] is 686 tokens, which is small. Maybe it's safe to read that. Alternatively, the \"Order\" documents might have references. But the user should pick one to read.\n\nWait, the system says that when you read a document, you should read a targeted window. Since the \"Notice of Appeal\" is unvisited, and it's a short document (686 tokens), it's a good candidate. But maybe there's a better way. The user could use search_document_regex to look for case numbers in all documents. But the regex might be too broad.\n\nThe case numbers follow patterns like \"1:25-cv-881\" (district court) or \"25-1164\" (appellate). So a regex pattern like `\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+` might catch them. But the user should use search_document_regex to find these in the unvisited documents.\n\nWait, the current step is to choose one action. The user has already extracted three values. The question is whether there are more. Since the Docket is fully visited, and other documents are unvisited, the next step should be to search or read another document.\n\nBut the system's decision policy says: if a specific document likely contains a target value, choose read_document or search_document_regex. The \"Notice of Appeal\" document might have the case number, but it's already been referenced in the Docket. However, the actual document might have more context.\n\nWait, the Docket Entry 38 says \"Notice of Appeal\" with USCA Case No. 25-1164, and Entry 43 confirms it. So the case number 25-1164 is already extracted. Similarly, 25-1265 from Entry 57. The 1:25-cv-881 from Entry 10.\n\nAre there any other case numbers in the Docket? Let's check the Docket text provided. Entry 10 mentions \"Vizguerra-Ramirez v. Choate, et. al, Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5\". Entry 43: \"USCA Case Number 25-1164 for 38 Notice of Appeal\". Entry 57: \"USCA Case Number 25-1265 for 55 Notice of Appeal\". So those three are all.\n\nOther entries in the Docket don't mention other case numbers. For example, Entry 26 has \"Respondents Dawn Ceja, ...\", but no case numbers. So maybe the Docket has all the case numbers.\n\nBut the user should confirm if other documents have more. The \"Notice of Appeal\" document (686 tokens) might have the case number again, but it's redundant. However, to be thorough, maybe check the \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" (9,444 tokens) as it might reference other cases.\n\nWait, the Motion for Class Certification (Entry 4) mentions \"MOTION to Certify Class by Petitioners D.B.U., R.M.M.. (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit Galindo Declaration)\". But the actual document might have case references. However, since the Docket already lists the related cases, maybe the other documents don't add new ones.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to extract EVERY distinct value found in any document. So if another document has a case number not in the Docket, it should be included. But the Docket is the main source for such references.\n\nGiven that the Docket is fully read, and the other documents are unvisited, but the most likely place for case numbers is the Docket (which is already processed), the next step might be to use get_checklist to verify if all values are captured.\n\nWait, the current status shows 3 values extracted, and the checklist key is filled. The system says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so maybe they're done. But the user needs to make sure no other documents have more case numbers.\n\nHowever, the available documents include the \"Notice of Appeal\" and others. To be safe, perhaps search all unvisited documents for case numbers using regex. So using search_document_regex with a pattern that matches case numbers.\n\nThe regex pattern could be something like r'Case No\\. (\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|[\\d-]+)' to capture the case numbers. But the exact pattern should be precise. The examples are \"1:25-cv-881\" and \"25-1164\", so the pattern could be r'Case No\\.? [^\\s]*\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+'\n\nWait, but the Docket already has those. The search might not find new ones. But the user should check to be thorough.\n\nThe decision policy says: use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since case numbers follow a pattern, search_document_regex is appropriate here.\n\nSo the next action should be to call search_document_regex with the pattern to find case numbers in all unvisited documents. The parameters would be doc_name='all' (since all unvisited documents are candidates), pattern matching the case numbers, and top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which is the case code number. So the regex should look for strings like \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\" or \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\".\n\nThe pattern could be something like r'(?:Case No\\.|USCA Case Number)\\s*([\\d:.-]+)'. But to capture the exact format, maybe r'(?:Case No\\.|USCA Case Number)\\s*(\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+)'\n\nBut to avoid missing, maybe a broader pattern. However, the user should use a precise pattern to avoid false positives.\n\nAlternatively, since the Docket already has the three values, and the other documents are less likely to have more, but to be thorough, do a search.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern matching the case numbers. Let's set pattern to r'Case No\\.? [^,]*?(\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+)'\n\nWait, but in the Docket Entry 10, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5\". So the case number is \"1:25-cv-881\". The pattern should capture that.\n\nSimilarly, \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\".\n\nSo the regex could be r'(?:Case No\\.|USCA Case Number)\\s*(\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+)'\n\nTesting that regex:\n\n- \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881\" → matches \"1:25-cv-881\"\n- \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\" → matches \"25-1164\"\n\nSo the pattern seems good.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call search_document_regex with that pattern, on all documents (doc_name='all'), top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nBut the system says to choose ONE action. So the correct next step is to use search_document_regex to check all unvisited documents for any additional case numbers.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"(?:Case No\\\\.|USCA Case Number)\\\\s*(\\\\d+:\\\\d+-\\\\w+-\\\\d+|\\\\d+-\\\\d+)\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "(?:Case No\\.|USCA Case Number)\\s*(\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+)", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11356, "completion_tokens": 2480, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and they've already found three values: \"1:25-cv-881\", \"25-1164\", and \"25-1265\".\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket document is fully visited (100% coverage), and the search_document_regex found 43 matches across multiple documents. However, the user has only extracted three values so far. The search results show more matches, especially in the \"Class Petition\" document (5 matches) and \"Notice of Appeal\" document (3 matches), but the user hasn't read those documents fully yet.\n\nThe key point here is that the search found additional matches in the \"Class Petition\" document (e.g., \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in multiple places). The current extracted values include \"1:25-cv-881\" but not \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\". Wait, let me check the search results again.\n\nIn the Class Petition document, the search matches show \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" appearing multiple times. But the existing extracted value is \"1:25-cv-881\" from the Docket entry. So \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" is a new value that hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nThe user's current extraction has three values, but the search results indicate there's another case number \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" that should be added. The search in the Class Petition document (which is partially visited) has multiple matches for this case number. The document has 10,707 tokens and only 8% coverage, so there's more text to read.\n\nThe next logical step is to read the Class Petition document to confirm the case number \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" and extract it as a new value. Since the document is partially visited, I should read the unvisited token ranges. The viewed tokens are 0-100, 257-457, 731-931, 1315-1515, 1762-1962. The next unvisited range would be from 1962 onwards, but to be efficient, I should read a larger unvisited segment (up to 10,000 tokens). The document has 10,707 tokens, so reading from 1962 to 10707 would cover the rest.\n\nWait, but the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens. The document's total is 10,707, so reading from 1962 to 10707 would be 8745 tokens, which is under 10,000. That's acceptable.\n\nThe user needs to extract all distinct values. The search already found \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in the Class Petition, so reading the document to confirm and extract it is necessary. The existing extracted values don't include this, so it's a new value.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the Class Petition document from token 1962 to the end (10707) to get the full context and confirm the case number.

The search in Step 4 found matches in various documents, including the Class Petition, Docket, etc. The recent `read_document` was on the Class Petition from tokens 1962-10707, but the previous search already found matches in that document. Wait, the search results mentioned 43 matches across documents, but the user read a part of the Class Petition. However, the values already extracted seem to cover the main case numbers.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about related cases identified by their case numbers. The three values found are all case numbers. The search pattern was looking for \"Case No.\" or \"USCA Case Number\" followed by a pattern like \"1:25-cv-881\" or \"25-1164\". The matches found in the Class Petition document (e.g., \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\") might have a different case number, but the user's extracted values are \"1:25-cv-881\" from Docket entry 10, and the USCA numbers from other entries.\n\nWait, the Class Petition document itself has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in the header. But the extracted values so far are \"1:25-cv-881\", which is a different number. So maybe \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" is the main case number, but the related cases are \"1:25-cv-881\" (a different case) and the USCA numbers. Wait, the Docket entry 10 mentions \"Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5\". So \"1:25-cv-881\" is a related case, not the main one. The main case here is \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\".\n\nSo the three extracted values are correct. Now, the user needs to check if there are more related cases. The search found 43 matches, but the user has already processed some. The Docket document was fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to re-read that. The Class Petition was partially visited (90% coverage), but the search already found matches there. The other documents like Order (001) have only 5% coverage, so maybe they have more case numbers.\n\nWait, the search results showed matches in Order (001) with 5 matches, but only 5% was read. The user read tokens 0-100 and 317-517 in Order (001), but maybe there are more case numbers in the remaining tokens. Similarly for other orders.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the task is to find all related cases. The three values found so far are from the Docket (1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, 25-1265). Are there more in other documents?\n\nLooking at the search results, the \"Class Petition\" had matches like \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in the header, but that's the main case, not a related one. The related cases would be other case numbers mentioned in the document, like \"1:25-cv-881\" from Docket entry 10. The search pattern was looking for \"Case No.\" followed by a pattern, so \"1:25-cv-881\" matches the pattern.\n\nThe other matches in the search were for \"USCA Case Number 25-1164\" and \"25-1265\", which were already extracted. The search in Step 4 found 43 matches, but the user has only extracted 3 values. Wait, the search in Step 4 found matches, but the values were already in the checklist. The user's Step 3 appended the three values, so maybe the search was redundant.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", so they have three. But the search found 43 matches. However, the user might have already extracted all unique related case numbers. Let me check the extracted values again.\n\nThe three values are:\n1. \"1:25-cv-881\" from Docket entry 10.\n2. \"25-1164\" from Docket entry 43.\n3. \"25-1265\" from Docket entry 57.\n\nThese are all distinct and seem to be the related cases. The search in the Class Petition document found \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" which is the main case, not a related one, so it shouldn't be included. The other matches in the search results (like in Order (001)) might be the same case numbers.\n\nThe user's next action should be to check if there are any other related cases. The available documents include several Orders and other pleadings. For example, Order (001) has a case number \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in the header, but that's the main case. The related cases are the ones mentioned as references, like \"1:25-cv-881\" in Docket entry 10.\n\nWait, Docket entry 10 says \"See also Vizguerra-Ramirez v. Choate, et. al, Case No. 1:25-cv-881, D. Colo., ECF No. 11 at 4-5\". So \"1:25-cv-881\" is a related case. The USCA case numbers are for the appeal, so they are related cases as well.\n\nAre there any other related cases mentioned in other documents? For example, in the Class Petition document, they mention other cases. Let's look at the text from the Class Petition. The user read tokens 1962-10707, but the relevant part might be in the earlier tokens. Wait, the search found matches in the Class Petition document at tokens 0-100, 257-457, etc. The first match was \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\", which is the main case. The other matches in the search might not be related case numbers.\n\nThe search pattern was \"(?:Case No\\.|USCA Case Number)\\s*(\\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+|\\d+-\\d+)\", so it's capturing case numbers like \"1:25-cv-881\" or \"25-1164\". The matches found in the Class Petition were for \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\", which matches the pattern (since it's \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" which fits the pattern as \\d+:\\d+-\\w+-\\d+). Wait, but the user's extracted value was \"1:25-cv-881\", which is different. So \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" is a different case number. But the checklist is about related cases, so maybe this is a related case? Wait, the main case is \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\", and the related case mentioned in Docket entry 10 is \"1:25-cv-881\". So \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" is the main case, not a related one. The related case is \"1:25-cv-881\".\n\nWait, the problem says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so it's cases related to the main case, not the main case itself. So the main case number (1:25-cv-01163-CNS) shouldn't be included, but references to other cases (like 1:25-cv-881) should be.\n\nThe user's extracted value \"1:25-cv-881\" is correct as a related case. The Class Petition's header has the main case number, which isn't a related case. So the three values are correct.\n\nNow, to check if there are more related cases. The search found 43 matches, but most of them are the same case numbers. For example, \"1:25-cv-881\" appears multiple times in the Docket, but it's the same case, so only one entry is needed. Similarly, \"25-1164\" and \"25-1265\" are unique.\n\nThe other documents like Order (001) might have references to other cases. Let's see. The user read tokens 0-100 and 317-517 in Order (001), which had \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" in the header. But that's the main case. The text in Order (001) might have other references.\n\nWait, the search results for Order (001) showed 5 matches, but the user only read the first few tokens. For example, the first match in Order (001) was tokens 0-100: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS...\". The next match might be elsewhere. If there's another case number mentioned, like \"1:25-cv-881\", that would be a new value. But the search pattern would have captured it.\n\nBut the user's current extracted values are three. The system says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", so maybe that's all. The next step would be to confirm if all possible related cases have been found.\n\nThe available documents that are partially visited (like Order (001), (002), etc.) might have more case numbers. But the search in Step 4 already scanned all documents and found 43 matches, which likely include all instances. The three values extracted are from the matches, so perhaps there are no more unique values.\n\nWait, the search results showed that in \"Class Petition\", there were 5 matches, but they were all for the main case number (1:25-cv-01163-CNS), which isn't a related case. The other matches in Docket and Notice of Appeal were for the related cases (1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, 25-1265).\n\nSo, the three values are all the unique related case numbers. Therefore, the checklist is complete.\n\nThe user should check if all keys are filled. The current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was a `read_document` on the Class Petition, but they already extracted the values. The checklist summary says all keys are filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and they have three values. The system says \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", and no empty keys. So they should stop.\n\nThe user's current step is Step 6, and they've extracted all values. So the next action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted with 3 distinct values: 1:25-cv-881 (from Docket Entry 10), 25-1164 (from Docket Entry 43), 25-1265 (from Docket Entry 57).

The user is asking me to extract the related cases from the legal documents, specifically the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". From the prior steps, they've already extracted three values: 1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, and 25-1265.\n\nLooking at the current status, all three values were extracted from the Docket document. The checklist shows that this key is fully filled with 3 values. The system's automatic review after the first stop (step 6) confirms that the checklist has 1 key filled with 3 values. The documents that were checked include the Docket (fully visited), and others partially visited.\n\nThe user's current step is step 7, which is an automatic get_checklist. The system is prompting for the next action. The available documents include several that are partially visited, but the checklist is already filled. The system says \"All checklist items fully extracted with 3 distinct values\" and \"Checklist Status: 1/1 filled\".\n\nWait, but the user has a note saying \"No additional related cases found in remaining documents after comprehensive search and reading.\" So, the three values are the only ones. The documents that are partially visited (like Class Petition, Order (001), etc.) have been searched via regex in step 4, which found matches, but those matches were already covered in the extracted values.\n\nThe key point is that the checklist is already complete. The three values are confirmed, and the system's automatic review says it's 1/1 filled. The next step should be to stop since all required items are extracted. The system even says \"Stop attempt 1/2\" but the instructions say to stop when all keys are filled. Since there's only one key and it's filled, stopping now is correct.\n\nI need to make sure there are no more documents to check that might have additional cases. The search_document_regex in step 4 found 43 matches across documents, but the extracted values from those matches were the three already listed. For example, the Class Petition document's matches had \"1:25-cv-01163-CNS\" which is the same case as the main one (1:25-cv-01163), but the checklist item is about related cases listed by their case numbers. The extracted values from Docket were 1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, 25-1265. The Class Petition's case number is 1:25-cv-01163, which is the main case, not a related one. So those aren't additional related cases.\n\nThe Docket entries mentioned 1:25-cv-881 (from Docket Entry 10), 25-1164 (from 43), and 25-1265 (from 57). The other matches in the regex search, like in the Class Petition, are the main case numbers, not related cases. So no new related cases were found in the other documents.\n\nTherefore, all related cases have been extracted. The checklist is complete. The next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted with 3 distinct values (1:25-cv-881, 25-1164, 25-1265) confirmed across documents.
