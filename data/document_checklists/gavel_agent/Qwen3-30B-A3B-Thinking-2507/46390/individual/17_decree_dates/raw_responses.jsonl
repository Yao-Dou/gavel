The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, which requires every distinct date related to decrees, including entry, modifications, stays, etc.\n\nFirst, I should check the available documents. The snapshot shows 13 documents, all unvisited (○ Unvisited). The task is to find decree dates, so I need to look for documents that likely contain orders or decrees. The document names include \"Order (001)\" through \"Order (005)\", which are probably the main sources. The \"Docket\" might also have dates, but the orders are more likely to have the specific decree dates.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I should start with the most relevant ones. The Orders (001 to 005) are the primary candidates. The first step is to read one of these documents. The largest Order is Order (001) with 19,585 tokens, but the maximum read is 10,000 tokens. So I'll read the first 10,000 tokens of Order (001) to check for dates.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the document catalog is known (13 documents found in Step 1), so list_documents isn't needed. The next action should be read_document. Which document? Order (001) seems the most comprehensive. Let me confirm the token count: 19,585 tokens. Reading from start_token 0 to 10,000 would cover the beginning. The evidence needs to be verbatim, so checking the start of the order might have the entry date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Docket\" has the decree dates listed, but the Orders are more likely to contain the actual decree details. So starting with Order (001) makes sense. The next step is to call read_document for Order (001) with start 0, end 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3654, "completion_tokens": 467, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all decree dates from legal documents, specifically the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item. The snapshot shows that this key is currently empty, and the recent actions have already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Order (001)\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if the text I've read contains any decree dates. The document provided is a court order dated April 22, 2025. Let me scan through the text for dates related to decrees or orders.\n\nLooking at the document:\n- The document is labeled as \"Document 35\" filed on \"04/22/25\" (April 22, 2025).\n- There's a mention of \"April 14, 2025\" in the procedural background (ECF No. 10).\n- The order was issued on April 22, 2025, after oral argument on April 21, 2025.\n- The order grants the TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) and sets forth the terms.\n\nThe key here is to identify dates that are decree-related. The order itself is a decree, so the filing date (04/22/25) and the date of the order (April 22, 2025) should be included. The procedural dates like April 14 and April 21 are related to the motion process but not the decree itself.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates\". So the entry date of the order (April 22, 2025) is a key date here.\n\nThe document says \"Document 35 filed 04/22/25\", which is the entry date. The order was signed on that date. So the decree date is April 22, 2025. The format should be \"[date]: [decree event]\". So \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\".\n\nI need to check if there are other dates in the text. The order mentions the April 14, 2025 order (ECF No. 10), but that's a previous order, not the current decree. The current decree is the one being read, so its entry date is the key.\n\nAlso, the document doesn't mention any modifications, stays, or terminations of this decree, so only the entry date should be extracted.\n\nNow, evidence must include:\n- text: the verbatim snippet showing the date\n- source_document: \"Order (001)\"\n- location: page number or token range. The document shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 35 filed 04/22/25 USDC Colorado pg 1 of 35\", so the date is in the header.\n\nSo the extracted value would be:\n- value: \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\"\n- evidence: text \"Document 35 filed 04/22/25\", source \"Order (001)\", location \"Page 1\"\n\nWait, the checklist requires the date format as \"[date]: [decree event]\". The example given in the requirements is \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\". So the value should be exactly that string.\n\nNow, since this is the first value found, and the checklist key is currently empty, I need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist key \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" is empty, so appending the new value makes sense.\n\nI shouldn't use update_checklist because it's the first entry, and append is for adding new entries. Also, the value isn't \"Not Applicable\" here.\n\nThe next action should be append_checklist with the extracted value and evidence. The document is \"Order (001)\", and the text is from the header on page 1.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist would have:\n- key: \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\"\n- extracted: [ { value: \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\", evidence: [ { text: \"Document 35 filed 04/22/25\", source_document: \"Order (001)\", location: \"Page 1\" } ] } ]\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of evidence objects, each with text, source_document, location. So in this case, one evidence entry.\n\nNow, check if the document has more decree dates. The text provided ends at page 18, but the document is 19,585 tokens, so there's more to read. However, the current action is to process the text just read. The recent action was reading tokens 0-10000, and the date is in the header (first page), so it's covered.\n\nNo other decree dates are visible in the provided text. The April 14 date is a prior order, not the decree in question. So only one date to extract.\n\nThus, the next action is to append this value to the checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 35     filed 04/22/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (001)\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Dates_of_All_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "04/22/25: Entry of Order", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 35     filed 04/22/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1", "source_document": "Order (001)", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14106, "completion_tokens": 1287, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract decree dates from legal documents, specifically the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item. From the recent actions, they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of Order (001) and found one date: \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\" from the document header.\n\nHmm, the current status shows they've extracted 1 value but there are 12 other documents unvisited. The key is that \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" should include all decree-related dates - entry dates, modifications, suspensions, etc. The current extraction only has the entry date from the first document.\n\nI need to check if Order (001) has more decree dates beyond the header. The read_document was only up to token 10,000, and the document has 19,585 tokens (51% covered). The header shows \"filed 04/22/25\" but the actual decree might have more dates in the body. \n\nWait, looking at the text they provided, the document is an Order dated April 22, 2025. The header says \"filed 04/22/25\" but the decree itself might have other dates. For example, the procedural background mentions April 12, 14, 17, 20, 21 dates, but those are filing dates or hearing dates - not decree dates. The checklist specifically says \"decree-related dates\" including entry dates, so the filed date (04/22/25) is valid as the entry date.\n\nBut I should verify if there are more decree dates in this document. The text shows the order was filed on 04/22/25, but does it mention any amendments or modifications? Scanning the excerpt, I don't see any other dates related to decree changes. The only decree date mentioned is the filing date.\n\nNow, about other documents: there's Order (002) through (005) which are likely to contain additional decree dates. For example, Order (002) might be a modified order with a new date. The document catalog shows they're all unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I should check those next.\n\nThe next logical step is to read more of Order (001) to see if there are additional decree dates in the remaining tokens (10,001-19,585). But the user's system says not to reread fully visited documents, and Order (001) is only partially visited (51% covered). So reading the next token range makes sense.\n\nWait, the policy says: \"When reading partially visited documents (marked with ◐ Partially Visited), read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" So I should read tokens 10000-20000 (since max 10,000 tokens per call) to cover the remaining 9,585 tokens.\n\nBut I should also consider if other documents might have decree dates. The checklist requires \"every distinct value,\" so I need to check all documents. However, the current document (Order (001)) is the first one read and might contain the most relevant dates. It's efficient to finish checking this document first before moving to others.\n\nLooking at the document names, \"Order (001)\" is clearly the main order, and subsequent orders (002, 003 etc.) might be amendments. So checking Order (001) completely first makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be read_document on Order (001) for tokens 10000-20000 (since 10000 is the next unviewed token, and 20000 is within the 19,585 token limit).\n\nI should not use search_document_regex yet because the dates are likely in the document body, not a patterned header. The current extraction already found the date from the header, but there might be more in the body.\n\nAlso, the user has a \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" key with one value, and they need to confirm if that's the only one or if there are more. So reading the rest of Order (001) is the most direct next step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14242, "completion_tokens": 979, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Order (002) is filed on 05/06/25, so that should be extracted as \"05/06/25: Entry of Order\". The previous entry from Order (001) was 04/22/25. So Order (002) has a new date.\n\nThe user's last action was reading Order (002) tokens 0-10000. The text shows \"filed 05/06/25\" on the first page. So the date 05/06/25 is present in the unviewed part? Wait, no—the document says \"filed 05/06/25\" right at the top, so it's in the first part they read. Since they read tokens 0-10000 and the date is on page 1, it's already covered. So the date 05/06/25 should be extracted from Order (002).\n\nBut the current status shows only one value extracted.

The two dates they have are the filing dates of the orders, which are the entry dates of the orders. So those are valid.\n\nBut the system shows that all keys are filled (1/1), empty keys 0, Not Applicable 0. Total values extracted: 2. The documents listed as unvisited include things like Class Petition, Docket, Order (003), etc. But Order (003) is an Order/Opinion, so it might have another decree date.\n\nWait, the user's current action history shows that they've read Order (001) and Order (002) fully. The next step is to check if there are more documents that might contain decree dates. The available documents include Order (003), which is another Order/Opinion, so it's possible it has another decree date.\n\nBut the system says \"Current Status\" shows all keys are filled. But maybe there's another decree date in Order (003) or other documents. Wait, the checklist requires \"EVERY distinct value\" found in any document. So if Order (003) has another entry date, that needs to be extracted.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the one checklist key has two values. But the system might not have checked all documents yet. The user hasn't read Order (003) or others. So the next step should be to read another document that might have a decree date.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (003) is the next logical one to check. It's an Order/Opinion, so likely to have a decree date. The token count is 12,598, which is under 10k, so reading the whole document is possible. But the system says \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\", but Order (003) is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so it's safe to read.\n\nWait, the user's prior actions have read Order (001) and (002) fully. Now, Order (003) is unvisited, so they should read it to check for any decree dates. The next action should be `read_document` on Order (003) from tokens 0-10000 (since it's 12k tokens, but max 10k per read).\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can use `search_document_regex` to look for dates, but the problem is the dates are in the document headers. For example, in Order (001) and (002), the dates were in the \"filed\" field. So a regex like \"filed (\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\" might work, but the system says to use `read_document` to read the document first, then check for the dates.\n\nBut the current step is to choose the next action. The user has two values already, but there might be more. Since Order (003) is an Order/Opinion, it's likely to have a decree date. So the next action should be to read Order (003) tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, the system's decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document (default) or search_document_regex.\"\n\nSince Order (003) is an Order, it's likely to have a date in the header, so `read_document` is the right choice here.\n\nSo the next action is `read_document` for Order (003) tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 10000\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 28208, "completion_tokens": 1045, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 9, "run_id": "495ed169-2499-4975-a06d-9d77eafd9bba", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T09:03:15.365451-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The task is to extract all decree dates from legal documents, specifically for the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\". The user has provided a detailed snapshot of the current state of the extraction process.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's already been done. From the recent actions:\n- Step 1: list_documents found 13 documents.\n- Steps 2-3: read_document on Order (001) tokens 0-10000, then appended 1 value for Dates_of_All_Decrees.\n- Step 4: read_document on Order (001) tokens 10000-20000 (but the text shows it's actually Order (001) tokens 10000-19585).\n- Step 5: read_document on Order (002) tokens 0-10000.\n- Step 6: appended another value for Dates_of_All_Decrees (05/06/25: Entry of Order from Order (002) pg 1).\n- Step 7: read_document on Order (002) tokens 10000-13539 (which is the rest of Order (002)).\n- Step 8: read_document on Order (003) tokens 0-10000.\n\nNow, looking at the current status:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1 (Dates_of_All_Decrees)\n- Total Values Extracted: 2 (from Order (001) and Order (002))\n- Documents: Order (001) and Order (002) are fully visited, Order (003) is partially visited (79% covered).\n\nI need to check if there are more decree dates in the remaining documents. The next logical step is to read more of Order (003) since it's partially visited. The current view is tokens 0-10000, and the document has 12,598 tokens, so there's 2,598 tokens left (10000-12598).\n\nBut wait, the checklist requires extracting all distinct decree dates. The previous entries were:\n1. From Order (001): \"04/22/25: Entry of Order\" (from the document header: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 35     filed 04/22/25     USDC Colorado     pg 19\")\n2. From Order (002): \"05/06/25: Entry of Order\" (from \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 52     filed 05/06/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\")\n\nNow, looking at the text from Order (003) that was read (tokens 0-10000), I need to check if there's another decree date. The document header shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 51     filed 05/06/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\". Wait, that's the same date as Order (002). But Order (003) is a different document (Document 51 vs Document 52), but the filed date is the same. However, the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" should capture the entry date of the decree, so if Order (003) is another decree, it might have a different date, but the header says filed 05/06/25.\n\nWait, but in the previous steps, Order (002) was filed 05/06/25, and Order (003) is also filed 05/06/25? Let me check the text provided.\n\nIn Step 8, the read_document for Order (003) shows:\n\"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 51     filed 05/06/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\"\n\nSo both Order (002) (Document 52) and Order (003) (Document 51) are filed on 05/06/25. But Order (002) was the preliminary injunction, and Order (003) is the class certification order. However, the date is the same. So it's the same date, so it wouldn't be a new distinct value. But I need to confirm if there's another date in the text.\n\nLooking at the text of Order (003), the header says filed 05/06/25, and the document is dated 05/06/25. So the decree date is the same as Order (002). Therefore, it's not a new distinct value. So appending it again would be redundant.\n\nBut the checklist says \"every distinct value\", so duplicates shouldn't be added. So the existing two values (04/22/25 and 05/06/25) are already captured.\n\nNow, checking the other documents. The user's current status shows that Order (003) is partially visited (79% covered), but the remaining tokens (10000-12598) might contain other dates. However, the main decree dates are usually in the header, which was already read (filed 05/06/25). The rest of the document is the content, which may not have additional decree dates. But I should check to be thorough.\n\nThe next step should be to read the remaining tokens of Order (003) to ensure there are no other decree dates. Since Order (003) has 12,598 tokens and 10,000 have been read, the remaining is 2,598 tokens (10000-12598). So the next action should be to read_document on Order (003) with start_token 10000 and end_token 12598.\n\nBut wait, the user's previous step (Step 8) was reading Order (003) tokens 0-10000. Now, to cover the rest, the next read should be tokens 10000-12598.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" only needs the entry dates of the orders, which are already captured in the headers. So there's no need to read further, but to be safe, I should check the remaining tokens to confirm.\n\nHowever, the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"When reading partially visited documents, read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\"\n\nSince Order (003) is partially visited (viewed 0-10000), the next read should be the unviewed part (10000-12598).\n\nBut looking at the text provided in Step 8 (Order (003) tokens 0-10000), the content is about the class certification order, and the header already shows the date. The body of the document doesn't seem to have another decree date. But to be thorough, I should read the remaining tokens.\n\nHowever, the user's current status shows that all keys are already filled (1 key with 2 values), but the system requires checking if there are more. Wait, the status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", so it's possible that's all. But the checklist might have more dates in other documents.\n\nWait, the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" includes entry dates of decrees. The two orders found so far have dates 04/22/25 and 05/06/25. Are there any other orders? The documents list Order (004), Order (005), etc., which might have their own dates.\n\nFor example, Order (004) is 818 tokens, Order (005) is 346 tokens. These could have decree dates. But since they're unvisited, I need to read them.\n\nBut the decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document\".\n\nSo, the next action could be to read Order (003) to finish its coverage, then check other documents. But since the header of Order (003) already shows 05/06/25, which is the same as Order (002), it's redundant. So maybe no new value.\n\nBut to be safe, I should read the remaining tokens of Order (003) to confirm. If no new dates, then move to other documents.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" might also include modification dates, suspension dates, etc., but in the provided text, only the entry dates are visible.\n\nLooking at the Order (001) text, the date is 04/22/25 (from the header). Order (002) is 05/06/25. Order (003) is also 05/06/25. So Order (003) is a different document but same date.\n\nNow, checking Order (004) and (005) are very short. Order (004) is 818 tokens, Order (005) is 346. They might have dates in their headers.\n\nFor example, Order (004) might have a filed date like \"filed 05/10/25\" or something. So it's possible there's another date.\n\nBut the user's current action should be to read the next document that's unvisited, but the policy says to read a targeted window in a document likely to contain the value.\n\nSince Order (003) is partially visited, and the remaining tokens might not have new dates (as the header already captured the date), it's better to finish Order (003) first to confirm, then move to other documents.\n\nWait, but the status says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", and the two values are from Order (001) and Order (002). Order (003) is another document, but same date. So no new value.\n\nHowever, the checklist requires \"every distinct value\", so if Order (003) has the same date, it's not distinct. So it's not added.\n\nNow, the next logical step is to check if there are other documents with different dates. The next document to read could be Order (004), which is unvisited.\n\nBut the current state shows Order (003) is partially visited, so the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of Order (003) before moving on. Because if there's a date in the body, it might be a different event (like a modification date), but in this case, the decree date is the entry date.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event].'\", and the decree event for the order is \"Entry of Order\" as per the previous entries.\n\nSo for Order (003), the decree event would also be \"Entry of Order\", but the date is the same as Order (002), so it's not a new distinct value.\n\nTherefore, the remaining tokens of Order (003) probably don't have new dates. But to be thorough, the next action should be to read the unviewed tokens of Order (003) to confirm.\n\nSo the action would be read_document on Order (003) with start_token 10000 and end_token 12598.\n\nAfter that, if no new dates are found, the next step would be to check other documents like Order (004), etc.\n\nBut the user's current status shows that the checklist has two values, and the system might be done. However, the instructions say to stop only when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with two values, but are there more?\n\nWait, the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" might include other events. For example, in Order (001), the date is 04/22/25, which is the TRO entry. In Order (002), 05/06/25 is the preliminary injunction. Order (003) is the class certification order, filed on the same date.\n\nBut the checklist says \"entry dates, modification/amendment dates, suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates\". So if any of these are present, they need to be extracted.\n\nIn Order (001), the date 04/22/25 is the entry of the TRO (temporary restraining order), which is a decree. In Order (002), 05/06/25 is the entry of the preliminary injunction. Order (003) is the class certification order, entry date same as Order (002).\n\nBut Order (003) might have a different decree event. However, the date is the same, so it's not a new date.\n\nNow, looking at the provided text for Order (003), the header shows \"filed 05/06/25\", so the decree date is 05/06/25, same as Order (002). So no new distinct date.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of Order (003) to confirm no other dates, then proceed to other documents.\n\nBut since the document is partially visited, the next read should be the remaining tokens (10000-12598).\n\nSo the correct action is read_document for Order (003) with start_token 10000 and end_token 12598.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\",\n    \"start_token\": 10000,\n    \"end_token\": 12598\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12598}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 38564, "completion_tokens": 3116, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all decree dates from the legal documents, following very specific guidelines. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and so far we've extracted two values: one from Order (001) and one from Order (002). The evidence for the second value was \"05/06/25: Entry of Order\" from Order (002) page 1.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (001), (002), and (003) are all fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), meaning we've read all their tokens. The remaining documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), like the Class Petition, Docket, Order (004), etc.\n\nThe key instruction here is: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents.\" Since Orders (001-003) are already fully read, I shouldn't go back to them. I need to check the unvisited documents for any additional decree dates.\n\nNow, what constitutes a \"decree date\"? The checklist definition says: \"The decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates, suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates, for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions.\"\n\nI should look for dates in the unvisited documents that match these criteria. The most likely places would be in orders (like Order (004), Order (005)), docket entries, or motions that might reference court orders.\n\nLet me scan the unvisited documents:\n- Order (004): 818 tokens - this is an order, so likely contains a date\n- Order (005): 346 tokens - another order, probably with a date\n- Docket: 7370 tokens - might have date entries\n- Other documents like motions might reference dates but aren't orders themselves\n\nThe safest bet is to start with Order (004) since it's a short document (818 tokens) and likely contains a decree date. The \"read_document\" function is appropriate here since we're targeting a specific document for a known date pattern.\n\nI should read the entire Order (004) since it's small (under 10k tokens). The parameters would be doc_name: \"Order (004)\", start_token: 0, end_token: 818.\n\nNo need for regex search here because we're looking for a specific document that's likely to contain the decree date. The checklist definition is clear about what to extract, and orders typically have clear date information in the header.\n\nI won't use `get_checklist` yet because we haven't found new values to append. And we definitely can't stop since we haven't checked all documents.\n\nSo the next logical action is to read Order (004) in its entirety.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (004)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 818}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (004)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 818}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 31350, "completion_tokens": 671, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract all decree dates from legal documents, specifically focusing on the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item.\n\nLooking at the current status: there are two values already extracted (from Order 001 and Order 002), but the documents listed as \"unvisited\" include several that might contain more decree dates. The available documents show that Order (003) and Order (004) are fully visited, but there are many unvisited documents like the Class Petition, Docket, Order (005), and various motions.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The current extraction has two values, but maybe more exist in the unvisited documents. The checklist definition says to include entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc. for decrees.\n\nLooking at the unvisited documents:\n- Class Petition: might have dates related to the petition filing\n- Docket: likely contains court dates and order dates\n- Order (005): a new order, could have a decree date\n- Various motions: might reference when orders were entered\n\nThe key is to find where decree dates are mentioned. Since the existing values are from Order (001) and Order (002), the next logical step is to check the unvisited documents that might contain more decree-related dates.\n\nThe Docket document is particularly important because dockets typically list all court actions with dates. The \"Docket\" [Docket] is listed as unvisited with 7,370 tokens, which is under 10k, so it's safe to read. Reading the Docket would likely reveal more decree dates, such as when orders were filed or entered.\n\nAlso, Order (005) is a short 346-token document, which might have a decree date. But since the Docket is more comprehensive for tracking dates, it's a better starting point.\n\nThe previous actions have already read Order (001-004) fully. Now, the next step should be to read the Docket document to see if it contains additional decree dates. The Docket is a standard place where court dates, order entries, and other procedural dates are recorded.\n\nSo, the next action should be `read_document` on the Docket (tokens 0-7370, since it's 7370 tokens total and unvisited). That will provide context to check for any decree dates not yet captured.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7370}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7370}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21869, "completion_tokens": 565, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
