The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the filing date extracted from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and it's currently empty. There are 13 documents, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the filing date might be. In legal documents, the filing date is often on the complaint or the docket. The Complaint is listed as the first document, so that's a good starting point. The Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is more likely to have the initial filing date.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I need to pick one to read. The Complaint is 10,707 tokens, which is under the 10k max for a read_document call? Wait, no, the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens. The Complaint is 10,707, so reading the whole thing would exceed the limit. But the policy says to read a targeted window up to 10k tokens. So maybe read the first 10k tokens of the Complaint.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows the Complaint as 10,707 tokens. So the first 10,000 tokens would be start_token 0 to 10000. That's within the limit. I should call read_document on the Complaint with start 0 and end 10000. That way, I can check the beginning of the document where the filing date is usually found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the docket has the filing date. But the Complaint is the primary document where the filing date would be stated. The docket might list it, but the Complaint itself is more direct. So starting with the Complaint makes sense.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the user specified to extract the filing date, which is a specific date. A regex like r'Filed: ([\\d/]+)' might work, but since the user wants to read the document first, maybe better to read the Complaint and look for it. But the instructions say to use search_document_regex if it's patternable. However, since the document is unvisited, and the filing date is likely in the header or beginning, reading the document directly might be more efficient than searching.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document — default choice.\" So since the Complaint is the most likely document for the filing date, I should read it. The docket might also have it, but the Complaint is the first step.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint, starting at 0, ending at 10000 tokens. That's the safest first step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3538, "completion_tokens": 626, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of the \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" document. In that text, I need to find the filing date.\n\nLooking at the provided document excerpt, there's a line that says \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 1     filed 04/12/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\". So the filing date here is 04/12/25. That's April 12, 2025. The format is MM/DD/YY, so 04/12/25 would be April 12, 2025.\n\nThe checklist item is Filing_Date, and the requirement is to extract every distinct value. Since this is the first document read, and the date is clearly stated in the header, this should be the value to extract. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe location mentioned is \"pg 1\" for the document, but since it's a token range, the location in the document would be the first page. The document name is \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the text snippet is \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 1     filed 04/12/25     USDC Colorado     pg 1\".\n\nSo, the extracted value is \"04/12/25\" with the evidence as the text snippet. The next step is to use append_checklist to add this entry. The document is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but since the date is found in the first page, which is within the read tokens, no further reading is needed for this value. The checklist key Filing_Date is currently empty, so appending this entry will fill it. The user hasn't found any other values yet, so this is the only entry needed for now.

The Class Petition was partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the document has 10,707 tokens. The next step would be to check if there's another filing date in other documents. However, the Filing_Date is typically the date the initial complaint was filed, which is usually in the first document (the complaint). The other documents like Orders, Motions, etc., might have their own filing dates, but the checklist item specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing date is the one in the complaint.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So it's the date the case was started, which should be in the complaint (Document 1). The evidence they found is from the header of Document 1: \"filed 04/12/25\". So that's the correct date.
