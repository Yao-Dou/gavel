The current state clearly states \"No documents discovered yet,\" so the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding further.

The user needs to extract court rulings from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Court_Rulings\", and it's currently empty. There are 13 documents listed, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where to look for court rulings. The Order documents (Order 001 to 005) are probably where the court's decisions are written. The complaint and motions might reference rulings but the actual rulings would be in the orders.\n\nThe user mentioned that Court_Rulings should include things like granted/denied motions, injunctions, etc. So the Order documents are the best candidates. The first Order is Order (001) with 19,585 tokens. Since it's the largest, it's likely to contain the main rulings. But I need to read a part of it. The document is unvisited, so I should read a portion of it.\n\nWait, the system says not to read more than 10,000 tokens at a time. Order (001) is 19,585 tokens, so I'll read the first 10,000 tokens. That's the start of the document, which probably contains the main rulings. Using read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 makes sense.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex unless there's a specific pattern. Since the task is to find court rulings, which are in the orders, reading the first part of Order (001) is the most direct approach. The other orders are smaller, but Order (001) is the most likely to have the key rulings. So the next step is to read_document for Order (001) from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3677, "completion_tokens": 418, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract court rulings from legal documents, specifically the \"Court_Rulings\" checklist item. The snapshot shows that I've already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Order (001)\" and found some relevant text.\n\nLooking at the document excerpt, I need to find any court decisions or orders mentioned. The key part here is where the court states it's granting the emergency motion. On page 2, it says: \"After considering the parties’ written submissions, and having heard oral argument on April 21, 2025, the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\"\n\nThat's a clear ruling. The court granted the TRO motion. I should extract this as a separate value. The value should be a self-contained narrative: \"The court granted Petitioners' Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order on April 21, 2025, prohibiting the transfer of Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class outside the District of Colorado and requiring 21-day notice for removal under the Alien Enemies Act.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if there are other rulings in the text. Scanning further, on page 3, there's a mention of the Supreme Court's order in J.G.G. v. Trump, but that's not a ruling by this court. The main ruling here is the grant of the TRO. The court also discusses the legal standard and analysis, but the actual ruling is the granting of the TRO.\n\nI should make sure this is the only ruling in the read portion. The document continues with background and analysis, but the ruling itself is stated upfront. So, one value for Court_Rulings.\n\nFor evidence, I need to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The relevant text is \"the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\" The source is \"Order (001)\", and the location is page 2 (or tokens 0-10000, but since it's page 2, I'll note that).\n\nWait, the document shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS     Document 35     filed 04/22/25     USDC Colorado     pg 2 of 35\" so the text is on page 2. The evidence location should be \"page 2\" or \"pg 2\".\n\nSo, the extracted value should be: \"The court granted Petitioners' Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order on April 21, 2025, prohibiting the transfer of Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class outside the District of Colorado and requiring 21-day notice for removal under the Alien Enemies Act.\"\n\nEvidence: \n- text: \"the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\"\n- source_document: \"Order (001)\"\n- location: \"page 2\"\n\nI need to use append_checklist to add this new entry. The checklist key is \"Court_Rulings\", and the extracted list should have this new value. Since it's the first entry, I'll append it.\n\nCheck the tools: append_checklist allows adding to existing lists. The parameters need a patch array with key and extracted entries. Each extracted entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo, the JSON should have patch with key \"Court_Rulings\" and extracted array containing one entry with value as the narrative and evidence with text, source, location.\n\nI must ensure the value is self-contained. The example given in the requirements says to state what motion, how ruled, who, and date. Here, motion is Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, ruled granted, date April 21, 2025, and the order details.\n\nYes, this fits. No other rulings in the read text.

The user is a document extraction specialist tasked with pulling all court rulings from legal documents. The current snapshot shows they've already extracted one ruling from \"Order (001)\" and appended it successfully. Now they need to decide the next action.\n\nFirst, I'll check the document catalog status. The recent actions show they've already called `list_documents` (Step 1), so the catalog is known. The current status lists 13 documents, with \"Order (001)\" partially visited (tokens 0-10000 out of 19,585). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nThe checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" has one value extracted, but the user needs to check if more exist. The next logical step is to examine other documents that might contain additional rulings. Looking at the document list, \"Order (002)\" through \"Order (005)\" are all order/opinion documents that likely contain rulings. \"Order (001)\" was partially read, but the next step should be to read another document since \"Order (001)\" has unviewed tokens (10000-19585), but the policy says not to reread unviewed ranges without a specific reason. However, the current token range (0-10000) was read in Step 2, and the evidence found was on page 2, which is within that range. The remaining tokens in Order (001) might not contain additional rulings since the ruling was already found.\n\nWait, the document \"Order (001)\" has 19,585 tokens total, and they read up to 10,000 tokens. The ruling was found on page 2 (which is within the first 10,000 tokens, as the sample shows pages 1-18). The remaining tokens (10,000-19,585) might contain more, but the current evidence shows the ruling was already extracted. However, the policy says to avoid rereading unviewed ranges unless necessary. Since they've already found the ruling in the first part, maybe the other orders are more promising for additional rulings.\n\nLooking at the document types: \"Order (002)\", \"Order (003)\", \"Order (004)\", \"Order (005)\" are all Order/Opinion documents, which are likely to contain court rulings. The other documents like Complaints, Motions, Docket might not have rulings but rather submissions. The Docket might have a summary, but the primary rulings are in the Orders.\n\nThe user should prioritize reading another Order document. The next one to check is \"Order (002)\" since it's the next in sequence and unvisited. The token count is 13,539, so reading the first 10,000 tokens (0-10000) would be safe and within the limit.\n\nThe decision is to call `read_document` on \"Order (002)\" from tokens 0-10000. This follows the policy of reading targeted windows in unvisited documents to find more rulings. There's no regex pattern specified for a quick search, so the default `read_document` is appropriate here.\n\nNo need to use `get_checklist` yet because they haven't found new values. The current status shows one value extracted, but they need to check other documents for more. The next action must be to read another document to gather more evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (002)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14280, "completion_tokens": 796, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is a legal document extraction specialist working on a checklist for court rulings. The current task is to extract all distinct court rulings from legal documents, with each ruling needing its own entry and proper evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one ruling from Order (001) - the TRO grant on April 21, 2025. The checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" has 1 value out of 1 total needed. But the system shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning they think they're done? Wait no, the checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\" - so there might be more rulings to find.\n\nThe document catalog shows 13 documents, but only two have been partially read (Order 001 and 002). The most recent action was reading Order (002) tokens 0-10000. Let me check what's in that document.\n\nIn Order (002), I see the court granted Petitioners' preliminary injunction motion. The key part says: \"the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ preliminary injunction motion.\" And it references the earlier TRO order. This is a new ruling - a preliminary injunction, not just the TRO they already extracted.\n\nSo this is a second distinct ruling. The evidence should be from Order (002), page 2: \"the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ preliminary injunction motion.\"\n\nI need to append this to Court_Rulings. The evidence must include:\n- Verbatim text: \"the Court GRANTS Petitioners’ preliminary injunction motion.\"\n- Source document: Order (002)\n- Location: page 2 (or token range, but since they're using page numbers in the document, \"page 2\" is acceptable)\n\nThe system shows Order (002) is partially visited (74% coverage), but they've already read tokens 0-10000 which covers the relevant part on page 2. So no need to read more - the evidence is already in the text they've read.\n\nNo other documents need to be read yet since they've found a new ruling in the document they just read. They shouldn't use get_checklist because they have new values to append immediately.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with this new ruling entry.

The user is asking me to extract court rulings from legal documents, and I've already done some work on this. Looking at the current state, I've extracted two court rulings so far:\n\n1. From Order (001) on April 22, 2025: Granted Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)\n2. From Order (002) on May 6, 2025: Granted Preliminary Injunction\n\nThe checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" now has two values, both with evidence. The system shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning all checklist items are covered. But wait, the user's task says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\" - so I need to make sure there aren't more rulings in other documents.\n\nChecking the available documents:\n- Order (001) is partially visited (51% covered)\n- Order (002) is partially visited (74% covered)\n- Other documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited)\n\nI should check if there are more rulings in the unvisited documents. The \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" (51,897 tokens) might contain rulings from the Tenth Circuit. In Step 4, when reading Order (002), it mentions \"the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\"\n\nThat's a court ruling! The Tenth Circuit denied the stay. So I need to extract that as a separate ruling.\n\nThe document \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" is unvisited, but the evidence is already mentioned in Order (002). However, I should verify it's in the document. Since the system says \"the Tenth Circuit denied...\" in Order (002), I can use that as evidence, but I need to confirm the exact ruling.\n\nWait, the current Step 5 shows I appended the preliminary injunction ruling from Order (002). But Order (002) also mentions the Tenth Circuit's denial of the stay. Let me look at the text again:\n\n\"the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden. See D.B.U. v. Trump, No. 25-1164, 2025 WL 1233583, at *1 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, 2025).\"\n\nSo this is a separate ruling by the Tenth Circuit. I need to extract this as a third court ruling.\n\nBut the evidence is in Order (002), which I've already read partially. Since I've read Order (002) up to token 10000, and this part is on page 2 (which was covered), I should be able to extract it now.\n\nSo the new ruling would be:\n- \"The Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on April 29, 2025, because Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\"\n\nEvidence: From Order (002), page 2, \"the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\"\n\nI should append this to the Court_Rulings.\n\nBut wait, the system says I need to use \"append_checklist\" for adding new entries. Since this is a new value, I should append it.\n\nThe checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" already has two values, and this is a third. So I need to append this new value.\n\nLet me structure the evidence correctly:\n- value: \"The Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on April 29, 2025, because Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\"\n- evidence: \n  - text: \"the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\"\n  - source_document: \"Order (002)\"\n  - location: \"page 2\"\n\nI should check if the document has this exact text. In the provided Order (002) text, it's there on page 2.\n\nSo the next action should be to append this new value to Court_Rulings.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other rulings. But since the current state shows only \"Court_Rulings\" as the checklist item, and I've found three values now (two from the district court, one from the circuit court), I should append the third one.\n\nThe system says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so I must include all. I've got two, need to add the third.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with this new value.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Court_Rulings\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"The Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on April 29, 2025, because Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.\", \"source_document\": \"Order (002)\", \"location\": \"page 2\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Court_Rulings", "extracted": [{"value": "The Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on April 29, 2025, because Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.", "evidence": [{"text": "the Tenth Circuit denied Respondents’ emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the Court’s temporary restraining order on the grounds that Respondents failed to meet their irreparable harm burden.", "source_document": "Order (002)", "location": "page 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24895, "completion_tokens": 1226, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is a legal document extraction specialist working on a checklist item called \"Court_Rulings\" for a federal case. The task is to extract every distinct court ruling from the documents.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- They've already extracted 3 values for Court_Rulings:\n  1. From Order (001) - TRO granted on April 21, 2025\n  2. From Order (002) - Preliminary injunction granted on May 6, 2025\n  3. From Order (002) - Tenth Circuit denied stay motion on April 29, 2025\n\nThe document catalog shows:\n- Order (001) is partially visited (51% covered)\n- Order (002) is partially visited (74% covered)\n- 11 other documents are completely unvisited\n\nThe checklist definition requires extracting \"EVERY distinct value\" of court rulings, with each as a self-contained narrative. The current extraction has 3 values, but I need to check if there are more rulings in unvisited documents.\n\nImportant considerations:\n1. The Tenth Circuit denial (value #3) is technically a ruling, but it's from an appellate court. The checklist says \"court's decisions or orders on key motions\" - this should count as it's a court ruling on a motion.\n\n2. The document catalog shows several unvisited documents that might contain additional rulings:\n   - Order (003) to (005) are orders/opinions that could contain rulings\n   - The \"Docket\" document might list rulings\n   - Various motions/briefs could reference rulings\n\n3. The user has already read the first 10k tokens of Order (001) and (002), but:\n   - Order (001) has 19,585 tokens (51% covered = 10k tokens)\n   - Order (002) has 13,539 tokens (74% covered = 10k tokens)\n   - Both have unviewed portions (Order (001): 9,585 tokens remaining; Order (002): 3,539 tokens remaining)\n\n4. The next logical step is to check if the unviewed portions of the partially visited documents contain more rulings. Since the current extraction has 3 values, but the checklist definition says \"EVERY distinct value\", I should check if the remaining tokens in Order (001) or (002) contain additional rulings.\n\n5. Looking at the Order (002) text provided in Step 4, it's a full order granting preliminary injunction, so it's unlikely to have more rulings in the remaining tokens. But the unviewed portion of Order (001) might have more.\n\n6. However, the most efficient next step is to read the remaining unviewed tokens of Order (001) since it's the most comprehensive document (19k tokens) and they've only read half of it. The Tenth Circuit ruling mentioned in Order (002) was already extracted, so the main value might be in Order (001)'s remaining text.\n\n7. I should not assume all rulings are extracted yet - the checklist requires \"EVERY distinct value\", so I must check all documents thoroughly.\n\n8. The document catalog shows \"Order (003)\" through \"Order (005)\" are unvisited - these might contain additional rulings too. But since the user has already found rulings in the first two orders, and the case seems to be progressing through the court system, it's more likely the main rulings are in the earlier orders.\n\n9. Given the systematic extraction process, the best next action is to read the unviewed tokens of Order (001) since it's the most comprehensive document and they've only read half of it. This could reveal more rulings that weren't in the first 10k tokens.\n\n10. The user should not jump to other documents yet because the current document has significant unviewed content. The extraction process requires checking all tokens in a document before moving on.\n\n11. The \"Order (001)\" has 19,585 tokens, and they've viewed 0-10000 (51%), so the unviewed portion is 10001-19585 (9585 tokens, which is under 10k). So I can read the next 10k tokens (but since 9585 < 10k, just read to end).\n\nTherefore, the next action should be read_document on Order (001) for tokens 10001-19585.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 19585}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 19585}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 25057, "completion_tokens": 1068, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all court rulings from legal documents based on a specific checklist. I've been through several steps already, and now I need to figure out the next action.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: there's one checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" with three values already extracted. The documents available show that Order (001) is fully visited (19,585 tokens), and Order (002) is partially visited (only 10,000 tokens read out of 13,539). The rest of the documents are unvisited.\n\nThe key point here is that Order (002) still has unvisited tokens (10,001-13,539). In Step 7, they read Order (001) from 10001-19585, but Order (002) is only partially read. The previous steps show they extracted two rulings from Order (002) (the preliminary injunction and the Tenth Circuit denial), but there might be more in the unvisited part of Order (002).\n\nWait, the snapshot shows they read Order (002) tokens 0-10000 in Step 4, then in Step 7 they read Order (001) again. Now, Order (002) still has 3,539 tokens unvisited (from 10001 to 13539). Since the document is only partially visited, I should read the remaining tokens of Order (002) to see if there are more court rulings to extract.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value. The current extraction has three values: \n1. TRO granted (from Order 001)\n2. Preliminary injunction granted (from Order 002)\n3. Tenth Circuit denied stay (from Order 002)\n\nBut Order (002) has more content beyond 10,000 tokens. The document shows it's a 13,539-token document, and they only read up to 10,000. The text snippet they provided in Step 7 for Order (002) actually goes up to page 35 (which is the full document), but the read was only up to 10,000 tokens. Wait, no—the Step 7 action was reading Order (001) again, not Order (002). So Order (002) still has unvisited tokens.\n\nThe current status says Order (002) is partially visited with 0-10000 viewed (74% coverage). So I need to read the remaining tokens of Order (002) to check for additional rulings. The next logical step is to call `read_document` on Order (002) for tokens 10001-13539.\n\nI shouldn't use `search_document_regex` because the task is to read the document to find all rulings, not search for a pattern. And since Order (002) is partially visited, I must read the unvisited part. There's no need to call `list_documents` because the catalog is known. `get_checklist` would just show current status, but we need to extract more from the document. `append_checklist` or `update_checklist` would come after reading, not before.\n\nSo the correct next action is to read the remaining tokens of Order (002).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (002)\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 13539}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 13539}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24670, "completion_tokens": 802, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting court rulings from legal documents, and we've already processed two documents (Order (001) and Order (002)).\n\nLooking at the status:\n- Only one checklist item: Court_Rulings\n- 3 values have been extracted (1 from Order (001), 2 from Order (002))\n- All documents are either fully visited or unvisited, but the catalog shows 13 documents total\n- The current status shows all keys are filled (1/1), empty keys 0/1, Not Applicable 0/1\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Court_Rulings\" has 3 values extracted, and there are no empty keys or Not Applicable items. The status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning all keys have values.\n\nNow, checking the documents:\n- Order (001) and Order (002) are both fully visited (✓ Fully Visited)\n- The other 11 documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited)\n\nBut the checklist has only one item, and we've already extracted 3 values for it. The requirement is to extract EVERY distinct value, so I need to confirm if there are more rulings to extract from the unvisited documents.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So I should check if there are more rulings in the unvisited documents.\n\nBut the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", and the \"Extraction Progress\" says \"Court_Rulings: 3 values (1 from Order (001), 2 from Order (002)\".\n\nWait, the user's step 8 was reading Order (002) tokens 10001-13539, and they've already extracted 3 values. The next logical step would be to check if there are more rulings in the remaining documents.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present in the corpus for that key have been extracted, each with evidence. Not Applicable: represented as a single extracted entry with value 'Not Applicable'.\"\n\nSince we have a single key with 3 values already extracted, and the status shows all keys are filled, I should verify if there are more values to extract.\n\nHowever, the extraction process requires systematic reading. Since we've read two documents and extracted 3 values, but there are 11 unvisited documents, I should check if any of them contain additional court rulings.\n\nBut looking at the document types, the unvisited documents include:\n- Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus...\n- Docket\n- Order (003) to (005)\n- Various motions and briefs\n\nThe \"Court_Rulings\" item specifically refers to \"court's decisions or orders on key motions or issues\", so I need to check if any of these unvisited documents contain such rulings.\n\nThe next step should be to read one of the unvisited documents to see if it contains additional rulings. But which one?\n\nThe most likely candidates would be other Orders (like Order (003), (004), (005)) or the Docket, but Docket is usually a list of filings rather than rulings.\n\nSince we've already read Order (001) and Order (002), the next logical step is to read Order (003) to see if it contains additional rulings.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" - Order (001) and (002) are fully visited, so we shouldn't read them again.\n\nThe other orders (003, 004, 005) are unvisited, so I should read one of them.\n\nLooking at the token counts:\n- Order (003): 12,598 tokens (within the 10,000 token limit for a read_document call)\n- Order (004): 818 tokens (small, but still unvisited)\n- Order (005): 346 tokens (very small)\n\nSince Order (003) is the largest unvisited order document, it's likely to contain more rulings. So I should read Order (003) from tokens 0-10000 first.\n\nWait, but the instructions say: \"When reading partially visited documents (marked with ◐ Partially Visited), read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" But all unvisited documents are marked with ○ Unvisited, meaning no tokens have been viewed.\n\nSo for Order (003), I should read tokens 0-10000 (the first 10,000 tokens) since it's unvisited.\n\nBut let me double-check the current state. The user has already extracted 3 values from Order (001) and Order (002), and there's no indication that the remaining documents contain additional rulings. However, to be thorough, we should check the unvisited documents.\n\nSince the checklist item has a value count of 3, and we need to extract EVERY distinct value, I must check all documents. The next action should be to read Order (003) to see if it contains more rulings.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on Order (003) for tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, but let's check the token count of Order (003): 12,598 tokens. So reading 0-10000 is within the 10,000 token limit.\n\nAlternatively, I could use `search_document_regex` to look for patterns like \"granted\", \"denied\", \"injunction\", etc., but the instructions say to use `read_document` as the default choice for targeted reading.\n\nGiven that, `read_document` is the appropriate action here.\n\nSo the next action should be to read Order (003) from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 28288, "completion_tokens": 1332, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract court rulings from legal documents based on a specific checklist. The current status shows that Court_Rulings has 3 values already extracted from Order (001) and Order (002). The documents available include Order (003) which is partially visited (79% coverage), and several other unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are more court rulings in the remaining unvisited parts of Order (003). The current view for Order (003) is tokens 0-10000, but it's 12,598 tokens total, so there's 2,598 tokens left (10001-12598) that haven't been read yet. Since the checklist item is Court_Rulings, I should read the remaining tokens of Order (003) to see if there are additional rulings mentioned.\n\nLooking at the provided text for Order (003), it's a class certification order. The key part I need to check is whether there are any new court rulings beyond what's already extracted. The existing extracted values are:\n1. From Order (001): The court granted the motion for preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025.\n2. From Order (002): The Tenth Circuit denied a stay on April 29, 2025.\n3. Another from Order (002): The court granted the preliminary injunction.\n\nWait, actually, the prior steps show that Step 5 appended one value from Order (002), Step 6 appended another from Order (002), and Step 7 read Order (001) tokens 10001-19585. But the current status says 3 values total. The Order (003) document has a class certification order, which is a ruling. The document shows the court GRANTED the class certification motion. That's a new ruling that hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nThe text in Order (003) says: \"The Court GRANTS Petitioners’ class certification motion, certifying the class Petitioners seek to represent.\" This is a clear court ruling that should be added to the checklist.\n\nSince Order (003) is partially visited (only 0-10000 tokens read), and the relevant ruling is in the text that's already been provided (from the initial snapshot), I need to check if the ruling is in the unvisited part. The provided Order (003) text starts with the document header and goes through page 18, which includes the ruling. The \"Viewed tokens: 0-10000\" means the first 10k tokens were read, but the ruling is likely in that section. Wait, the document says it's 12,598 tokens total, and the excerpt provided in Step 9 covers up to page 18 (which is part of the 0-10000 tokens). The ruling about class certification is in the document, so it's probably already been read. But the current status shows only 3 values, so maybe it wasn't extracted yet.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 3\". The three values are from Order (001) and Order (002). The class certification ruling in Order (003) hasn't been added yet. So I need to extract that.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that after reading a document, I should append the extracted values. Since Order (003) was read partially (0-10000), but the ruling is in that section, I should check if it's already been processed. However, the prior steps don't show it being appended, so I need to append it now.\n\nWait, the current action is Step 9: read_document on Order (003) tokens 0-10000. The text provided in Step 9 includes the class certification ruling. So I should append that as a new value for Court_Rulings.\n\nThe ruling to extract is: \"The court granted Petitioners' Motion for Class Certification on May 6, 2025, certifying the class: 'All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.'\"\n\nEvidence: From Order (003), page 1, where it says \"The Court GRANTS Petitioners’ class certification motion, certifying the class Petitioners seek to represent: All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua’ and/or its implementation.\"\n\nSo I need to append this new value to Court_Rulings. Since this is a new value from Order (003), I should use append_checklist.\n\nThe next action should be append_checklist with the new value. The other documents might have more, but since Order (003) is partially visited and the ruling is in the read part, I should process it now.\n\nWait, the user's current status shows 3 values already, but the class certification ruling hasn't been included. So appending this fourth value would be correct. But the prior steps didn't mention it, so it's missing.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to append this new value using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"The court granted Petitioners' Motion for Class Certification on May 6, 2025, certifying the class: 'All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.'\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"The Court GRANTS Petitioners’ class certification motion, certifying the class Petitioners seek to represent: All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (003)\",\n                \"location\": \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 51 filed 05/06/25 USDC Colorado pg 1 of 23\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Court_Rulings", "extracted": [{"value": "The court granted Petitioners' Motion for Class Certification on May 6, 2025, certifying the class: 'All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.'", "evidence": [{"text": "The Court GRANTS Petitioners’ class certification motion, certifying the class Petitioners seek to represent: All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.", "source_document": "Order (003)", "location": "Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 51 filed 05/06/25 USDC Colorado pg 1 of 23"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 28328, "completion_tokens": 1523, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

However, the extraction instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"When reading partially visited documents... read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" \n\nCrucially, the checklist definition specifies: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" But the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 4\" and all Order documents (which are the main opinions) are fully visited. The other documents (like Complaints, Motions) are unlikely to contain new court rulings - they're typically the plaintiff's arguments, not the court's decisions.\n\n*Double-checking evidence requirements*: The extracted values so far are all from the court's actual orders (e.g., \"granted class certification\" in Order 003).
