Since there are no documents listed, I need to use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none, those can't be used yet. So the only correct action here is to call list_documents to discover the available documents.

The user needs me to extract all significant terms of decrees from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to the substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available documents. The snapshot shows 13 documents, all unvisited (marked with ○). The key is empty, so I need to find where these terms might be. Since the checklist specifically mentions court orders, the \"Order\" documents (Order 001 to 005) are the most likely candidates. Orders are typically where the court's decrees are stated.\n\nThe user has already done a list_documents step, so the catalog is known. Now, I should focus on reading the relevant documents. The \"Order\" documents have the highest token counts, especially Order (001) with 19,585 tokens. But since the maximum read per call is 10,000 tokens, I can't read the entire order at once. However, the first step is to read a portion of the most relevant document.\n\nLooking at the document list, Order (001) is the first Order and the largest, so it's probably the main decree. I should start by reading the beginning of Order (001) to see if it contains the terms. The start_token should be 0, and end_token up to 10,000. That way, I can check the initial part where the court's terms are usually listed.\n\nI should avoid reading all documents at once. Since the task is to extract decree terms, the Orders are the priority. The other documents like Complaints or Motions might reference terms but aren't the actual decrees. So, reading Order (001) first makes sense.\n\nCheck if the document is unvisited: yes, all are ○ Unvisited. So, read_document on Order (001) from 0 to 10,000 tokens. That's within the 10k limit. After reading, I'll analyze the text for any decree terms. If found, append them to the checklist. If not, move to the next document.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the target is specific to court orders, and the documents are labeled as Orders. Using read_document directly on the Order files is more efficient than regex. So the next action is to call read_document for Order (001) with the first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3613, "completion_tokens": 577, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all significant terms of decrees from legal documents, specifically from the provided snapshot. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and I need to find every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 13 documents. Step 2 was read_document on Order (001) for tokens 0-10000. The user provided the content of that read, which is the court order.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the Order (001) text to find any decree terms. The checklist says to extract substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. But I must not include terms only in settlement agreements unless incorporated into the court order.\n\nScanning through the Order (001) text, I see the court grants the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The key part is where the court sets forth its order. On page 2, it says:\n\n\"Because Petitioners have met this burden, the Court orders that Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class shall not be transferred outside the District of Colorado. The Court orders the following regarding the notice Respondents and the government must provide Petitioners and the provisionally certified class of individuals they seek to represent: Respondents shall provide a twenty-one (21) day notice to individuals detained pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. It must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review, and inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government's intent to remove them. Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.\"\n\nSo the decree terms here are:\n1. \"Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class shall not be transferred outside the District of Colorado.\"\n2. \"Respondents shall provide a twenty-one (21) day notice to individuals detained pursuant to the Act and Proclamation.\"\n3. \"Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation.\"\n4. \"Such notice must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review.\"\n5. \"Such notice must inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government's intent to remove them.\"\n6. \"Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.\"\n\nEach of these is a distinct substantive obligation ordered by the court. They're not just from a settlement agreement; they're directly ordered by the court in the decree.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are more terms. Looking further, I don't see additional decree terms in the provided text (only up to page 18). The rest of the document is about background, legal standards, and analysis, not the actual decree terms.\n\nSo, these six terms are the ones to extract. Each needs evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe document is \"Order (001)\", and the location is the text snippet I quoted. The tokens read were 0-10000, which covers the relevant parts (pages 2 and 3 where the order is stated).\n\nNow, for the action: Since I've found values in the document I just read, I should use append_checklist to add these entries. The checklist key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and I need to add each term as a separate entry with evidence.\n\nI must structure each evidence entry with:\n- text: the exact verbatim snippet\n- source_document: \"Order (001)\"\n- location: page number or token range. Since the text shows \"pg 2 of 35\" and \"pg 3 of 35\", I'll use the page numbers as location.\n\nWait, the document says \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 35 filed 04/22/25 USDC Colorado pg 2 of 35\" etc., so location can be \"page 2\" or \"page 3\".\n\nBut the evidence requires \"location\" as e.g., \"page, section, docket entry\". So \"page 2\" should be fine.\n\nNow, the values I have are the six terms listed above. I'll format each as an extracted entry with evidence.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure each is a separate entry in the extracted list. The checklist allows multiple values per key.\n\nSo the next action is to call append_checklist with the patch containing the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" and the extracted list of the six terms with their evidence.\n\nI should verify that these are all distinct and directly from the court order, not from the settlement. The text says \"The Court orders that...\" so they're court-ordered terms, not just settlement terms. Good.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, but the current read (Order 001) has provided the values, so I don't need to read more documents yet. I should append the values now.\n\nThe user's current status shows \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", so after appending, it should be filled.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use append_checklist with the six terms.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, specifically the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents. I've already processed two documents (Order 001 and Order 002), and they've provided the full text of both.\n\nLooking at the current status:\n- Only one checklist key exists: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\"\n- It already has 6 values extracted from Order (001)\n- The document catalog shows Order (001) and Order (002) are fully visited (100% coverage)\n- All other documents are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited)\n\nWait, but I just read Order (002) in Steps 5 and 6. The text from Order (002) mentions the notice requirements again in paragraph 19-20, but it's identical to what was already extracted from Order (001). Let me double-check:\n\nIn Order (002), on page 19-20, it says:\n\"Respondents shall provide a twenty-one (21) day notice to individuals detained pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation. It must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review, and inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government's intent to remove them. Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.\"\n\nThis is exactly the same as the 6 values extracted from Order (001). So no new unique terms are present here.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other documents that might contain additional terms. The catalog shows 13 documents total, but 11 are unvisited. However, the requirement is to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" from the corpus. Since Order (002) doesn't add new terms, and the other documents haven't been read yet, I should consider reading more documents to ensure completeness.\n\nBut wait - the checklist definition says: \"Extract each term as a separate value. If only part of a settlement is incorporated into an order, extract only the incorporated terms.\" Since the other documents (like the Complaint, Docket, etc.) might contain the decree terms, I need to check them.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action, analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items.\" Since I've already read two orders and found the terms, and the next step is to check if there are more terms in other documents.\n\nBut looking at the current status, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" key already has 6 values, and the catalog shows other documents are unvisited. The next logical step is to read another document that might contain the decree terms. The most likely candidates would be the other orders (Order 003-005) or the Complaint, but since Order (001) and (002) are the main orders, I should probably check Order (003) next.\n\nWait, but the user's task is to extract \"all\" terms. Since Order (002) didn't add new terms, and I need to make sure I haven't missed any documents that might contain different terms, I should read another document. The next one to read would be Order (003), as it's the next order in the sequence.\n\nBut let me check the document catalog again:\n- Order (001): fully visited\n- Order (002): fully visited\n- Order (003): 12,598 tokens, unvisited\n\nSo the next logical step is to read Order (003) to see if it contains any additional decree terms. I'll choose `read_document` for Order (003) with tokens 0-10000, since it's the first 10k tokens of that document.\n\nI should make sure not to read more than 10k tokens at once, as per the tool constraints. So the action will be `read_document` on Order (003) with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nThis is the correct next step because:\n1. Other documents haven't been read yet\n2. Order (003) is the next most relevant document to check\n3. I need to ensure all documents are checked for additional terms\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 38765, "completion_tokens": 989, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents.\n2. The checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" has already been partially extracted from Order (001).\n3. We have 6 values already extracted for this key from Order (001).\n4. The document catalog shows that Order (001) and Order (002) are fully visited (100% coverage), and Order (003) is partially visited (79% coverage).\n5. The remaining documents are unvisited.\n\nI need to determine if there are any additional values for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" that might be found in the remaining documents.\n\nLet's look at the documents that are partially or fully visited:\n\n- Order (001) is fully visited (100% coverage) and we already extracted all the terms from it.\n- Order (002) is fully visited (100% coverage) and we've read it completely (tokens 0-13539).\n- Order (003) is partially visited (79% coverage) - tokens 0-10000.\n\nNow, I should check if there's any mention of \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" in Order (002) or Order (003) that we haven't already extracted.\n\nFrom the provided text of Order (002), I don't see any additional decree terms that weren't already extracted from Order (001). The Order (002) text appears to be discussing the legal arguments and findings of the court, not providing new decree terms.\n\nFrom the provided text of Order (003), I don't see any additional decree terms either. The text appears to be discussing the class certification motion.\n\nLet me double-check the extraction from Order (001) to ensure we didn't miss anything:\n\nFrom Order (001), we extracted:\n1. \"Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class shall not be transferred outside the District of Colorado\"\n2. \"Respondents shall provide a twenty-one (21) day notice to individuals detained pursuant to the Act and Proclamation\"\n3. \"Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation\"\n4. \"Such notice must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review\"\n5. \"Such notice must inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government's intent to remove them\"\n6. \"Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands\"\n\nThese are all the decree terms we've extracted so far.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other documents that might contain additional decree terms. The checklist item specifically says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\"\n\nWe've checked Order (001) and Order (002) fully, and Order (003) partially. We need to determine if there are any other documents that might contain the decree terms.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, the other documents include:\n- Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n- Docket\n- Order (004)\n- Order (005)\n- Various motions and briefs\n\nThese documents are unlikely to contain the decree terms, as they are typically not the court orders themselves but rather the pleadings, motions, and other procedural documents.\n\nHowever, I should verify if Order (003) might contain additional decree terms in the unvisited portion (tokens 10001-12598). The provided text for Order (003) only shows tokens 0-10000, so there's still 2598 tokens unvisited.\n\nGiven that we've already extracted all the decree terms from Order (001) and Order (002), and Order (003) is a class certification order that likely doesn't contain decree terms (it's about the class, not the decree), I think the best next action is to check Order (003) for any additional decree terms in the unvisited portion.\n\nSo, I'll read the unvisited portion of Order (003) to see if there are any additional decree terms.\n\nI'll call `read_document` on Order (003) for tokens 10001-12598 (which is within the 10,000 token limit).\n\nWait, let me double-check the token count for Order (003):\n- Order (003) has 12,598 tokens total\n- We've already read tokens 0-10000 (10,000 tokens)\n- The unvisited tokens would be 10001-12598 (2,598 tokens)\n\nThis is well within the 10,000 token limit for a `read_document` call, so it's safe to read.\n\nLet me check the document catalog to confirm:\n- Order (003) [Order/Opinion] - 12,598 tokens - ◐ Partially Visited\n  Viewed tokens: 0-10000 (79% coverage)\n\nYes, this is the document we should read next.\n\nSo, the next action is to call `read_document` on Order (003) for tokens 10001-12598.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 12598}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 12598}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 38823, "completion_tokens": 1236, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
