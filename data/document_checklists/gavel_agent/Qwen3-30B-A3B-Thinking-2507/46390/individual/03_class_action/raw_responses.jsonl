The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

So I need to find where this information is likely located. The documents include a \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" which sounds relevant. That's a 9,444 token document, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call.\n\nThe other documents might have the info too, but the Motion for Class Certification is the most probable place.

The document is 9,444 tokens, so reading the whole thing is okay. The start_token should be 0, end_token 9444. That way, I get the entire document to check for mentions of class action status.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the document name directly relates to the checklist item.

The user needs me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first document I've read is \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" (tokens 0-9444). The user has already provided the content of this document. I need to check if this document contains the required information.\n\nScanning through the document, I see multiple references to the class action. For example, in the INTRODUCTION section: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation...\". \n\nFurther down, it says: \"The proposed class readily satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.\" and \"The Court should grant class certification under Rule 23(b)(2)\". \n\nAlso, in the BACKGROUND section: \"The Petitioners are several noncitizens from Venezuela, accused of affiliation with Tren de Aragua, who are detained at ICE’s Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado.\"\n\nThe document explicitly states that they are seeking class certification, and the plaintiffs are referred to as \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs\" (plural) with a proposed class. There's no mention of individual plaintiffs; it's clearly a class action.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". I need to find the exact evidence from the text. The most direct quote is in the INTRODUCTION: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class...\". \n\nFor evidence, I'll take the relevant snippet: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation.\"\n\nThe source document is \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\", and the location is the introduction section (page 1, as indicated by the header \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 4 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 1 of 18\").\n\nSince this document is already fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), I don't need to read it again. The evidence is clear from the text. Now, I need to append this to the checklist. The key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the value is \"Class Action\" as per the format.\n\nWait, the format specified is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\". So the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nI'll structure the evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be specified as \"pg 1 of 18\" as per the document header.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", with evidence from the text on page 1.\n\nNow, since this is the first value I'm extracting, I should use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nI need to make sure the evidence includes:\n- text: the verbatim snippet\n- source_document: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\"\n- location: \"pg 1 of 18\" (or more precisely, the document's page header)\n\nThe evidence array should have one entry with these details.\n\nSince this is the only value I've found so far, and the key was previously empty, appending this should fill the key. But I need to use append_checklist, not update_checklist, because it's the first entry.\n\nWait, the user says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the evidence text should be the specific sentence that supports the value.\n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation.\"\n\nSo the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" based on this.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist call should have:\n- key: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\"\n- extracted: [ { value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", evidence: [ { text: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation.\", source_document: \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\", location: \"pg 1 of 18\" } ] } ]\n\nI should check if there are other instances in the document, but since it's a motion for class certification, it's clear it's a class action. No individual plaintiffs mentioned. So this is the only value needed.\n\nThe document is fully visited, so no need to read more. The next step is to append this value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation.\", \"source_document\": \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\", \"location\": \"pg 1 of 18\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Class Action", "evidence": [{"text": "Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) seek to certify the following class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation.", "source_document": "Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification", "location": "pg 1 of 18"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13491, "completion_tokens": 1502, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and I need to make sure every distinct value is captured with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one value from the \"Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" document. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" with evidence from page 1. The document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are other documents that might have more values for this checklist item. The available documents list shows 12 unvisited documents (marked with ○ Unvisited). But since the checklist item is about class action status, I should focus on documents that are likely to mention it, like complaints, motions, or orders related to class certification.\n\nThe next step is to determine which document to read. The \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (Complaint) seems most relevant because it's a complaint, which typically states the nature of the lawsuit, including whether it's a class action. The other documents like docket entries or orders might not have the primary statement of the claim.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Complaint document. The token count is 10,707, which is under the 10,000 token limit for a single read, so I can read the entire document. But wait, the maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, and this document has 10,707 tokens. So I need to read it in chunks. However, the system says to read a targeted window ≤10,000 tokens. Since the document is 10,707 tokens, I can read tokens 0-10,000 first, and then maybe the remaining if needed. But the instructions say not to reread already visited tokens, and this document hasn't been visited at all. So starting with 0-10,000 is safe.\n\nWait, the document is listed as 10,707 tokens, so 0-10,000 would cover most of it, leaving 707 tokens. But since the user's task is to extract all values, and the document is unvisited, I should read the entire document. But the tool allows up to 10,000 tokens per call. So reading 0-10,000 is the first step. If more is needed, I can read the next chunk later. But since the document is only 10,707 tokens, reading 0-10,000 is the first step, and then maybe 10,000-10,707 next time. However, the current step is to choose one action, so I'll start with reading 0-10,000 of the Complaint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a regex search that could be more efficient. But the user's task is straightforward: find if the complaint states \"Class Action\" or \"Individual Plaintiffs\". The document name suggests it's a class complaint, so reading it directly makes sense. Using regex might be overkill here. So `read_document` is the right choice.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing other relevant documents. The \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" or \"Appellants-Respondents' Reply\" might mention the class status, but the complaint is the primary document where the plaintiff's claim is stated. So the Complaint is the highest priority.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be `read_document` on \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13657, "completion_tokens": 898, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already read the Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (tokens 0-9444) and successfully appended one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from that document. Then they read the Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint (tokens 0-10000), but the next step is to check if there's more to extract from this new document.\n\nLooking at the document they just read (Class Petition), the key part is in paragraph 61: \"Petitioners seek to represent the following Proposed Class: All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation...\". This confirms it's a class action, so the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" again. But since they already have that value from the first document, appending it again would be redundant. However, the checklist requires every distinct value. Since it's the same value, they don't need to add it again.\n\nWait, but the user's task says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Since \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" is the only value found so far, and it's the same in both documents, they don't need to append it again. The current status shows 1 value, which is correct.\n\nNow, checking if there are other documents that might have different values. The available documents include a Docket, several Orders, and other motions. But the Docket and Orders might not mention the class action status directly. The next logical step is to check if the \"Class Petition\" document has any other mentions of class action. But the user already read up to 10,000 tokens (93% coverage), and the key part was already covered in the first part of the document.\n\nWait, the document they read (Class Petition) has the class definition in paragraph 61, which is the same as the Motion for Class Certification. So no new distinct value here. The other documents like the Docket or Orders might not contain the class action status, as they're likely procedural. The \"Docket\" might have a summary, but it's unvisited. However, the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is typically in the complaint or motion, not the docket.\n\nThe current status shows \"Keys with Values\": 1/1, meaning all keys are filled. The only key is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, which has one value. So they should stop. But wait, they need to confirm if there are any other values. Since they've read two documents that both confirm it's a class action, and no other documents have been read that might say otherwise (like individual plaintiffs), it's safe to conclude that the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" and it's the only one.\n\nBut the user's recent action was reading the Class Petition document (tokens 0-10000), and they haven't appended any new values from it yet. Wait, no—step 4 was reading that document, but they haven't done an append_checklist yet. Wait, looking back at the \"Recent Actions\", step 4 is \"read_document\" on the Class Petition, and now the current status shows that the checklist has 1 value. But the user hasn't appended the value from the Class Petition yet. Wait, no—the previous step (step 3) was append_checklist for the first document. Now, after reading the second document, they need to check if there's a new value to append.\n\nBut the value from the second document is the same as the first. So appending it again would be redundant. The system's rules say to extract every distinct value. Since it's the same value, it shouldn't be added again. Therefore, there's no new value to append. The checklist is already complete with one value.\n\nThe \"Current Status\" shows \"Keys with Values\": 1/1, meaning the one key is filled. So they should stop. But the user needs to confirm with get_checklist first? Wait, the stop criteria say to verify state with get_checklist before stopping. But the user has already extracted the value, and the status shows it's filled. However, according to the process, they should use get_checklist to check if all keys are filled. Wait, but the system says \"Before stopping, verify state with get_checklist (in a prior turn if needed)\".\n\nIn this case, since the only key has a value, and it's correct, the next step would be to call get_checklist to confirm, then stop. But the user's current action is to decide the next step. The available options are to do an action or stop. Since the checklist is complete, they should stop.\n\nWait, but the \"Current Status\" says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, they can stop. The evidence is already there from the first document, and the second document confirms it but doesn't add a new value.
