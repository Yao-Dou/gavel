The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I need to use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none, those can't be used yet.

The user needs me to extract all significant terms of decrees from the provided documents. First, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain the decree terms. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to the substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the ones labeled as [Order/Opinion] (Order 001 to 004) are the most probable sources because court orders typically contain the actual decree terms. The other documents like Complaints, Dockets, and Motions are less likely to have the final decree terms unless they reference an order. The Docket might list orders but probably not the detailed terms. The Complaints and Motions would have the requests but not the court's actual order.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, and the only key to extract is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". Since there are four Order documents, I should start by checking the most substantial ones first. Order (001) is the largest at 7,735 tokens, which is under the 10,000 token limit for a read_document call. It's marked as unvisited, so I should read that first.\n\nI need to make sure I don't read the entire document at once if it's too big, but 7,735 tokens is acceptable. The next step is to use read_document on Order (001) from start_token 0 to 7735. That should give me the full content to search for decree terms. After reading, I'll analyze the text for any mentions of terms like \"order\", \"injunction\", \"consent decree\", etc., and then use append_checklist to add those terms with evidence.\n\nWait, but the user said to use exactly one action per turn. So the first action should be to read the Order (001) document. The other orders are smaller, but starting with the largest makes sense. Also, the Docket might have references, but the Orders are the primary sources. So the next action is read_document for Order (001).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7735}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7735}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3488, "completion_tokens": 508, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Since Order (001) was fully read and didn't have the terms, I need to look at other documents. The checklist item specifies that the terms must be in the court's order, not just the settlement agreement. So, I should focus on other orders or opinions.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (002), Order (003), and Order (004) are all orders/opinions. Order (001) was read, so the next logical step is to read another order. Order (002) is small (1,176 tokens), so reading it entirely is efficient. The user's goal is to find decree terms, so checking other orders makes sense. The previous action was reading Order (001), which didn't yield anything. Now, moving to Order (002) seems appropriate. Since it's unvisited, I'll use read_document on Order (002) from tokens 0-1176. That's within the 10k token limit. No need for regex here because the document is small and likely contains the decree terms if they exist.

The user needs me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item definition says to extract substantive court-ordered obligations, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments, but only if they're incorporated into the court order. Not to include terms from settlement agreements unless expressly ordered by the court.\n\nLooking at the current status: all 10 documents are listed, but only Order (001) and Order (002) have been fully read. The other 8 documents are unvisited. The checklist for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees is empty.\n\nFirst, I should check if the already-read documents contain any decree terms. Let me scan Order (001) again. The order is about transferring jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade. The court didn't issue any injunctions or decrees here—it just transferred the case. The key parts mention \"IT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Transfer... is GRANTED\" and \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Stay... is DENIED AS MOOT.\" There's no substantive decree terms here; it's purely procedural.\n\nNow Order (002) is a denial of a motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal. The court says it's denying the motion because the original order didn't address the merits of the injunction. Again, no substantive decree terms—just procedural rulings.\n\nSo the two read documents don't have any Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. The checklist is still empty. The next logical step is to check other documents that might contain the actual decree terms. The most likely candidates would be the Complaint, First Amended Complaint, or any Orders that actually issue a decree (like Order (003) or (004)), but those haven't been read yet.\n\nThe user's instructions say to read documents that likely contain the target value. Since the two orders read don't have the terms, I should move to documents that are more likely to contain the decree. The Complaint and First Amended Complaint might have settlement terms, but the checklist says to only extract terms expressly incorporated into the court order. So maybe the actual decree is in a later order.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (003) and (004) are orders/opinions that might contain decrees. But I should check which document is most likely. The \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" item is about the court's order, so the actual decree would be in the court's order, not in the complaint. So Order (003) or (004) are better bets than the complaints.\n\nBut since I haven't read Order (003) yet, and it's unvisited, the next step should be to read that. The document is 7,217 tokens, which is under the 10,000 limit for a read_document call. So I'll choose to read Order (003) from tokens 0-7217.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions show that they've already read Order (001) and (002) fully. The next document to read should be one that's unvisited. Order (003) is unvisited, so that's the logical next step. I shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because there's no clear pattern mentioned, and the checklist is about specific terms that might be in the order text.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call read_document on Order (003) for the full document (tokens 0-7217).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7217}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7217}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12918, "completion_tokens": 798, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item definition says to extract substantive court-ordered obligations, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. The key instruction is to only include terms expressly incorporated into court orders, not just settlement agreements.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've read three orders (001, 002, 003) but haven't found any decree terms yet. Let me scan the text again for any court-ordered terms.\n\nStarting with Order (001): This is a transfer order. The court says \"IT IS ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Transfer... is GRANTED.\" But it's just transferring jurisdiction - no substantive decree terms. The order mentions \"the Court of International Trade\" but that's procedural, not a substantive decree. No terms like \"must pay X\" or \"must cease Y\" here.\n\nOrder (002) is about denying a preliminary injunction. The court says \"IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion... is DENIED.\" Again, no substantive terms - it's just denying a request.\n\nOrder (003) is denying reconsideration. Similar pattern: \"IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion... is DENIED.\" No substantive terms.\n\nHmm... the problem is these are all procedural orders, not final decrees with substantive terms. The actual decree terms might be in other documents like the Complaint or Amended Complaint, which are still unvisited. The user's catalog shows \"Complaint\" and \"First Amended Complaint\" as unvisited (○ Unvisited).\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So I need to find where the court actually ordered specific terms, not just mentioned them.\n\nSince the three orders read so far are all about jurisdiction transfer and denial of motions, not actual decrees, I should look for documents that contain the actual decree. The \"First Amended Complaint\" might have the terms plaintiffs are seeking, but the checklist says to extract court-ordered terms, not plaintiff claims. So I need the court's order that incorporates terms.\n\nWait - the \"Order (001)\" mentions \"Executive Order 14193\" and \"Executive Order 14257\" but those are presidential orders, not court decrees. The court isn't ordering those - it's just referencing them.\n\nI think the key is that the court hasn't issued a substantive decree yet - it's only transferred jurisdiction. The actual decree terms might be in a future order, but the documents provided don't show it. The user's corpus has 10 documents, and the only orders read are 001-003, all procedural.\n\nBut the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If there are no substantive decree terms in any document, then it should be marked \"Not Applicable.\" But the instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\"\n\nIs there any document that might contain a decree? The \"Complaint\" and \"Amended Complaint\" are unvisited. Let me check the document types:\n\n- Complaint: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" - this is plaintiff's claim, not court order. It might mention terms they want, but those aren't court-ordered.\n- First Amended Complaint: same issue.\n- Docket: procedural timeline, probably not.\n- Order (004): 509 tokens, unvisited - could be the actual decree.\n\nAh! Order (004) is unvisited and only 509 tokens. It might be the final decree. The previous orders were transfer orders, so Order (004) might contain the substantive terms.\n\nI should read Order (004) next. It's small (509 tokens), so I can read the whole thing in one call. The token count is low, so no need for regex search.\n\nBefore that, let me confirm: the user has 10 documents, three orders read (001-003), and Order (004) is next in line. Since it's unvisited and small, reading it is efficient.\n\nSo my next action should be `read_document` for Order (004) from tokens 0-509.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (004)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 509}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (004)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 509}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 20509, "completion_tokens": 990, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting all distinct substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments, but only if they're expressly incorporated into the court order. So I need to look for any specific terms or obligations mentioned in the court orders.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: the user has already read four orders (Order 001 to 004). Let me check each of those for any decree terms.\n\nStarting with Order (001). The document is a court order granting the motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade. The order states that the case will be transferred, but there's no mention of any decree terms like specific obligations or injunctions. The court is just transferring the case, not issuing any decree with terms. So no significant terms here.\n\nOrder (002) is an order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explains that the district court is divested of jurisdiction after a notice of appeal, so the motion is denied. Again, no substantive decree terms; it's just a procedural order.\n\nOrder (003) is a denial of a motion for reconsideration. The court discusses jurisdiction but doesn't impose any new terms or decrees. The order reaffirms the transfer to the CIT but doesn't add any specific obligations. So again, no decree terms.\n\nOrder (004) is an appellate court order staying proceedings until the district court rules on a motion. It's a procedural order, not a decree with terms.\n\nSo none of the orders read so far contain any decree terms. The checklist item is about the substantive obligations ordered by the court, like specific injunctions or decrees. Since the orders are about jurisdiction transfer and denial of motions, they don't include such terms.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The available documents include the Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Docket, and various briefs. The Complaint might have the plaintiffs' requests, but the decree terms would be in the court's order, not the complaint. However, the instruction says to extract terms from court orders, not the complaint. But maybe the complaint mentions terms that were later incorporated into an order.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So the key is to find terms that are in the court's order. But the court orders read so far don't have any. The other documents might not have the court's order, but perhaps the Docket or other pleadings mention the decree terms. However, the Docket is a summary of filings, not the order itself.\n\nWait, the user has read four orders, all of which are court orders, but none contain decree terms. The next logical step is to check other documents that might contain the actual decree. The available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"First Amended Complaint\", but those are filed by the plaintiffs, not the court's order. The court's order would be the one granting or denying the injunction, which hasn't been found yet.\n\nWait, in Order (001), the court says: \"IT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Transfer to the United States Court of International Trade (Doc. 18) is GRANTED.\" But that's just a transfer order, not a decree with terms. Similarly, the other orders are about jurisdiction, not specific decrees.\n\nSo perhaps the decree terms are in a different document. The \"Docket\" might list the orders, but the actual text of the decree would be in the order document. The user has read four order documents, but maybe there's a fifth order that's been overlooked. Wait, the available documents list 10 documents, and the user has read four orders (001-004), so there are six more. But the checklist item is about the decree terms, which would be in the court's order. Since the first four orders don't have them, maybe the next step is to check other order documents. Wait, the available documents list \"Order (001)\" to \"Order (004)\" as fully visited, but there might be more order documents. Wait, the document catalog shows 10 documents, and the orders are four of them. The other six are complaint, docket, etc.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions show they read Order 001 to 004, which are all orders. The next step is to check if any of the other documents might contain the decree terms. But the decree terms would be in the court's order, so perhaps the other order documents (like Order 005, etc.) haven't been read yet. But the catalog lists only four orders as fully visited, and the others are unvisited. Wait, the available documents list \"Order (001)\" to \"Order (004)\" as fully visited, but the document catalog might have more orders. Wait, the user's document catalog shows:\n\n- Order (001) to Order (004) as fully visited.\n\nBut the catalog says there are 10 documents total, so the other six are unvisited. The other documents are:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n- First Amended Complaint\n- Docket\n- Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\n- Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\n- Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union\n\nNone of these are court orders that would contain decree terms. The court orders are the ones labeled as \"Order (001)\" etc. So maybe the decree terms are in a different order. Wait, but the user has read four orders, and the next order might be Order (005), but it's not listed in the available documents. Wait, the available documents list \"Order (001)\" to \"Order (004)\", but the catalog says 10 documents. Wait, maybe the other six include more orders, but the names don't have \"Order\" in them. Wait, the catalog lists:\n\n- Order (001) [Order/Opinion] - fully visited\n- Order (002) [Order/Opinion] - fully visited\n- Order (003) [Order/Opinion] - fully visited\n- Order (004) [Order/Opinion] - fully visited\n- The rest are Complaint, Docket, etc.\n\nSo there are only four order documents. The user has read all four, and none contain decree terms. Therefore, perhaps the decree terms are not present in any of the documents, so the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the checklist says to mark Not Applicable only if there's explicit evidence. The user needs to confirm that there are no decree terms. Since all the court orders read so far are about jurisdiction transfer and not issuing any decrees with terms, it's possible that there are no decree terms to extract. The plaintiffs were seeking an injunction, but the court denied it (in Order 002), so there's no decree. The transfer orders don't impose any obligations.\n\nSo the next step would be to use `update_checklist` to set \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence. The evidence would be the court orders stating that the case was transferred and no injunction was granted, so no decree terms exist.\n\nWait, but the user needs to make sure they haven't missed any documents. The available documents include the Complaint, which might mention the terms they're seeking, but the checklist says to extract only terms ordered by the court, not in the complaint. So even if the complaint lists terms, unless they're in the court's order, they shouldn't be included.\n\nIn Order (002), the court says: \"the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 42)\". So the court did not grant an injunction, hence no decree terms. Similarly, Order (001) transferred the case without issuing any decree. Order (003) denied reconsideration, and Order (004) is an appellate order staying proceedings.\n\nTherefore, there are no decree terms to extract. So the correct action is to update the checklist for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the court orders.\n\nThe evidence should include the relevant parts from the orders where the court denied the injunction or transferred the case without imposing terms. For example, in Order (002), the court states: \"IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal (Doc. 42) is DENIED.\" This shows that no injunction (and thus no decree terms) was granted.\n\nSo the next action should be `update_checklist` with the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" set to \"Not Applicable\", using the evidence from Order (002).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal (Doc. 42) is DENIED.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (002)\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 3, line 3\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 47)\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (003)\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 3, line 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal (Doc. 42) is DENIED.", "source_document": "Order (002)", "location": "Page 3, line 3"}, {"text": "the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 47)", "source_document": "Order (003)", "location": "Page 3, line 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21109, "completion_tokens": 2104, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" checklist item from the legal documents provided. The previous steps have already processed Orders 001 through 004, and the last action was an update_checklist setting Significant_Terms_of_Decrees to \"Not Applicable\" based on evidence from Order (002) and Order (003).\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are either filled or marked as Not Applicable. The checklist has only one item, which is now marked as Not Applicable. The evidence provided was from the Orders denying the preliminary injunction, which shows that there's no decree with substantive terms ordered by the court. The key point here is that the checklist requires extracting terms from court orders (consent decrees or stipulated judgments), but the Orders here are just about jurisdiction and transfer, not about issuing a decree with terms.\n\nThe user's instructions say that \"Not Applicable\" should be set when there's explicit evidence that the item doesn't apply. In this case, the court didn't issue any decree with terms; they transferred the case and denied the injunction motion. So the evidence from Order (002) and (003) supports that there are no decree terms to extract.\n\nThe available documents include unvisited ones like the Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Docket, etc. But since the checklist item is already marked as Not Applicable, and the evidence is solid (the court didn't issue a decree with terms), there's no need to read more documents. The checklist item is correctly marked as Not Applicable based on the evidence from the orders that were read.\n\nThe system's Stop Criteria say to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. Here, the only key is marked as Not Applicable with proper evidence. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The previous step (Step 6) was an update_checklist that set Significant_Terms_of_Decrees to Not Applicable. The current status shows 1 key with Not Applicable, and no empty keys. The documents left unvisited don't seem relevant because the decree terms would be in the orders, which were already read. The Complaint and other documents might have settlement terms, but the checklist specifies that only terms expressly incorporated into the court order count. Since the court orders here don't mention any decree terms, and the orders were read, there's no need to check other documents.\n\nThe evidence provided in the update_checklist was from Order (002) and (003), which state the motion for preliminary injunction was denied, so no decree was issued. Therefore, it's correct to mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop, as all keys are handled.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Significant_Terms_of_Decrees) are marked as 'Not Applicable' with explicit evidence from court orders denying preliminary injunctions (Order 002, Page 3; Order 003, Page 3), confirming no substantive decree terms were ordered by the court.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items (Significant_Terms_of_Decrees) are marked as 'Not Applicable' with explicit evidence from court orders denying preliminary injunctions (Order 002, Page 3; Order 003, Page 3), confirming no substantive decree terms were ordered by the court.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21287, "completion_tokens": 665, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract checklist items from legal documents, specifically the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" item. The task is to find all distinct values of this item in the documents.\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already marked \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from Order (002) and Order (003). The evidence cited is the court denying preliminary injunctions, which means there's no substantive decree ordered. The user's step 6 and 7 show that they've already updated the checklist with \"Not Applicable\" and tried to stop.\n\nNow, the available documents show that 4 orders are fully visited (001-004), but there are 6 other documents unvisited: Complaints, Docket, Motions, etc. However, the checklist definition says to extract terms from court orders, not settlement agreements. The key point here is that the court orders (002 and 003) denied the injunctions, so there's no decree to extract. The Not Applicable was correctly set because the orders didn't include any substantive decree terms.\n\nThe system's automatic checklist review after the first stop shows that all keys are marked as Not Applicable. The user has 1 key, and it's marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The next step is to confirm if there's any reason to keep looking. But the definition says to mark as Not Applicable when the court didn't order any terms, which is the case here. The unvisited documents are complaints and motions, which aren't court orders. The checklist specifically says to extract from court orders (like decrees), not from motions or complaints. So even if we read the other documents, they wouldn't contain the decree terms because the court didn't issue any.\n\nThe user's step 7 called stop, and the system automatically ran get_checklist, showing the key is filled as Not Applicable. The current status says 1/1 filled, 0 empty, 1/1 Not Applicable. So all required items are handled. The next action should be to stop again since there's no more work to do. The system even says this is stop attempt 1/2, and it's okay to stop now.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Significant_Terms_of_Decrees) are marked as 'Not Applicable' with explicit evidence from court orders (Order 002, Page 3; Order 003, Page 3) confirming no substantive decree terms were ordered.
