The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the documents. The checklist says to get the type of counsel for each side, like Plaintiff or Defendant, using specific labels.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The complaint documents (Complaint and First Amended Complaint) usually have the parties and their counsel mentioned at the beginning. The Docket might list counsel as well, but the Complaints are probably the best starting point.\n\nThe user provided a list of 10 documents, all unvisited. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the first one, 21k tokens. Since it's a complaint, the counsel info is likely in the first few pages. But the token count is high, so I shouldn't read the whole thing. Instead, maybe use a regex search to find mentions of \"counsel\" or \"attorney\" to pinpoint the relevant sections.\n\nWait, the instructions say to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. The key here is \"Type_of_Counsel\", which might be indicated by phrases like \"counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"represented by\". So a regex pattern like \"counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" could work. But the user mentioned using precise patterns tied to document structure. Let me think of a better regex. Maybe \"counsel for Plaintiff: [^,]+|counsel for Defendant: [^,]+\" but need to make sure it's anchored.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"counsel\" followed by the side. But to avoid false positives, maybe look for \"Plaintiff's counsel\" or \"Defendant's counsel\". Let's go with a regex that captures those phrases. The pattern could be: r\"(Plaintiff|Defendant)'s counsel:\\s*([^\\n]+)\"\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract specific labels like \"private counsel\", \"government counsel\", etc. So the actual text might say \"Plaintiff is represented by private counsel (Smith & Jones)\".\n\nSo the regex should look for \"Plaintiff's counsel\" or \"Defendant's counsel\" followed by the type. Let's use a pattern like: r\"(Plaintiff|Defendant)('s| )counsel\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*([^\\n]+)\"\n\nBut maybe simpler: r\"counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant): ([^,]+)\"\n\nWait, the example given in the checklist is \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Smith & Jones)\". So the text might have \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Smith & Jones)\".\n\nSo the regex could be: r\"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\\s*([^\\n]+)\"\n\nBut need to make sure it's capturing the type. Let's use that. Since it's a regex search, I'll set the pattern to find \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" followed by the counsel type.\n\nAlso, the documents are all unvisited, so I should search the Complaint first. But the tool allows searching specific documents or all. Since the Complaint is the most likely, maybe search just that document. But the user said to use `search_document_regex` with doc_name='Complaint' or similar.\n\nWait, the document names are given. The first document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with [Complaint] tag. So the doc_name would be \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSo the action should be to search that specific document for the pattern. The parameters for search_document_regex would have doc_name as the specific document, pattern as the regex.\n\nLet me confirm the parameters. The function requires \"pattern\", and optionally doc_name or doc_names. Since the Complaint is the most relevant, I'll set doc_name to \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSo the regex pattern: r\"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\\s*([^\\n]+)\"\n\nBut need to make sure it's case-insensitive? Maybe add IGNORECASE flag. The example uses \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" capitalized, but maybe the text uses lowercase. So flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]\n\nTop_k: 5, context_tokens: 200.\n\nSo the tool call would be search_document_regex with doc_name as the complaint document, pattern as the regex, flags to include IGNORECASE.\n\nThat should find the relevant sections quickly without reading the whole document. Then, once I get the matches, I can read the context to confirm and extract the values.\n\nSo the next action is to use search_document_regex on the Complaint document with the pattern to find counsel mentions.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"pattern\": \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\\\\s*([\\\\w\\\\s,()]+)\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "(Plaintiff|Defendant):\\s*([\\w\\s,()]+)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3498, "completion_tokens": 1062, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from legal documents. The checklist requires distinct values for plaintiff and defendant counsel, using specific labels and including organizations in parentheses.\n\nLooking at the current status: all keys are empty, and there are 10 unvisited documents. The recent action was a search_document_regex on the Complaint with a pattern for Plaintiff/Defendant, but it found 0 matches. Hmm, maybe the regex wasn't specific enough. The pattern used was \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\\s*([\\w\\s,()]+)\", but perhaps the actual text uses different formatting, like \"Plaintiff:\" followed by a newline or different punctuation.\n\nThe available documents include Complaints, Dockets, Orders, and Motions. The Docket might have counsel info listed, like in the case caption or entries. The Orders might mention counsel in the context of motions. The Complaints themselves might state who is representing each side, but the initial regex search missed it. Maybe the regex needs to be adjusted to capture more variations.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the regex search on the Complaint found 0 matches. But maybe the Complaint document doesn't have the counsel type listed there. Sometimes, the counsel info is in the Docket or the initial filing. The Docket (Docket) is a separate document. It's possible that the Docket lists the attorneys for each party. So, maybe I should check the Docket next.\n\nThe Docket document is 4,974 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading it directly is feasible. Since the previous regex on the Complaint didn't work, perhaps the counsel info is in the Docket. Let's plan to read the entire Docket document to find any mentions of counsel for plaintiff and defendant.\n\nAnother thought: the regex pattern might not have been anchored properly. Maybe using a more specific pattern for the Docket, like looking for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" in the Docket entries. But since the previous search didn't find anything, maybe the Docket is the next logical step.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Docket document. The Docket is listed as unvisited, so reading it entirely (start_token 0 to end_token 4974) would be safe. The Docket might have the counsel information in the case caption or in the docket entries. For example, the Docket might show \"Plaintiff: Jane Doe, Esq. (Smith & Co.)\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Orders mention counsel in the context of motions. But the Docket is more likely to have the initial counsel info. Let's go with reading the Docket first.

Then they read the Docket document (tokens 0-4974) which is fully visited. The Docket entries show mentions of counsel. For example, in entry 3: \"Monica Tranel appearing for Plaintiffs Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" So the plaintiff's counsel is Monica Tranel, but the type isn't specified yet. Wait, the Type_of_Counsel needs to be a category like private counsel, government, etc.\n\nWait, the Docket entries mention \"Monica Tranel\" for plaintiffs and \"Luke Mathers\" for defendants. But the type of counsel (e.g., private, government) isn't directly stated here. The checklist requires the type, not just the name. So maybe the documents need to be checked for more details.\n\nThe available documents include Complaint, First Amended Complaint, and other briefs.

Since the Docket only lists names, but not the type, I need to look at the Complaint document.\n\nThe document catalog shows \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is unvisited. So the next action should be to read that document. The user can read up to 10,000 tokens.

The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. The user has provided the current status, recent actions, and the documents available.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions. Steps 1-4 have been done. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was a regex search on the Complaint document for Plaintiff/Defendant names, but found 0 matches. Step 3 was reading the Docket document (tokens 0-4974), which is fully visited. Step 4 was reading the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000), which is partially visited (46% coverage).\n\nNow, the current status shows that Type_of_Counsel is empty. The available documents include the Complaint (partially visited), Docket (fully visited), and others unvisited. The Docket was read in Step 3, and the Complaint in Step 4. The Docket entries mention attorneys, like Monica Tranel for Plaintiffs and Luke Mathers for Defendants. The Complaint document's attorney info is at the top.\n\nWait, the Docket (Step 3) had entries like:\n- \"MOTION for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction. Monica Tranel appearing for Plaintiffs Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\"\n- \"NOTICE of Appearance by Luke Mathers on behalf of All Defendants\"\n\nSo, in the Docket, Monica Tranel is listed as representing the Plaintiffs, and Luke Mathers for Defendants. The Complaint document (Step 4) also lists Monica J. Tranel as the attorney for Plaintiffs.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting the type of counsel. The examples given include \"private counsel\", \"public interest nonprofit\", etc. Here, Monica Tranel is from Tranel Law Firm, which is a private law firm. Luke Mathers is appearing for Defendants, and the document says \"Luke Mathers appearing for Defendants Kristi Noem, The United States of America, U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\" The Defendants include government entities, so Luke Mathers might be government counsel, but the document doesn't specify if he's a government attorney or a private lawyer representing the government.\n\nWait, the Defendants are the U.S. government entities, so Luke Mathers is likely a government attorney (e.g., from the Department of Justice), but the document doesn't explicitly say that. The Docket entry says \"Luke Mathers appearing for Defendants\" but doesn't state his firm. However, the Complaint document's attorney info shows Monica Tranel's firm as \"TRANEL LAW FIRM, P.C.\", which is private.\n\nFor the Plaintiffs, Monica Tranel is private counsel. For the Defendants, since they are government entities, the counsel is likely government counsel. But the document doesn't explicitly state \"government counsel\" or \"DOJ\". However, when a government agency is a defendant, the counsel is typically from the Department of Justice, so \"government counsel\" would be the category.\n\nSo, Type_of_Counsel should have two entries: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\".\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nSo, for Plaintiff, it's private counsel with the firm name. For Defendant, since it's the U.S. government, it's government counsel.\n\nBut need to check if the evidence supports this. The Docket entry says \"Monica Tranel appearing for Plaintiffs\" and her firm is listed in the Complaint. The Complaint's header shows her as \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\" with her law firm.\n\nFor the Defendants, Luke Mathers is \"appearing for Defendants\", and the Defendants are the U.S. government, so it's government counsel. The document doesn't say \"Department of Justice\", but it's standard for government defendants to be represented by government counsel.\n\nSo, the extracted values would be:\n\n- Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\n- Defendant: government counsel\n\nNow, need to verify if the evidence is in the documents. The Docket has the entries, and the Complaint has the attorney info. Since the Docket was fully read (Step 3), and the Complaint was partially read (Step 4), but the attorney info is in the Complaint's header (page 1), which was included in the tokens read (0-10000). So the evidence for Plaintiff is in the Complaint (page 1), and for Defendant in the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 10 says \"NOTICE of Appearance by Luke Mathers on behalf of All Defendants (Mathers, Luke)\". So the evidence for Defendant's counsel is in the Docket document.\n\nSo, two entries: one for Plaintiff from Complaint, one for Defendant from Docket.\n\nNow, need to use append_checklist to add these. But the checklist key is Type_of_Counsel, and each entry should be a separate value.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each entry needs evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nFor Plaintiff:\n- Value: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\"\n- Evidence: \n  - text: \"Monica J. Tranel\\nTRANEL LAW FIRM, P.C.\\n401 Washington Street\\nMissoula, MT  59802\"\n  - source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n  - location: \"Page 1\"\n\nFor Defendant:\n- Value: \"Defendant: government counsel\"\n- Evidence:\n  - text: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Luke Mathers on behalf of All Defendants (Mathers, Luke)\"\n  - source_document: \"Docket\"\n  - location: \"Event 10\"\n\nWait, the Defendant's type is government counsel. But the document doesn't explicitly say \"government counsel\", but since the Defendants are government entities (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, etc.), the counsel is government counsel. So the value should be \"Defendant: government counsel\" as per the checklist's instruction to use category labels.\n\nThe checklist says: \"the type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\"\n\nSo, for Plaintiffs, it's private counsel with the firm name. For Defendants, it's government counsel (since it's the government, no specific organization needed beyond the category).\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to Type_of_Counsel. Since the previous steps read the Docket and Complaint, and the evidence is present, the next step is to call append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nCheck if the document catalog is known: yes, list_documents was called. The documents are known. No need for list_documents again.\n\nThe Docket is fully visited, so no need to read it again. The Complaint was partially visited, but the attorney info is in the first 10k tokens, which were read in Step 4.\n\nSo, the correct action is to append the two entries for Type_of_Counsel.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Monica J.

The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. The user has provided a snapshot of the current state after several steps.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions: Steps 1-5 have been completed. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 used search_document_regex on the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief but found 0 matches. Step 3 read the Docket document (tokens 0-4974), and Step 4 read the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000). Step 5 used append_checklist to add two entries for Type_of_Counsel.\n\nCurrent status shows that Type_of_Counsel has two values: one from the Complaint (Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)) and one from the Docket (Defendant: government counsel). The Docket document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and the Complaint document is partially visited (◐ Partially Visited, 46% coverage).\n\nThe checklist item Type_of_Counsel is marked as having 2 values, so all keys are filled. But I need to check if there are any other documents that might have more entries for Type_of_Counsel. The available documents list shows that some are unvisited (like the First Amended Complaint, other Orders, etc.), but the current extraction has two values.\n\nWait, the user's requirements say to extract EVERY distinct value. The two values found are from the Complaint (Plaintiff's counsel) and Docket (Defendant's counsel). The Docket's Event 10 mentions Luke Mathers appearing for All Defendants, which is government counsel. The Complaint's attorney info shows Monica Tranel from Tranel Law Firm, P.C., which is private counsel.\n\nBut I should check if other documents might have more counsel types. For example, the First Amended Complaint might have different counsel info, or other motions. However, the current checklist summary shows that Type_of_Counsel has 2 values, and the empty keys are 0. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the current state says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The two values are already extracted. The user's Step 5 already appended both values. So maybe there's no need to read more documents. But let me confirm.\n\nThe Docket is fully visited, so no more tokens to read there. The Complaint is partially visited (0-10000 out of 21,685), but the extracted values were found in the first 10,000 tokens. The Complaint's attorney info is on Page 1, which is within the first 10k tokens. The Defendant's counsel (Luke Mathers) was found in the Docket, which is fully read.\n\nAre there other documents that might have counsel information? For example, the \"Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\" might list counsel. But the checklist is only about Type_of_Counsel, and the two values found are from the main complaint and docket. The user's instructions say to extract every distinct value. Since the current extraction has two values (Plaintiff and Defendant), and the checklist doesn't mention any other sides (like intervenors), maybe that's all.\n\nWait, the Montana Farmers Union filed a Motion to Intervene, but their counsel is listed as SGN (which might be a law firm, but the user's example for Type_of_Counsel says to use brief labels like \"public interest nonprofit\" etc. The SGN in the Docket for Event 31 says \"Jesse Laslovich appearing for Interested Party Montana Farmers Union\" with \"SGN\" as the firm. But the user's Step 5 didn't include this. However, the checklist item specifies \"if both sides are represented, extract each as separate values\". The Montana Farmers Union is an intervenor, not a defendant, so maybe they're not part of the main counsel types. The checklist says \"the type of counsel representing each side\", so the main sides are Plaintiff and Defendant. The intervenor might be a third party, but the user's example doesn't include third parties. The existing values are Plaintiff: private counsel, Defendant: government counsel. The intervenor's counsel (SGN) might be another entry, but the user's Step 5 didn't extract it. Wait, but the Step 5 says \"Successfully appended 1 key: Type_of_Counsel\" with two values. So maybe the intervenor isn't considered a \"side\" in the same way. The checklist definition says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as separate values\", implying Plaintiff and Defendant. The intervenor is a third party, so perhaps not required here.\n\nBut the current state shows that Type_of_Counsel has two values. The user's recent action (Step 5) already appended those two. The checklist summary shows 2 values, so it's complete. The next step should be to check if there's any missing value. However, the documents that are unvisited (like the First Amended Complaint) might have more counsel info. Wait, the First Amended Complaint might have the same counsel, or maybe different. But since the initial Complaint already listed the plaintiff's counsel, and the Docket listed the defendant's, and the intervenor's counsel isn't part of the main sides, maybe no more values are needed.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"the type of counsel representing each side\". The main sides are Plaintiff and Defendant. The intervenor is not a side in the same sense; they're an intervenor. So the two values found are sufficient.\n\nThe current status shows that all keys are filled (1/1), so the next action should be to stop. The user's stop criteria say to stop when every key is complete. Since Type_of_Counsel has two values and is fully extracted, the system should stop.\n\nBut let me confirm: the checklist has only one item, Type_of_Counsel, and it's filled. The extraction progress shows 2 values. So the answer should be to stop.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present... or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is complete. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nThe previous step (Step 5) already appended the two values, so there's no need for more actions.

The user is asking me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The task is to find all distinct values for the type of counsel representing each side (Plaintiff and Defendant) with proper evidence.\n\nLooking at the provided snapshot, the previous steps have already extracted two values for Type_of_Counsel. Step 5 used append_checklist to add:\n\n1. \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\" from the Complaint document (Page 1, attorney info).\n2. \"Defendant: government counsel\" from the Docket (Event 10, Luke Mathers appearing for All Defendants).\n\nThe current status shows that Type_of_Counsel has 2 values, and the checklist is 1/1 filled. The available documents include some unvisited ones like \"First Amended Complaint\", \"Order (001)\", etc., but the user's prior steps have already processed the Complaint (partially) and Docket (fully).\n\nWait, the Complaint document was partially read (tokens 0-10000 out of 21,685), but the key evidence for Plaintiff's counsel was on Page 1, which was covered in the first 10k tokens. The Docket was fully read. The other documents haven't been checked yet.\n\nBut the system's latest status says \"All checklist items (Type_of_Counsel) are fully extracted with two distinct values\". The user called stop at Step 6, but the system then ran get_checklist and shows 1 key filled with 2 values. Now, the current task is to decide the next action.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to stop only when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, Type_of_Counsel is filled with 2 values. The system's current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", so it's complete. The previous stop attempt (Step 6) was followed by an automatic get_checklist, and now it's asking for the next action.\n\nBut the user's latest snapshot says \"Your decision now: Call `stop` again if satisfied.\" Since all keys are filled and no more values are expected (the two extracted cover Plaintiff and Defendant sides), the correct action is to stop again. The system allows two stop attempts, and this is the second one.\n\nI should check if there's any possible missing value. The Defendant's counsel was listed as \"government counsel\" based on Luke Mathers appearing for \"All Defendants\" (the US government entities). The Plaintiff's counsel is from Tranel Law Firm, a private firm. No other documents have been read that might add more counsel types. The unvisited documents (like the Amended Complaint) probably don't add new counsel info since the attorney info is usually in the initial filings. The Docket and Complaint already covered both sides.\n\nSo, no need for more actions. The correct response is to stop with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Type_of_Counsel) are fully extracted with two distinct values: Plaintiff private counsel (Tranel Law Firm, P.C.) and Defendant government counsel.
