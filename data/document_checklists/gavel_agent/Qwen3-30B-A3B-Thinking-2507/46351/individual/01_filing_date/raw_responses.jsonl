The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data.

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The Docket document is likely to have the filing date since dockets usually list the initial filing date. The Complaint and Amended Complaint might also have it, but the Docket is a good starting point.\n\nThe user has 10 documents, all unvisited. The Docket is smaller (4,974 tokens), so it's efficient to read that first. I should use read_document on the Docket, starting from token 0 to the end since it's unvisited. That way, I can check for the filing date there.\n\nWait, the problem says to use the most likely document. Docket entries often have the filing date as the first entry. So reading the Docket first makes sense. The other documents might have dates, but the Docket is the most probable place. Let's go with read_document on Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4974}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4974}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3413, "completion_tokens": 264, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the Docket document was already read (tokens 0-4974), and in that Docket, the first entry (entry 1) says \"COMPLAINT against Kristi Noem... filed by Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard... (Entered: 04/04/2025)\". So the filing date here is 04/04/2025.\n\nWait, the checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed. The Docket entry mentions \"Entered: 04/04/2025\" for the Complaint. That's likely the filing date. The problem says to extract EVERY distinct value, so I need to check if there are other entries with different dates, but in the Docket, all the entries have dates starting from 04/04/2025. The first one is the Complaint, which is the initial filing. The other entries are subsequent events like motions, which have later dates. So the Filing_Date should be 04/04/2025.\n\nThe current status shows that Filing_Date is empty, and the Docket was fully visited. So the next step is to extract that date. Since the Docket was already read, and the evidence is there, I should use append_checklist to add the value. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text from the Docket is \"COMPLAINT against Kristi Noem, The United States of America, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, filed by Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard. (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit Declaration of Susan Webber, ... (Entered: 04/04/2025)\".\n\nSo the value is \"2025-04-04\" (assuming the format is YYYY-MM-DD as per the date in the Docket). Wait, the Docket shows \"04/04/2025\", which is April 4, 2025. But the checklist might expect a specific format. The problem says \"calendar date\", so probably MM/DD/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD. The example in the Docket uses 04/04/2025, but the extracted value should be consistent. The user's checklist item description doesn't specify the format, but the example in the Docket uses that format. However, the instructions say to use the verbatim text. Wait, no, the extracted value should be the actual date, not the string as written. But the problem says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so the value is the date string as presented. Wait, the Docket says \"Entered: 04/04/2025\", so the date is 04/04/2025. But the checklist item says \"calendar date\", so it's standard to use the date as written. However, the user might expect it in a specific format, but the instructions don't specify. Since the task is to extract from the document, the value should be the exact string found, which is \"04/04/2025\". But wait, the example in the Docket entries have \"Entered: 04/04/2025\", so the date string is \"04/04/2025\".\n\nWait, but the checklist definition says \"calendar date\", so perhaps it's acceptable to have it as 04/04/2025. The key is to extract it as it appears. So the value is \"04/04/2025\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to have the text, source document, and location. The source document is \"Docket\", location is the specific entry. In the Docket, the entry is listed as \"1 | 2025-04-04 | COMPLAINT... (Entered: 04/04/2025)\". Wait, the date in the Docket entry is written as \"2025-04-04\" in the first column, but the \"Entered\" date is \"04/04/2025\". Hmm, the problem says \"Filing Date\" is the date the lawsuit was filed. The first entry (entry 1) is the Complaint, which is the initial filing. The date in the \"Entered\" field is the date it was entered into the docket, which is the filing date. So the date is 04/04/2025.\n\nThe verbatim text for evidence should be the part that says \"Entered: 04/04/2025\". So the text would be \"Entered: 04/04/2025\", source document \"Docket\", location could be \"Docket Entry 1\" or \"Docket, entry 1\".\n\nWait, the Docket is a document, and the entry is part of it. The location could be specified as \"Docket, entry 1\" or perhaps the token range. But since the document was fully read (tokens 0-4974), the location can be the entry number. The problem says \"location\" can be \"page, section, docket entry\". So \"Docket Entry 1\" would be appropriate.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"04/04/2025\", with evidence text \"Entered: 04/04/2025\", source \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 1\".\n\nNow, the checklist key is Filing_Date, and it's currently empty. So I need to append this value. The function to use is append_checklist, since it's adding a new entry. The patch should have the key as \"Filing_Date\" and the extracted list with one entry containing the value and evidence.\n\nThe previous action was reading the Docket, so the next step is to append the extracted value. The user's instructions say that after a read_document, the next action must be append_checklist or update_checklist. Since this is the first value, append_checklist is correct.\n\nCheck if there are other possible dates. Looking through the Docket, the first entry (entry 1) is the Complaint with entered date 04/04/2025. The next entries have dates like 04/04/2025, 04/07/2025, etc., but those are subsequent events. The filing date is the initial filing, which is entry 1. So only one value: 04/04/2025.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call append_checklist with the Filing_Date key and the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"04/04/2025\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Entered: 04/04/2025\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 1\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "04/04/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Entered: 04/04/2025", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket Entry 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8569, "completion_tokens": 1559, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Step 3: append_checklist added Filing_Date with value \"04/04/2025\" from Docket Entry 1.\n\nCurrent status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value, and the Docket document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The other 9 documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). But the checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed. The Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against... filed by Susan Webber... (Entered: 04/04/2025)\". So the filing date is 04/04/2025.\n\nWait, but the user needs to check if there are any other instances of the filing date in other documents. However, the Filing_Date is defined as the date the lawsuit was first filed, which should be the same across all documents. The complaint is the first filing, so the date from the Docket's first entry (Entry 1) is the correct one. The other documents might have later dates, but the filing date is the initial date.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, Entry 1 is the complaint filed on 04/04/2025. The other entries like 15 (Amended Complaint) are on 04/11/2025, which is a later date, not the filing date. So the only correct filing date is 04/04/2025.\n\nThe user's current checklist has Filing_Date with one value. The question is, is there any other document that might have a different filing date? But since the lawsuit was first filed on 04/04/2025, any other document would not have a different filing date. The complaint is the initial filing.\n\nThe available documents include Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc. The Complaint document might have the filing date in its header or cover page. But the Docket already provided the date. However, the system's process says to extract from all documents, so maybe the Complaint document also lists the date. But according to the checklist definition, it's the date the lawsuit was first filed, which is the same as the complaint's filing date.\n\nWait, the user's Step 2 read the Docket, which already captured the date. The Docket is a log of events, and the first entry (Entry 1) is the complaint filing with the date. The other documents like the Complaint itself might not have the filing date again, but the Docket entry is the authoritative source. However, the instructions say to extract from all documents, so maybe the Complaint document also has the date.\n\nBut the Docket is part of the corpus, and it's already fully read. The other documents are unvisited. Let's check if the Complaint document might have the date. For example, the Complaint might have a \"Filed\" date on the cover page. If that's the case, the user should read the Complaint document to confirm.\n\nWait, but the user's current status shows that the Docket is fully visited, and the Filing_Date is already extracted. The problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" However, the filing date should be the same across all documents (the initial date), so there's only one value. But maybe the Complaint document has the same date, so it's redundant. But the instructions say to extract every distinct value, so even if it's the same, it's still one value. Wait, no—distinct values. So if the same date appears in multiple places, it's still one distinct value.\n\nThe user already has the value \"04/04/2025\" from the Docket. The Complaint document might have the same date, but it's not a new distinct value. So the checklist item Filing_Date is already complete with one value.\n\nWait, but the user needs to make sure that there are no other dates. For example, if the Complaint document has a different date, but that's unlikely. The initial filing date is the same as the Docket entry.\n\nThe current checklist summary shows 1/1 keys filled. The user should check if there are any other documents that might have the filing date. But since the lawsuit was first filed on 04/04/2025, the Complaint document's filing date should match. However, the Complaint might not explicitly state the filing date again—it's the Docket that records the date. So the Docket is the primary source here.\n\nThe available documents include the Complaint, which is unvisited. Should the user read the Complaint to confirm? But the Docket already provided the date. The instructions say to extract from all documents, but if the Docket already has the correct date, and the Complaint's date is the same, it's redundant. However, the evidence for Filing_Date is already taken from the Docket. The user's Step 3 appended the value from the Docket.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are any other documents that might have a different filing date. But since the filing date is the first filing, it's unlikely. The user should verify if the Filing_Date is correctly set. The current status shows 1 value, and the key is filled.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So it's the initial date. The Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT ... filed by Susan Webber... (Entered: 04/04/2025)\", so the entered date is the filing date. The Docket's \"Entered\" date is the filing date.\n\nThe user has one value. The other documents (like Complaint, Amended Complaint) might have their own dates, but those are not the filing date of the lawsuit. The filing date is the first time it was filed, which is the complaint. So the other documents are amendments or motions, which have later dates.\n\nTherefore, the Filing_Date should only have one value. The user has already extracted it from the Docket. The other documents don't need to be read because they won't have a different filing date. The system's current state shows all keys are filled (1/1), so the user should stop.\n\nWait, but the user's next action options include 'stop' when all keys are complete. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The user should stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and the user has one value. The other documents are unvisited, but they don't contain the filing date (only the initial filing date). The Complaint document might have the date in the header, but it's the same as the Docket. Since the value is already extracted and it's a single distinct value, there's no need to read other documents.\n\nThe Stop Criteria: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either Complete: all relevant values present... or Not Applicable.\"\n\nHere, the key is complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's current step is Step 4, and they're supposed to extract the filing date. The previous steps have already extracted it. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date is complete with one distinct value (04/04/2025) extracted from Docket Entry 1.

The other documents like Complaint or Amended Complaint might have different dates, but the filing date is the initial date, not amendments.
