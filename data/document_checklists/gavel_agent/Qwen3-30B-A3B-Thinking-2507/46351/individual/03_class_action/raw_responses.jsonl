The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first.

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all 10 documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The key is empty, so I need to find where this information might be. The most likely places would be the Complaints (since they're the initial filings), maybe the Docket, or the Orders.\n\nThe Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and the First Amended Complaint are the primary documents where the plaintiff's status would be stated. The Docket might have a summary, but the Complaints are more likely to have the exact wording.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I should start with the main Complaint. The first document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with 21,685 tokens. But reading the entire document might be too much. However, the instructions say to read a targeted window up to 10k tokens. The first 10k tokens would be a good start.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions already did list_documents, so the catalog is known. The next step should be to read a document. The Complaint is the most relevant. So I should use read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. Then, after reading, check if the class action status is mentioned there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search_document_regex could be used to find keywords like \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\". But the user's instructions say to use read_document as the default. Since the key is empty and the most relevant document is the Complaint, reading the Complaint makes sense.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint, tokens 0-10000. Then, after getting that text, analyze it for the checklist item. If it's there, append the value. If not, maybe check the next document or use regex.\n\nBut according to the decision policy, if a specific document likely contains the target, choose read_document. The Complaint is the most likely, so that's the first step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3463, "completion_tokens": 542, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires specifying whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs, with a brief description if individual.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first document read is the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The user already read tokens 0-10000 of this document. Let me check the text for any mention of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nIn the complaint, I see the plaintiffs are Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard. They are described as enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation and a rancher. The complaint states they are \"enrolled members of the approximately 17,500 member Blackfeet Nation\" and \"enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe.\" The complaint is filed on behalf of themselves and others, but the key part is in paragraph 11 and 12. \n\nParagraph 11 says: \"Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\" Paragraph 12: \"Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation who operates a family place south of Browning. St. Goddard is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe...\"\n\nWait, but the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual. The complaint mentions \"Plaintiffs\" plural (Susan and Jonathan), but they are individual plaintiffs. The complaint doesn't mention a class action. The term \"class action\" isn't used here. The plaintiffs are two individuals, not a class. So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nThe description would be Susan Webber as an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations, and Jonathan St. Goddard as a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation. But the checklist says \"a brief description of the individuals when applicable.\" So the value would be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\".\n\nWait, the exact requirement is: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So the extracted value should be the second form with the description.\n\nNow, checking the document, the complaint is filed by Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard as individuals. There's no mention of a class action. The complaint says \"Plaintiffs\" but they are two individuals, not a class. So the correct value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation, with Susan Webber representing tribal interests and Jonathan St. Goddard as a rancher.\"\n\nBut need to make sure there's no class action mentioned. The document doesn't say \"class action\" anywhere. The plaintiffs are named individuals. So it's individual, not class.\n\nNow, evidence: need to cite the text. The key parts are in paragraphs 11 and 12. The verbatim text would be from those paragraphs. The source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and location is page 5 (since the text shows page 5 in the document). The token range read is 0-10000, so the location can be page numbers or token ranges. The document shows page numbers like \"Page 5 of 38\", so location would be \"Page 5\".\n\nWait, the document's token range was 0-10000, which covered up to page 17, but the relevant text is on page 5. So location is \"Page 5\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (enrolled member of Blackfeet Nation, elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (enrolled member of Blackfeet Tribe, rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\".\n\nNow, since this is the first extraction for this key, need to use append_checklist. The checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value should be a list with one entry. The evidence should include the text snippet, source document, and location.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so the key name is that. The value is the string as per the format.\n\nSo, the extracted entry's value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation, with Susan Webber representing tribal interests and Jonathan St. Goddard as a rancher on tribal lands.\"\n\nBut need to make it concise as per the requirement. The example says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So the description is the part after \"described as\".\n\nFrom paragraph 11: \"enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\"\n\nFrom paragraph 12: \"enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe, with relatives in Canada who are enrolled tribal members... rancher on the Blackfeet Nation who operates a family place south of Browning.\"\n\nSo the description could be: \"Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\".\n\nTherefore, the full value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\".\n\nEvidence text: the exact lines from paragraphs 11 and 12. But since it's a verbatim snippet, need to take the relevant parts. The text shows:\n\n\"11. Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\"\n\n\"12. Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation who operates a family place south of Browning.\"\n\nSo the evidence text would include those two sentences.\n\nSource document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n\nLocation: Page 5 (since the document shows \"Page 5 of 38\" in the header for the text of paragraph 11 and 12).\n\nNow, the next action is to append this value to the checklist. Since the key was empty before, appending this single entry is correct.\n\nSo the function to call is append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted entry.\n\nCheck if the value is correctly formatted. Yes, it's \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\" with the description.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, so no other evidence. The other documents are unvisited, but the complaint already contains the necessary info.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"11.

The user is trying to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". From the recent actions, they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and appended the value where the plaintiffs are individuals: Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard.\n\nNow, checking the current status: they have 1 key filled out, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. The document catalog shows there are 10 documents, but only the Complaint is partially visited (46% covered). The other documents are unvisited. The next step is to figure out if there are more values to extract for the same checklist item.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract EVERY distinct value. The current extraction has one value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber...\". But maybe other documents have more info. For example, the First Amended Complaint might have a different designation. Or maybe the Docket or other pleadings mention class action.\n\nBut the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning they think they have all the values. However, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So maybe they need to check other documents to confirm if there's a class action designation elsewhere. Wait, the Complaint they read describes the plaintiffs as individuals, not a class action. But maybe in the Amended Complaint, they switched to a class action.\n\nLooking at the available documents: the First Amended Complaint is unvisited. So the next logical step is to read that document to see if it changes the class action status. The current document (Complaint) has the plaintiffs as individuals, but the Amended Complaint might be different. Since the user's checklist requires all distinct values, they need to check if the Amended Complaint indicates a class action.\n\nThe user shouldn't assume that the first document is the only one. So the next action should be to read the First Amended Complaint. But the document is 24,920 tokens, so they can't read all at once. They should start with the first 10,000 tokens. The document is marked as unvisited, so they need to use read_document on that.\n\nWait, the current state shows the Complaint is partially visited (0-10000), but the Amended Complaint is unvisited. So the next step is to read the Amended Complaint. The action should be read_document on \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with tokens 0-10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should check if there's a regex pattern that could help find \"class action\" in other documents, but since they're specifically looking for the class action status, and the first document already has the value, checking the Amended Complaint makes sense because that's the next most relevant document.\n\nSo the correct next action is to read the First Amended Complaint from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14220, "completion_tokens": 695, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to format it as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nFrom the recent actions, Step 3 already appended a value from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations) and Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation)\". The evidence comes from pages 5 of the complaint.\n\nStep 4 read the First Amended Complaint. Now, looking at the text provided for the First Amended Complaint, I need to check if there's more information about the class action status. The First Amended Complaint lists additional plaintiffs: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief. The description for Rhonda and David mentions they are enrolled members of the Blackfeet Tribe and their business activities. \n\nWait, the checklist item requires the status to be either \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\" with a description. The current extracted value says \"Individual\" because it's listing specific individuals. But the First Amended Complaint adds two more plaintiffs: Rhonda and David. So, the description should include all four plaintiffs. However, the checklist item's example shows \"Individual, described as [description]\". The existing entry only mentions Susan and Jonathan. The new plaintiffs (Rhonda and David) need to be included in the description.\n\nWait, the current extracted value from Step 3 was for the original complaint, which had Susan and Jonathan. The First Amended Complaint adds Rhonda and David. So, the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" should now include all four. But the format is to have a single entry with all the descriptions. The existing entry is for Individual, so the new entry should append the additional plaintiffs to the same key.\n\nLooking at the First Amended Complaint's Part III, Parties section (starting at page 7), it lists all four plaintiffs. The description for Rhonda is \"enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe... owns and operates Mountain Chief Company\", and David is \"enrolled member... works with Rhonda... descendant of Mountain Chief\".\n\nSo, the existing extracted value has \"Susan Webber... and Jonathan St. Goddard\". The new evidence from the First Amended Complaint adds Rhonda and David. Therefore, the description should now include all four. The correct value would be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative...), Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher...), Rhonda Mountain Chief (enrolled member...), and David Mountain Chief (enrolled member...)\".\n\nBut the task says to create separate entries for each unique value. Wait, no—the requirement is \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" However, the checklist item is a single key, and the value should be the designation. Since the case is proceeding as individual plaintiffs (not a class action), all the values should be under the same key with the combined description.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"A designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable).\" So, if it's individual plaintiffs, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list]\". The \"described as\" part includes all the individuals. So the correct approach is to have one entry for the key, with the description listing all plaintiffs.\n\nThe existing entry from Step 3 only included Susan and Jonathan. The First Amended Complaint adds Rhonda and David. Therefore, the description should now include all four. So, the next step is to append the new information to the existing key.\n\nBut the system says: \"After each append_checklist or update_checklist action: Verify whether all extractable values from the preceding text were included. If you notice missed values, immediately append them as the next action before continuing.\"\n\nSo, the previous Step 3 appended Susan and Jonathan. Now, from the First Amended Complaint, we have Rhonda and David as additional plaintiffs. Therefore, we need to append those to the same key. But wait, the checklist item is a single key, and the value is a single string. However, the extracted field is a list. Wait, no—the requirement says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" Wait, no, the checklist item is one key, and the value for that key is the designation. So the extracted list for that key should have one entry (since it's the same designation across all documents), but the description should include all plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the example in Step 3's append_checklist shows that they added one value with a description of Susan and Jonathan. Now, the First Amended Complaint adds Rhonda and David, so the description needs to be updated to include all four. However, the system's process says that for append_checklist, you add new entries. But since it's the same key and the same type of value (Individual), you shouldn't have multiple entries for the same key. Wait, the system says \"Any checklist item can have multiple values\", but in this case, the value is the same designation. So perhaps the correct action is to update the existing entry with the full list, but the system says for \"update_checklist\" to replace the entire list.\n\nWait, the Not Applicable encoding says to use update_checklist to set Not Applicable. For this case, since it's individual plaintiffs, the value should be a single entry with the full description. The previous append added Susan and Jonathan. Now, to include Rhonda and David, we need to either append them (but that would create a new entry) or update the existing one.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The value here is the designation. If the designation is the same across all documents (Individual), then there's only one value. The description is part of the value. So the correct approach is to have one entry for the key, with the description listing all plaintiffs mentioned in the documents.\n\nSince the original complaint listed two, and the amended complaint added two more, the full description should include all four. Therefore, the existing entry is incomplete. The correct action is to update the checklist entry with the full description, replacing the previous one. So use update_checklist to replace the extracted list with the new value that includes all four plaintiffs.\n\nBut the system's process says that after reading a document, you should append_checklist if you found extractable values. However, the previous entry was for the first complaint. Now, with the amended complaint, we have more plaintiffs to include. So, the correct action is to use update_checklist to replace the existing entry with the full list.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \"append_checklist: add new entries; Do not set Not Applicable via append_checklist.\" \"update_checklist: replace the entire extracted list; use for single-valued items, complete/authoritative sets, corrections, or to set 'Not Applicable'.\"\n\nSince the value is a single value (Individual), but the description has changed (now including more plaintiffs), we need to replace the existing entry with the updated description. So, update_checklist.\n\nThe existing extracted value has two plaintiffs. The new document adds two more. So the new value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative...), Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher...), Rhonda Mountain Chief (enrolled member...), and David Mountain Chief (enrolled member...)\".\n\nSo, the next action should be update_checklist with the new extracted value that includes all four plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the evidence: the First Amended Complaint, page 7-8, lists all four plaintiffs. The evidence for Rhonda is from page 7: \"Plaintiff Rhonda Mountain Chief is an enrolled member...\" and David on page 8: \"David Mountain Chief is an enrolled member...\".\n\nSo, the evidence for the updated value should include the text from both the original complaint (for Susan and Jonathan) and the amended complaint (for Rhonda and David). Wait, but the system says each extracted entry must have evidence. The existing entry from Step 3 already has evidence for Susan and Jonathan. Now, to include Rhonda and David, the new entry should have the full description with all four, and the evidence would be the relevant text from both documents.\n\nBut the update_checklist replaces the entire extracted list. So, the new extracted list for the key would have one entry, which is the full description, with evidence from both documents.\n\nWait, the evidence for the value should include the text from the documents where the information was found. So, the evidence would have multiple entries (from both the Complaint and the First Amended Complaint) for the same value.\n\nSo, the new extracted value's evidence should include:\n\n- For Susan: from Complaint page 5\n- For Jonathan: from Complaint page 5\n- For Rhonda: from First Amended Complaint page 7\n- For David: from First Amended Complaint page 8\n\nBut the checklist item's value is a single string. So, the evidence array would contain all these snippets.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist to replace the existing entry with the new, complete value and evidence.\n\nThe existing extracted value from Step 3 was one entry with Susan and Jonathan. Now, we need to replace it with a new entry that includes all four, so update_checklist is the right call.\n\nSo, the next action should be update_checklist with the patch containing the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" and the extracted list with the new value and evidence including all four plaintiffs.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations), Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation), Rhonda Mountain Chief (enrolled member of Blackfeet Tribe operating Mountain Chief Company), and David Mountain Chief (enrolled member of Blackfeet Tribe working with Rhonda Mountain Chief)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation who operates a family place south of Browning.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiff Rhonda Mountain Chief is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe and lives on the Blackfeet Nation, and owns and operates the Mountain Chief Company, registered with the Blackfeet Nation, that delivers shuttle services across the Chief Mountain border crossing\",\n                \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 7\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"David Mountain Chief is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe and lives on the Blackfeet Nation, and works with Rhonda Mountain Chief at Mountain Chief Cab Company.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 8\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber (elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations), Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher on Blackfeet Nation), Rhonda Mountain Chief (enrolled member of Blackfeet Tribe operating Mountain Chief Company), and David Mountain Chief (enrolled member of Blackfeet Tribe working with Rhonda Mountain Chief)", "evidence": [{"text": "Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 5"}, {"text": "Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation who operates a family place south of Browning.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 5"}, {"text": "Plaintiff Rhonda Mountain Chief is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe and lives on the Blackfeet Nation, and owns and operates the Mountain Chief Company, registered with the Blackfeet Nation, that delivers shuttle services across the Chief Mountain border crossing", "source_document": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 7"}, {"text": "David Mountain Chief is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe and lives on the Blackfeet Nation, and works with Rhonda Mountain Chief at Mountain Chief Cab Company.", "source_document": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 8"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24789, "completion_tokens": 2553, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents, specifically the checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions:\n- Step 1: Listed documents (found 10 documents)\n- Step 2: Read the first 10k tokens of \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (tokens 0-10000)\n- Step 3: Used append_checklist to add the initial values (Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard)\n- Step 4: Read the first 10k tokens of \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (tokens 0-10000)\n- Step 5: Used update_checklist to replace the previous value with the expanded list including Rhonda Mountain Chief and David Mountain Chief\n\nCurrent status shows:\n- Only one checklist key: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\n- It has 1 value (but the update added 4 plaintiffs)\n- Documents partially visited: Complaint (46% coverage) and First Amended Complaint (40% coverage)\n- Other 8 documents unvisited\n\nThe checklist item requires \"EVERY distinct value\" found in any document. The current extraction has:\n- Susan Webber (elected rep)\n- Jonathan St. Goddard (rancher)\n- Rhonda Mountain Chief (owns Mountain Chief Company)\n- David Mountain Chief (works with Rhonda)\n\nBut I need to check if there are more plaintiffs mentioned in other documents. The current extraction only covers the first 10k tokens of the two complaints. The Complaint document has 21,685 tokens (46% covered), and the First Amended Complaint has 24,920 tokens (40% covered). There might be more plaintiff names in the remaining unvisited portions.\n\nHowever, the current extraction already includes all plaintiffs mentioned in the first 10k tokens of both complaints. The \"First Amended Complaint\" (Step 4) explicitly lists all four plaintiffs in paragraphs 11-14. The initial complaint (Step 2) only listed two, and the amended version added the other two.\n\nNow, I should consider if there are additional plaintiffs in other documents. The other documents are:\n- Docket (unvisited)\n- Orders (unvisited)\n- Motions/Briefs (unvisited)\n\nBut the checklist item is specifically about the plaintiffs' designation. The Docket might list the parties, but the complaint documents are the primary source for plaintiff identification. The current extraction from the two complaint documents already captures all named plaintiffs (Susan, Jonathan, Rhonda, David).\n\nI should verify if there's any other document that might mention additional plaintiffs. The \"Appellant's Motion\" or \"Briefs\" might reference the case, but they're unlikely to list new plaintiffs since the parties are established in the complaint.\n\nThe current extracted value already includes all four plaintiffs from the amended complaint. The \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" value is correctly formatted as \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list]\".\n\nSince the checklist item only requires the plaintiff designation (which is individual, not class action), and we've captured all named plaintiffs, there are no more values to extract. The value is already complete.\n\nAlso, checking the \"Not Applicable\" criteria: this isn't applicable since we have clear individual plaintiffs.\n\nTherefore, all values have been extracted from the relevant documents. The remaining documents (Docket, Orders, Motions) don't contain additional plaintiff information for this checklist item.\n\nThe current checklist status shows \"Keys with Values\": 1/1, \"Empty Keys\": 0/1, so it's complete.\n\nI should stop now since all required values are extracted and there's no indication of more plaintiffs in other documents.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All plaintiffs identified in both complaints (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief) are captured in the updated checklist value.

The extracted value includes all the plaintiffs mentioned in both the Complaint and the First Amended Complaint. The evidence from both documents supports that the plaintiffs are individuals (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief), not a class action. The system says the checklist is 1/1 filled, with no empty keys or Not Applicable.\n\nThe available documents include some unvisited ones like the Docket, Orders, and Motions. But the user's prior steps already covered the Complaint and First Amended Complaint, which contain all the plaintiff names. The other documents (Docket, Orders, Motions) are unlikely to add more plaintiff information since the plaintiffs are clearly identified in the complaints. The system's automatic review after the first stop says the checklist is complete.\n\nThe user's step 6 was a stop, but the system prompted for a second stop attempt. The current status shows all keys are filled, so they should stop again. The evidence from the two complaints covers all plaintiffs, and no other documents are likely to have additional plaintiff names.
