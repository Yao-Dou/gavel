The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why there are no documents. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to see what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the right function to use here. It will return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct first step is definitely `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3111, "completion_tokens": 257, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which requires the format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status, all 10 documents are unvisited. The task is to find any mentions of appeals. Since there's no prior reading, the next logical step is to start reading documents. But which one?\n\nThe documents listed include Complaints, Dockets, Orders, and Motions/Briefs. Appeals are often mentioned in motions, briefs, or docket entries. The Docket might have a list of appeals, but maybe the motions or briefs have more specific details.\n\nThe Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule probably mentions the appeal directly. The name \"Appellant's Motion\" suggests it's related to an appeal. So maybe that's the best place to start. The document is called \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" and it's 853 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading it entirely would be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the Docket might list the appeal. But since the Docket is a separate document, maybe it's better to check the motion first because it's named for the appeal. The other documents like Complaints might not mention appeals, as they're initial filings. Orders might have rulings, but the appeal process usually comes after the trial court's decision.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Appellant's Motion document. Since it's unvisited, using read_document on that file. Start from token 0 to end. The document is 853 tokens, so start_token 0, end_token 853. That's within the 10k limit.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" as unvisited. So reading that first makes sense. Let's call read_document with that doc name and the full token range.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 853}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 853}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3433, "completion_tokens": 463, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting information about any appeals taken, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they already read the \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" document. The text they read includes the case details. Let me check that.\n\nIn the document, it says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the plaintiffs are Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief. The case number is 25-2717. The motion mentions they're appealing from the district court's denial of their motion for reconsideration. So the appeal is to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe required format is 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So the parties are the plaintiffs listed: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief. The court is the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nI need to make sure the extracted value matches the format. The text says \"Plaintiffs\" but in the appeal context, they are the appellants. The motion is from the appellants, so the parties should be listed as the appellants. The document refers to them as \"Appellants\" in the motion title.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nNow, evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The relevant part is on page 1 of the document, where the court and parties are listed. The location can be \"Page 1 of 3\" as per the document's header.\n\nCheck if there are other documents to read. The current status shows that \"Appellant's Motion...\" is fully visited, but other documents are unvisited. However, since the checklist item is about appeals, and the motion itself is an appeal document, it's likely the main source for this info. The other documents might not have the appeal info, but the user needs to extract all distinct values. But since the motion already provides the appeal details, and the other documents are unvisited, maybe this is the only one needed. But wait, the task says \"extract every distinct value,\" so if there's only one appeal, that's it.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Appeal,\" so they need to extract all instances of appeals. The motion mentions the appeal to the Ninth Circuit, so that's the only one so far. The other documents might have more, but since the user hasn't read them yet, but the current action is to process the text they just read.\n\nThe recent action was a read_document on that motion, so now they should use append_checklist to add the extracted value.\n\nThe checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty, so they need to add this entry. The value should be formatted correctly. Let me check the exact wording from the document.\n\nThe document says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the parties are listed as \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief\" as Plaintiffs, but in the appeal context, they're the appellants. The motion is \"APPELLANT’S MOTION,\" so the parties are appellants.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nWait, the example format says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So the full string should start with \"Appeal: \" followed by the parties and court.\n\nSo the value is \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut the document says \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\" so that's the court name.\n\nNow, evidence: the verbatim text would be the line where the court is mentioned. The header says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the parties are listed above. The location is Page 1 of 3.\n\nSo the evidence should include the text snippet, source document name, and location.\n\nThe document name is \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\", location is \"Page 1 of 3\", and the text is the court name line.\n\nWait, the exact line is \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the parties listed. So the relevant part for the court is that line.\n\nSo the evidence text would be \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" from the document.\n\nBut the value needs to be formatted as per the checklist. So the extracted value is the full sentence as specified.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist should add this entry with the value formatted correctly, and the evidence as the court name line and the parties' names from the document.\n\nWait, the parties are listed in the case caption: \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief\" as Plaintiffs. But in the appeal, they are the appellants. So the parties for the appeal are those names.\n\nSo the value is \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nEvidence text: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief\" from the document.\n\nLocation: Page 1 of 3.\n\nSource document: \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\".\n\nSo the evidence array should have two entries? Wait, no. The evidence for the extracted value should be the verbatim text that supports it. The court name line and the parties' names together support the value. But the checklist says \"verbatim snippet\", so maybe the key part is the court name line, but the parties are in the caption.\n\nWait, the document's case caption lists the parties and the court. So the relevant text is \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief\" as Plaintiffs.\n\nBut the value is a single string. So the evidence should include the text that shows both the parties and the court.\n\nSo the evidence text would be the entire case caption line. Let me check the document:\n\n\"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT \n\nSusan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain   \nChief and David Mountain Chief,  No. 25-2717 \n\nPlaintiffs,   \"\n\nSo the parties are listed as \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief and David Mountain Chief\" and the court is the Ninth Circuit.\n\nTherefore, the evidence text should be \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the parties' names. But the evidence is a verbatim snippet, so probably the line where the court is stated.\n\nBut the example in the problem says \"verbatim snippet\", so the exact text from the document that supports the extracted value.\n\nSo the court name is in the header, and the parties are in the caption. So the evidence can include the court line and the parties' line.\n\nBut the evidence field requires a text, source, and location. So for this entry, the text would be the court line, and the location is Page 1 of 3.\n\nWait, the document's header says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" on page 1. The parties are listed right after. So the relevant text is that court line.\n\nSo the evidence text is \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\".\n\nLocation: Page 1 of 3.\n\nSource: \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\".\n\nThen the value is the formatted string.\n\nSo the extracted entry should have value as the formatted string, and evidence with that text.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist action should add this entry.\n\nSince the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty, this is the first value to add.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the patch containing the key \"Appeal\" and the extracted list with one entry.\n\nThe extracted entry's value is \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nWait, the parties are listed as \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief\" in the document. The \"and\" before the last name is included. So in the value, it should be the same.\n\nThe court is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\".\n\nSo the value string is correct.\n\nNow, check if there are other possible entries. But this is the only document read so far, and it's the only one that mentions the appeal. Other documents are unvisited, but the user should process the current text before moving on. Since the task is to extract from all documents, but the next step after reading a document is to process the extracted values. So after reading the motion, they should append the value they found.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to call append_checklist with the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, and David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT", "source_document": "Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4398, "completion_tokens": 2265, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting checklist items related to appeals from legal documents. The current task is to extract all distinct values for the \"Appeal\" item.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've already done a `list_documents` to find 10 documents, then read the first document (Appellant's Motion) which gave them one entry for Appeal. They used `append_checklist` to add that entry. Now, the status shows 1 out of 1 key has a value, and the rest are empty or not applicable. But wait, there are 9 other documents that haven't been visited yet. The checklist item \"Appeal\" might have more entries in other documents.\n\nThe current state says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", but the user needs to check if there are more appeals in other documents. The available documents list shows 9 unvisited documents, including Complaints, Orders, and Briefs. Since the checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value, they need to check the remaining documents.\n\nThe next step should be to read another document to find more appeal information. The most likely candidates would be the Complaints or other Briefs, as they might mention the appeal. The Docket might also have relevant info. But since the first document was a Motion for Expedited Briefing, which mentioned the appeal, other documents like the Complaint or Briefs could have more details.\n\nThey shouldn't use `list_documents` again because they already have the catalog. `get_checklist` isn't needed since they already know the status. `append_checklist` or `update_checklist` would be for adding values, but they need to read a document first. So the correct action is to use `read_document` on one of the unvisited documents. The next logical step is to pick a document that's likely to contain appeal information. The \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" might have the initial filing details, which could reference the appeal. Alternatively, the \"Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\" might mention the appeal context.\n\nBut since the first document already has the appeal court mentioned, maybe the Complaint would have the parties involved. The document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is 21k tokens, so it's large, but they can read a portion. However, the policy says to read only unvisited tokens. Since it's unvisited (○ Unvisited), they need to start reading from 0. The maximum allowed is 10k tokens, so reading 0-10000 would be safe.\n\nWait, the system says \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" but this one is unvisited. So the next action should be `read_document` on the Complaint. But maybe the Docket or other Orders might have the appeal details. However, the first document (the Motion) already mentions the case number 25-2717, so the Docket might have the appeal information. But the Complaint is the initial filing, which might not mention the appeal yet—it's probably the district court case. The appeal would be from the district court to the appellate court, so the Complaint is likely from the district court, and the Motion is part of the appellate process. So the Complaint might not have the appellate court info, but the Motion does. The other documents like the Orders might have the appellate court's decisions.\n\nWait, the case number 25-2717 is the appellate case number. The Complaint would be in the district court, so the appellate court wouldn't be mentioned there. The Motion for Expedited Briefing is already part of the appellate case, so the appeal is already established. The other documents might have additional appeals or different appeals, but the checklist is about this specific case. Wait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there's only one appeal in the corpus, then they're done. But they need to check all documents to confirm.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning one key (Appeal) has one value. But the checklist might have multiple appeals in different documents. However, in this case, it's one case, so probably only one appeal. But the user needs to make sure there's no other appeal mentioned in other documents. For example, maybe the \"Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene\" mentions another appeal, but that's unlikely. The Orders might reference the appeal.\n\nBut given the information, the safest next step is to read the Docket document, as it often lists case progression, including appeals. The Docket is 4974 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is possible. Alternatively, the \"Order (001)\" might have the appeal details. But the first document they read already has the appellate court mentioned, so maybe the Docket would confirm or add more.\n\nWait, the problem is to extract every distinct value. Since they have one value from the Motion, they need to check if any other document has a different or additional appeal. But in this case, it's a single case, so probably only one appeal. However, the user must check all documents to be sure. So the next step is to read another document. The Docket is a good candidate because it's a summary of the case, including the appellate court.\n\nThe available documents include \"Docket\" [Docket] - 4974 tokens - ○ Unvisited. So reading the entire Docket (0-4974) would be the next step. The Docket might list the case as being appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which would confirm the existing value or provide more context. But since the existing value is already from the Motion, which is part of the appellate case, the Docket might not add new information. However, to be thorough, they should check it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint mentions the appeal, but it's more likely the Complaint is the district court filing, so the appeal isn't mentioned there. The Orders might be the district court orders, so again, not the appellate court.\n\nWait, the case number 25-2717 is the appellate case number. The Complaint would have a different case number (district court). So the Complaint might not reference the appellate court. The Motion they read is part of the appellate case, so the Docket for the appellate case would have the appeal info.\n\nSo, reading the Docket document (tokens 0-4974) is a good next step. If it contains the same appeal information, then they can confirm, but if it has more details or another appeal, they'd need to extract it. But since it's the same case, probably the same appeal. However, they need to check all documents.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be `read_document` on the Docket document, reading the entire 4974 tokens (since it's unvisited). The start_token is 0, end_token is 4974.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4974}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4974}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4531, "completion_tokens": 1527, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that one value has already been extracted from the Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. The checklist item requires the format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the documents, the Docket has been fully read (tokens 0-4974), but the only new relevant info there is Docket entry 41: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" which mentions the case number 25-2717. However, the actual appeal details like the parties and court are already covered in the Motion document. The Motion explicitly states the parties and the Ninth Circuit, so the existing entry is correct.\n\nNow, checking the other documents. The available documents include Complaints, Orders, and Briefs. The next logical step is to check if any other documents might have additional appeal information. But the \"Appeal\" item is about the appeal itself, so documents like the Complaint or Orders might not contain new appeal details. The Motion already captured the appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 51 says \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" which confirms the appeal is to the U.S. Court of Appeals, but the court name is already in the Motion as \"Ninth Circuit\". The Motion's header says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\", so the existing entry is accurate. The Docket's notice of appeal (entry 41) doesn't add new parties or court details beyond what's in the Motion.\n\nThe other documents (Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc.) are pre-appeal documents. The Complaint (entry 1) is the initial filing, and the Orders (like entry 40) are about transferring the case to the Court of International Trade, which was denied. The appeal happened after the transfer was denied, so the appeal details are in the Motion.\n\nSince the Motion already provided the full appeal info, and the Docket doesn't add anything new, there's no need to read more documents. The current extraction has one entry, which is correct. The checklist requires all distinct values. Is there any other appeal mentioned elsewhere? The Docket entries 52-58 are about the appeal process but don't add new parties or courts. For example, entry 52 is an Order from USCA, but it doesn't specify new parties or court.\n\nSo, all relevant appeal info is already extracted. The next step is to confirm that there are no more entries. The user's goal is to extract every distinct value. Since the existing entry covers the only appeal mentioned (parties and Ninth Circuit), and no other documents have additional appeal details, the checklist is complete.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The existing entry is the only one. The Docket's notice of appeal (41) mentions \"Notice of Appeal\" but the actual parties and court are already in the Motion. So no new value.\n\nTherefore, the checklist is complete. The next action should be to stop, as all keys are filled (Appeal has one value, no empty or Not Applicable needed).\n\nCheck the stop criteria: all keys are complete. The Appeal key has one value, which is correctly extracted. No other documents need to be checked because the Docket was fully visited and didn't add anything new. The other documents are unvisited, but they're pre-appeal (like Complaints), so they wouldn't have appeal info.
