The user is trying to extract related cases from legal documents, but the current status shows no documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is empty, and there are zero documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next move is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and currently, it's empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain case numbers. The Docket document usually lists related cases, so that's a good candidate. The Docket is marked as unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I should read it first. The Docket has 4,974 tokens, which is under the 10,000 limit, so reading the whole thing is possible.\n\nWait, the task says to use read_document for a targeted window. Since the Docket is a document that typically lists related cases, reading the entire document makes sense here. The other documents like Complaints might mention related cases, but the Docket is the most probable place. Let me check the document names again: Docket [Docket] - 4,974 tokens. Yeah, that's the right one.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The parameters for read_document need doc_name, start_token, and end_token. Since it's unvisited, start_token is 0 and end_token is the full token count, which is 4,974. So I'll set start_token to 0 and end_token to 4974.\n\nWait, the document says \"Viewed tokens: X-Y\" but since it's unvisited, there's no previous viewing. So reading from 0 to 4974 tokens should cover the whole document. Let me make sure the token count is correct. The Docket is listed as 4,974 tokens, so end_token should be 4974.\n\nNo need for regex here because the Docket is a structured document where related cases are likely listed in a section. Using read_document on the entire Docket is the most straightforward next step. After reading it, I can look for case numbers like \"Case No. 12345\" or similar patterns. Then, if I find any, I'll use append_checklist to add them with evidence.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on the Docket document with start_token 0 and end_token 4974.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4974}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4974}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3426, "completion_tokens": 535, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents. So far, they've read the Docket document, which is fully visited (tokens 0-4974), but the Docket doesn't seem to have any related cases listed by case codes. The Docket entries mention case numbers like \"Doc. 18\" or \"Doc. 40\", but those are internal docket numbers, not case codes of related cases.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is the only one that's fully visited. The other documents are unvisited (marked with ○). The checklist item is about related cases identified by their case numbers or codes. The Docket might not have the actual case codes; maybe the Complaint or other documents do.\n\nWait, the Docket entries like \"Doc. 18\" refer to the document number within the docket, not the case code. For example, \"MOTION to Transfer to U.S. Court of International Trade. Luke Mathers appearing for Defendants... (Doc. 18)\" – here, Doc. 18 is the docket entry number, not the case code. So the actual related cases' case codes might be in other documents, like the Complaint or the Orders.\n\nThe user needs to check other documents. The next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain related case numbers. The \"Order (001)\" and \"Order (002)\" might have case references. But the most promising might be the \"Complaint\" or \"First Amended Complaint\" since they often list related cases.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". So the related cases should have their own case numbers. For example, if there's a case like \"Case No. 25-2717\" mentioned, that's a related case. Looking at the Docket, in entry 51: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal...\". So USCA Case Number 25-2717 is a related case. But is that a case code? Yes, USCA Case Number is a case code. So that's a value to extract.\n\nWait, entry 51 says \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\". So the case code here is 25-2717. But the Docket entry mentions it as part of the notice of appeal. So the related case code is 25-2717. But the Docket is already fully read, so we can extract that from there.\n\nWait, the Docket was read (tokens 0-4974), and in entry 51, it says \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\". So that's a related case listed by its case code. So that's a value for the checklist item. The user needs to extract that.\n\nSo the extracted value would be \"25-2717\" with evidence from Docket entry 51. But the Docket is fully visited, so the text is already available. The user should use append_checklist to add this entry.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", meaning no values extracted yet. So even though the Docket has the case number, they haven't processed it yet. So the next action should be to append that value to the checklist.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The value is \"25-2717\", evidence from Docket entry 51.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with that value. But let me confirm. The Docket entry 51: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal...\". So \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" is the related case code. So the value is \"25-2717\".\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to append that to the checklist. The document is Docket, location is entry 51 (or token range where that's found), but since the Docket was read in full, the location can be specified as \"Docket Entry 51\" or similar.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", extracted list with one entry: value \"25-2717\", evidence including the text snippet from entry 51.\n\nWait, the user needs to make sure it's the case code. \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" – the case code here is 25-2717.

The task is to extract the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents. So far, they've already found one value from the Docket document: \"25-2717\" from Docket Entry 51.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have 1 value extracted, but the checklist item might have more. The documents listed include other files like Complaints, Orders, and Briefs. The Docket is fully visited, so no more to read there. The other documents are unvisited, so I need to check if any of them contain related case numbers.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents for possible related case numbers. The key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which refers to case codes. In legal documents, case numbers often appear as \"USCA Case Number\" or similar. The Docket had \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\", so maybe other documents have similar references.\n\nI should look for patterns like \"USCA Case Number\", \"Case No.\", or other case identifiers. The search_document_regex tool would be good here to scan all unvisited documents for such patterns. The regex should target case numbers, maybe something like \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\" or similar. But since the example was \"25-2717\", the pattern might be two digits, hyphen, four digits.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"25-2717\", so the regex should look for that pattern. Let me think of a regex pattern that matches case numbers like \"25-2717\". It's likely \"(\\d{2}-\\d{4})\" but maybe with more context. But the tool allows using a regex pattern. So, using a regex to search for \"USCA Case Number\" followed by a case number pattern.\n\nThe available documents are all unvisited except Docket. So, using search_document_regex on all unvisited documents with pattern \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\" would be efficient. Alternatively, since the Docket already had that, maybe other documents have different case numbers, like \"Case No.\" or \"Circuit Case Number\".\n\nBut the checklist says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\", so it's not limited to USCA. So the regex should be broader. Maybe \"Case Number|USCA Case Number|Case No.\\s*\\d{2}-\\d{4}\" but need to make sure it's precise.\n\nWait, the previous extraction found \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\", so the pattern could be \"USCA Case Number\\s*(\\d{2}-\\d{4})\". But to cover other possibilities, maybe use a more general regex like \"Case Number\\s*[\\d-]+\".\n\nBut the tool's instructions say to use precise, anchored patterns tied to document structure. So maybe better to search for \"USCA Case Number\" as it's specific to the example. Also, the other documents might have similar entries. For example, the \"Appellant's Motion\" or \"Brief\" documents might reference the case number.\n\nSo, the best action now is to use search_document_regex with pattern \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\" across all unvisited documents. That way, we can find any similar entries without reading the entire documents.\n\nCheck the available documents: there are 9 unvisited documents. Using search_document_regex with doc_name='all' would search all of them. The parameters would be pattern \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\", and maybe context tokens to get the surrounding text.\n\nWait, the pattern needs to be a regex. So the pattern could be \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\". The \\d{2}-\\d{4} matches two digits, a hyphen, four digits. The example was 25-2717, so that's two digits, hyphen, four digits. So the regex pattern should be \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\".\n\nUsing search_document_regex with that pattern on all documents (doc_name='all') would find all instances. Then, for each match, the tool returns the context, and we can then append the extracted values.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\" and doc_name='all'. That's the most efficient way to find any other related case numbers without reading each document fully.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"USCA Case Number \\\\d{2}-\\\\d{4}\", \"doc_name\": \"all\"}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}", "doc_name": "all"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8733, "completion_tokens": 1021, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

They used `search_document_regex` with the pattern \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\" and found a match in Docket entry 51. That's the only value they have so far.\n\nLooking at the current status, there's 1 key with 1 value. The documents available include several unvisited ones like Complaint, Amended Complaint, various Orders, and Briefs. The Docket is fully visited, so they can't read it again.\n\nThe next step should be to check if there are more related cases in other documents. Since the Docket was fully read and they found one case number, they should look at other documents that might mention related cases. The regex search was done on all documents, but maybe other documents have different case numbers. Wait, the regex search was done on all documents and only found one match. But maybe there are other patterns or different case numbers not matching that regex.\n\nWait, the regex used was \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\", which matches \"25-2717\". But maybe other related cases are listed with different formats, like \"Case No.\" or \"C.A. No.\" or something else. However, the checklist specifies \"case code number\", so maybe they need to look for other patterns. But the user's step 4 used a regex that found the one entry.\n\nWait, the current status shows that the Docket is fully visited, and the other documents are unvisited. The user should probably read some of the unvisited documents to see if they contain other case numbers. For example, the Amended Complaint, the Orders, or the Briefs might reference other cases.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"First Amended Complaint\" might have related cases listed. Similarly, the \"Brief in Support of Motion...\" could mention other cases. Since the regex search only found one entry, but the checklist says to extract every distinct value, they need to check other documents.\n\nThe next action should be to read one of the unvisited documents. The most likely candidates are the Complaints or the Briefs, as they might have references to related cases. The \"Order (001)\" might also have case numbers.\n\nBut the user should pick a document that's most likely to contain related case numbers. The Amended Complaint (First Amended Complaint) is probably a good candidate because complaints often cite related cases. Let's check the document names: \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" [Complaint] - 24,920 tokens. It's a complaint, so it might list related cases.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read that document. But the user needs to choose a token range. Since it's unvisited, they should read the entire document or a large part. However, the maximum per read is 10,000 tokens. The document has 24,920 tokens, so they need to read it in chunks. But the first chunk would be tokens 0-10,000.\n\nWait, the tool says to read a targeted window ≤10,000 tokens. So, the next step is to call `read_document` on \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" from tokens 0-10,000.\n\nWait, but the user might want to check if there's a specific section. However, without prior knowledge, starting from the beginning makes sense.

So the related cases would be other cases that are connected, like the appeal case. The Docket entry 51 mentions \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\", which is the Ninth Circuit case number. That's a related case to the current one (4:25-cv-00026-DLC). So they have that one.\n\nAre there any other related cases mentioned in the documents? The Docket was fully read, and they found that one. The complaint was partially read, but the text provided doesn't show other case numbers. The other documents are unvisited, but the regex search was done on all documents and only found that one match. So maybe there's only one related case.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure. Since the complaint is partially visited, maybe they should read more of it to check for other case numbers. However, the regex search already covered all documents, and the only match was in the Docket. So perhaps there are no more.\n\nWait, the regex pattern was \"USCA Case Number \\d{2}-\\d{4}\", which matches \"25-2717\". The Docket had that, and the regex search found it. The complaint might have other case numbers, but the regex might not have caught them if they don't match the pattern. For example, maybe the complaint mentions \"Case No. 4:25-cv-00026-DLC\" but that's the current case, not a related one. The related case is the appellate one.\n\nThe user has already appended the value from the Docket. The checklist item now has one value. The status shows 1/1 keys with values, so all keys are filled.
