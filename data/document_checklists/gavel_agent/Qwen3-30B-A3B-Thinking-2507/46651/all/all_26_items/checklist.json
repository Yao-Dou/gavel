On April 23, 2025, all pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements except for three were abruptly canceled.\n19. On April 25, 2025, DOL released a \u201cJob Corps Transparency Report,\u201d which applies a flawed methodology and reflects selective and inaccurate performance measures, costs, and statistics.\n20. On April 30, 2025, DOL effectively terminated its provision of internet service to Job Corps campuses.\n21. On May 2, 2025, Russell T.
