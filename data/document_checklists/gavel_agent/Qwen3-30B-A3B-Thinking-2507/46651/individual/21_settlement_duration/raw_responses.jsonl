The user hasn't provided any documents, so the next logical step is to list them. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents exist.

The task is to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the documents. The user has provided 5 documents, all unvisited. The checklist item requires the duration of settlement obligations, excluding those incorporated into court orders.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where to look. Settlement durations are usually in the complaint or the order documents. The Complaints (001 and 002) might mention settlement terms, but often complaints are the initial filing without settlement details. The Docket could have entries related to settlement, but docket entries are more procedural. The \"Opinion and Order\" and the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" might have settlement terms if they include such clauses.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if the settlement is part of an order, it shouldn't be included. But the Order documents might have the settlement terms if they're part of the order. Hmm. The user specified to exclude those in court orders, so maybe the settlement terms are in the Complaints or other documents like a settlement agreement, but the available documents don't list a settlement agreement. The documents are Complaint, Docket, Opinion & Order, and another Order.\n\nWait, the available documents are Complaint (two), Docket, Opinion and Order, and another Order. The \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" is very short (81 tokens), so probably not relevant. The Docket might have a settlement entry. Maybe the \"Opinion and Order\" includes a settlement, but the user says to exclude court orders. So perhaps the settlement terms are in the Complaints, but complaints usually don't have settlement terms; they're the plaintiff's claims. Settlements are usually after the case starts, so maybe in the Docket or a separate settlement agreement. But the documents listed don't include a settlement agreement. Hmm.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders.\" So if the settlement is part of a court order, it's excluded. So I need to look for documents that are settlements not part of the court order. But the available documents don't have a separate settlement document. Maybe the Complaint mentions a proposed settlement? Or the Docket has a settlement entry.\n\nThe Docket (17k tokens) is likely to have entries about settlement. For example, a docket entry might state \"Settlement reached, parties to submit agreement.\" But the actual duration would be in the settlement agreement, which isn't listed. Wait, the documents provided are the ones the user has, so maybe the settlement terms are in the Complaints. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Opinion and Order\" might include a settlement. But the user says to exclude court orders, so if the settlement is part of the order, it's excluded. So maybe the settlement duration isn't in the provided documents. But the user says to extract all values found, so if none are found, set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut first, I need to check the documents. Since all are unvisited, the next step is to read a document. Which one? The Docket is the largest (17k tokens), but maybe the settlement is mentioned there. Alternatively, the Complaints might have a settlement clause. Wait, Complaints are filed by the plaintiff, so they usually don't have settlement terms; settlements are negotiated later. So the Complaints probably don't have settlement durations. The Docket is more likely to have entries about settlements.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Docket document. Let's use read_document on the Docket. Since it's unvisited, start from token 0 to 10,000. The Docket is 17k tokens, so reading the first 10k tokens is safe. That should cover the main entries. If the settlement terms are in the Docket, we might find them. If not, we can try other documents.\n\nWait, the checklist item requires the duration as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So looking for phrases like \"settlement period of 2 years\" or \"obligations to continue for 5 years\". So maybe in the Docket, there's a line like \"Settlement agreement requires monitoring for 3 years.\" But need to check.\n\nSo the next step is to read the Docket document from start to 10,000 tokens. That's the most promising document to find settlement terms. If nothing is found there, then check the other documents, but Docket is the best bet.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3314, "completion_tokens": 1008, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The Docket document was partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the checklist shows 0 values extracted. The available documents include Docket (partially visited), Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and another Order/Opinion. The Docket has been read up to 10k tokens, but the user mentioned it's only 58% covered (17,264 tokens total), so there might be more to read.\n\nLooking at the Docket's content, the key documents are the Complaint (entry 19), the TRO Order (entry 23), and subsequent entries. The TRO Order (entry 23) says \"ORDERED that Defendants... are ENJOINED from... eliminating the Job Corps program... until June 17, 2025.\" Wait, but the TRO is extended to June 25, 2025 in entry 54. However, the TRO is a court order, not a settlement. The checklist specifies that settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order should be included. So the TRO and extensions are court orders, not settlements. Therefore, they shouldn't count for the settlement duration.\n\nThe user's task is to find settlement durations, not court orders. So the Docket entries don't mention any settlement terms. The Complaints (entries 19, 22, etc.) are about the lawsuit, but no settlement details. The other documents like the Motion for TRO, Memoranda, and Declarations are all part of the litigation, not settlement agreements.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The Docket was partially read, but the remaining tokens (10000-17264) might have more info. However, the Docket is a log of court entries, so it's unlikely to contain settlement terms. The other documents are Complaints, Orders, and Opinions. The \"Opinion and Order\" and \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" are court orders, so they might not have settlement terms. But maybe the \"Opinion and Order\" has a settlement agreement? Wait, the Order Granting TRO is a court order, so it's not a settlement. The Complaints (001 and 002) might be the initial filings, but they're likely the lawsuit, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order.\" So if there's a settlement agreement that's not part of a court order, it should be extracted. But in the Docket, all the documents are court-related. The TRO is a court order, the Complaint is the lawsuit. The \"Joint Status Report\" (entry 55) mentions redactions but doesn't discuss settlement. The \"Order\" entries are all court orders.\n\nSo maybe there's no settlement mentioned in the documents. The checklist item might be \"Not Applicable.\" But according to the policy, we can't mark it as Not Applicable just because we haven't found it; we need explicit evidence. However, the documents provided don't mention any settlement terms. The case is about a TRO and preliminary injunction, not a settlement. The case is ongoing (hearing on 6/17, extensions), so there's no settlement yet.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to set the key to Not Applicable. But to do that, we need to use update_checklist with the value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence should be a statement that there's no settlement mentioned in the documents, or that the case is still ongoing without a settlement.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last. Since the documents don't contain any settlement terms (only court orders and litigation), we can conclude it's Not Applicable. The evidence would be that all documents relate to court proceedings (TRO, motions, etc.) without any settlement agreements.\n\nSo the next action should be to update the checklist with \"Not Applicable\" for that key. But first, confirm that there's no settlement mentioned. The Docket has entries up to 6/24, but no settlement. The other documents (Complaint, Orders) are all court-related. So yes, it's Not Applicable.\n\nThus, the correct action is to call update_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" and the value \"Not Applicable\", along with evidence from the documents stating no settlement is present. For example, the Docket shows the case is ongoing with TRO extensions, no settlement terms mentioned. The Opinion and Order documents might also not mention settlement.\n\nSo the evidence could be from the Docket entry 54, which says the TRO is extended until June 25, 2025, and the parties are to file a joint status report. This indicates the case is still active, no settlement reached. Therefore, the settlement duration isn't applicable.\n\nThus, the tool call should be update_checklist with the key and the Not Applicable entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"As discussed at the hearing, the TRO granted on June 4, 2025 is hereby extended until and including June 25, 2025.

The user wants me to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", and the requirement is to get all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already marked this key as \"Not Applicable\" based on evidence from the Docket. The evidence given is from Entry 54 in the Docket, which mentions the TRO extension until June 25, 2025, and a joint status report. But the problem is that the user's instructions say to only include settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order. The TRO is a court order, so the extension isn't a settlement. The other evidence from the Case Opening Notice doesn't mention any settlement either.\n\nWait, the system's previous action was an update_checklist setting it to Not Applicable. But I need to verify if that's correct. The checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The TRO extension is part of a court order, so it shouldn't count. The Case Opening Notice also doesn't mention a settlement. So the key should indeed be Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's current status shows that How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is already marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The documents left are Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and the Order Granting TRO. The Order Granting TRO is a court order, so it's not a settlement. The Complaints are initial filings, not settlements. The Opinion and Order might have more info, but if it's a court order, it's not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order.\" So any settlement that's part of a court order shouldn't be included. The only mention of a settlement might be in the Complaints or other documents, but the Docket entries so far don't show any settlement terms. The TRO extension is a court order, so not relevant. The Case Opening Notice is just procedural.\n\nThe system already set it to Not Applicable, but I need to check if there's any other document that might have a settlement. The remaining documents are Complaints (001 and 002), which are probably the initial complaints filed, not settlements. The Opinion and Order might be a court decision, which would be a judgment, not a settlement. The Order Granting TRO is also a court order.\n\nSo, all documents either are court orders or initial filings, no actual settlements mentioned. Therefore, the Not Applicable is correct. The system should stop because all keys are handled (only one key, and it's marked Not Applicable with proper evidence).\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Not Applicable: 1/1\", so all keys are accounted for.

The user is asking to extract the settlement duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 used `update_checklist` to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from Docket entries. Step 4 tried to stop, but the system automatically ran `get_checklist` and now it's asking for another action.\n\nThe current status shows that \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" is marked as Not Applicable with evidence from Docket (Entry 54) and the Case Opening Notice. The evidence mentions the TRO extension until June 25, 2025, but that's a court order, not a settlement. The checklist definition says to exclude court orders, so the TRO extension doesn't count as a settlement obligation.\n\nThe user needs to confirm if there's any settlement duration outside court orders. The documents listed are Docket (partially read), Complaint (001, 002), Opinion and Order, and another Order. The Docket was partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the evidence for Not Applicable came from Entry 54, which is in the Docket. Wait, Entry 54 is in the Docket document, but the read_document was only up to 10000 tokens. The evidence from Entry 54 might be beyond 10000 tokens. Let me check the snapshot.\n\nIn Step 2, read_document on Docket (tokens 0-10000) included entries up to 56, but Entry 54 starts at 54, which is within 0-10000? Wait, the Docket entries listed in Step 2 go up to entry 56, but the token range read was 0-10000. The evidence cited for Not Applicable mentions Docket Entry 54 (tokens 10000-17264), which wasn't covered in the first read. Wait, the user's Step 2 says they read tokens 0-10000, but the evidence for Not Applicable is from tokens 10000-17264, which wasn't read yet. So the update_checklist in Step 3 might have been premature because they didn't actually read that part of the document.\n\nWait, the Step 3 says: \"Evidence 1 from Docket (Entry 54 (tokens 10000-17264))\". But in Step 2, they only read 0-10000. So Entry 54 is beyond the read range. That means the evidence for Not Applicable wasn't actually extracted from the document; it's a mistake. The user tried to set it to Not Applicable based on a part of the document they haven't read yet.\n\nSo the correct action now is to read the Docket document from tokens 10000 to 17264 (since the document is 17,264 tokens) to confirm the content of Entry 54. The current status shows Docket as partially visited (0-10000), so the next step should be to read the remaining tokens (10000-17264) to verify the evidence for the Not Applicable status.\n\nWait, but the user already used update_checklist with evidence from tokens 10000-17264, which they hadn't read. So the system is now showing that the evidence is cited from that range, but the actual document wasn't read. So to correct this, they need to read those tokens to confirm.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to call read_document on Docket from start_token 10000 to end_token 17264 (since the document is 17,264 tokens, but the end_token is exclusive, so up to 17264). Wait, the document's token count is 17,264, so tokens 0-17264. The viewed tokens are 0-10000, so remaining is 10000-17264. The maximum range is 10,000 tokens, so 17264-10000=7264, which is under 10,000, so it's okay.\n\nSo the correct action is to read_document on Docket, start_token 10000, end_token 17264.\n\nAfter reading that, they can verify the content of Entry 54 and confirm if it's indeed a court order (TRO extension) and not a settlement, thus justifying Not Applicable. Then, they can proceed to stop if confirmed.\n\nBut the current step is after the automatic get_checklist, and the user needs to decide the next action. Since the evidence for Not Applicable was cited from a part not read, they need to read that part first. Hence, the next action is read_document on Docket for tokens 10000-17264.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 17264}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 17264}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13974, "completion_tokens": 1185, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
