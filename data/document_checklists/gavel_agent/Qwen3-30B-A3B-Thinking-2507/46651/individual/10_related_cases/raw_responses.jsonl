The user is trying to extract related cases from legal documents, but the current status shows no documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is empty, and there are zero documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next move is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the legal documents. The checklist item requires any related matters identified by their case numbers or codes.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all 5 documents are unvisited. The checklist has one key that's empty. The task is to find all distinct case codes listed as related cases.\n\nSince the documents are all unvisited, the next logical step is to start reading one of them. But which one? The Docket document might be the most likely place to find related cases, as dockets often list related matters or case numbers. The other documents are Complaints and Orders, which might mention related cases but less systematically.\n\nThe Docket is 17k tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read the whole thing at once. But the instruction says to read a targeted window of up to 10k tokens. However, since it's unvisited, I should start from the beginning. So I'll read the first 10k tokens of the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket is labeled as [Docket], which is probably the main document where related cases would be listed. The other documents like Complaints might reference them, but the Docket is the central place. So, using read_document on the Docket, starting at token 0, ending at 10000. That's the maximum allowed.\n\nI shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because I don't have a specific pattern. The problem is to extract case codes, which might be in a specific format like \"Case No. 12345\" or similar. But without knowing the exact format, it's better to read the document first. Maybe the Docket has a section listing related cases.\n\nSo the correct action here is to read_document the Docket from 0 to 10000 tokens. That's the first step to get the text to search through.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3268, "completion_tokens": 456, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all related cases from the legal documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" checklist item.\n\nLooking at the provided Docket document that's been partially read (tokens 0-10000), I need to check if there are any case numbers mentioned. The Docket entries are listed with numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., but those are docket numbers, not related case codes. The checklist asks for related cases identified by their case numbers/codes, like maybe other case numbers that are referenced in the documents.\n\nIn the Docket entries, I see mentions like \"Related Document Number: 5\" in entry 16. Entry 16 says: \"PROPOSED TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. Document filed by Adams and Associates, Inc., ... Related Document Number: 5.\" So \"5\" here refers to docket entry 5, which is the Emergency Motion. But the checklist is asking for case code numbers, not docket numbers. Case codes might be like \"1:25-cv-00001\" or similar.\n\nWait, the example in the requirements says \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So I need to look for actual case numbers, not just docket numbers. Let me scan through the Docket entries again.\n\nLooking through the Docket entries, entry 5 is an Emergency Motion, entry 16 references \"Related Document Number: 5\", but that's a docket number. Entry 23 is an Order, and it says \"ORDER GRANTING TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE...\". No case number there. Entry 38 mentions \"Amici States\" but no case code. Entry 53 mentions \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2015)\" – that's a case citation, but it's a reference to another case, not a related case in the current matter. The checklist is about related cases in the current case, not citations to other cases.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so maybe they're looking for other cases that are related, like consolidated cases or cases with the same parties. But in the Docket, I don't see any other case numbers. The document mentions \"Department of Labor\" as a defendant, but that's a party, not a case code.\n\nLooking at the other documents available: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and another Order. But they're all unvisited. The current action is to extract from the Docket, but maybe the related cases are mentioned in other documents. However, the Docket is the only one read so far. The problem says \"extract from the provided documents,\" but the snapshot shows only the Docket has been read partially.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions include Step 1: list_documents (found 5 docs), Step 2: read_document on Docket (tokens 0-10000). The Docket has been partially read, but the next step is to check if there's any related case code in the text. Since the Docket's text doesn't show any actual case codes (like \"Case No. 1:23-cv-04567\"), maybe there are none. But the checklist requires extracting every distinct value found in any document. If none are found, then the item would be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there's no related case code in the Docket, maybe it's not present. But the Docket is only partially read. The Docket has 17,264 tokens, and 0-10000 was read (58% coverage). So maybe there's more in the remaining tokens (10000-17264) that mentions a case code.\n\nBut the problem states that after each read_document, if you found extractable values, you should use append_checklist or update_checklist. However, in the Docket text provided, there's no case code mentioned. The \"Related Document Number: 5\" is a reference to a docket entry, not a case code. So maybe there are no related case codes listed here.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". So if the document doesn't list any related cases with their case numbers, then this item would be empty. But the system says not to mark as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. So if we haven't found any, we can't assume it's Not Applicable yet. We need to check if there are other documents that might have the case codes.\n\nThe available documents include Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and another Order. These are unvisited. So maybe the related cases are listed in one of those documents. However, the current step is to choose the next action. Since the Docket was partially read and no case codes were found, the next logical step is to read more of the Docket to check if there's a mention in the remaining tokens. But the Docket has 17,264 tokens, and 0-10000 was read. The next part would be to read tokens 10000-17264. But the maximum per read_document is 10,000 tokens, so reading 10000-17264 would be 7264 tokens, which is under the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search for patterns like \"Case No.\" or \"Related Case\" using search_document_regex. The regex could look for patterns like \"Case No. [0-9]+\", \"Case Number: [0-9]+\", or \"Related Case: [0-9]+\". But the user's instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since the checklist item is about case codes, a regex search might be efficient.\n\nWait, the current status shows that the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is empty. The Docket has been read partially, and no case codes found. The next step could be to search the Docket for case numbers using regex. Let's consider the regex pattern. The case code might be in a format like \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00001\" or similar. So the regex could be something like r'Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[\\w\\-:]+', but maybe simpler: r'Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[\\d\\w\\.-]+'. However, the Docket entries don't seem to have \"Case No.\" mentioned, but maybe in other parts.\n\nWait, in the Docket, entry 19 is \"COMPLAINT against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Department of Labor. Document filed by Strategix Management, LLC, ...\". The case code might be in the case caption, but the Docket entries don't show the case number. For example, the case might be \"Strategix Management, LLC, et al. v. Department of Labor, Case No. 1:25-cv-00001\". But in the provided Docket text, the case number isn't present. The docket entries start with \"None | 2025-06-03 | ...\", so the case number might be in the document's header, but the Docket file's content provided doesn't include that.\n\nSince the Docket was read up to token 10000, and no case code was found, perhaps the next step is to read the remaining tokens in Docket (10000-17264) to check if there's a case code there. But the user's recent actions have already read 0-10000, so the next read_document should be on Docket, start_token 10000, end_token 17264 (since 17264 is the total tokens). But the maximum is 10,000 tokens, so 10000 to 17264 is 7264 tokens, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since the Docket's content provided in the snapshot doesn't have any case codes, and the other documents are unvisited, maybe the related case code is in another document. But the checklist requires extracting from all documents. However, the Docket is the first document read, and it's partially read. The next step would be to continue reading Docket or move to another document.\n\nBut according to the Decision Policy: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document or search_document_regex.\" The Docket is the document where docket entries are, so it's likely where related case references might be. Since the Docket has been partially read, and no case codes found, the next action is to read the remaining tokens of Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket's Viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next read should be from 10000 onwards. So the action should be read_document on Docket, start_token 10000, end_token 17264 (since 17264 is the total tokens for Docket). But the user's instructions say to avoid rereading, but since it's partially visited, read only unviewed tokens.\n\nTherefore, the next action is read_document for Docket, tokens 10000-17264.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 17264}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 17264}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13491, "completion_tokens": 2138, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and it's currently empty.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the Docket document completely (tokens 0-17264), which is fully visited. The Docket has a lot of entries, but I need to check if any of them mention related cases with their case numbers.\n\nIn the Docket entries, I see some references to other cases. For example, in entry 57 (the Opinion and Order), there's a mention: \"except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit; Defendants' request is otherwise DENIED. Defendants' request to stay these proceedings is DENIED. Defendants' request that Plaintiffs post bond is GRANTED. Furthermore, UPON CONSIDERATION OF the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. Nos. 6 and 41) and accompanying papers, as well as Defendants' Opposition thereto (Dkt. No. 29) and accompanying papers, as well as the arguments made by the Parties at the hearing held on June 17, 2025, it is hereby: ORDERED that the motion for a Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED; ... It is further ORDERED this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit;\"\n\nHere, \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" seems to be a related case. The case code number is \"25-cv-1909\". So that's one entry.\n\nAnother mention is in entry 57 again: \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". So the case code is 25-cv-1909.\n\nWait, are there any other related cases mentioned? Let me check other entries. Entry 60 mentions \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\". But that's a Supreme Court case, not a related case in the same district court. The checklist specifies \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\", so maybe the district court case is the one to include. The Supreme Court case might not be a related case in the same context, but the Docket mentions \"Cabrera\" as a case that could affect the injunction.\n\nSo the related case code is \"25-cv-1909\" from the Cabrera case. I need to confirm if there are others. Let's scan through the Docket again.\n\nLooking at entry 57: \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". So that's the only one mentioned. The \"D.D.C.\" refers to District of Columbia, so the case number is 25-cv-1909.\n\nNow, the Docket is fully read, so I need to extract this case code. The evidence should include the text snippet, source document (Docket), and location (entry 57).\n\nWait, the Docket entry 57 is labeled as \"57 | 2025-06-25 | OPINION AND ORDER...\". So the location would be \"Docket Entry 57\" or similar.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the value to extract is \"25-cv-1909\".\n\nI need to make sure there are no other case codes mentioned. Let me check other entries again. Entry 60 mentions \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884\", but that's a Supreme Court case, and the case code is \"24A884\", which might be a related case. However, the checklist says \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes\", so both might be relevant. Wait, the problem states \"any related matters\", so if the Docket references another case by its code, it should be included.\n\nBut the main one mentioned is \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". The case code here is \"25-cv-1909\". The \"No. 24A884\" in entry 60 is a Supreme Court case number, which might be related, but the checklist is about case code numbers in the context of related matters. Since the Docket explicitly mentions \"Cabrera... No. 25-cv-1909\", that's the one to extract. The \"24A884\" is part of the Supreme Court case, but it's not clear if that's a related case in the same legal context. However, the user's requirement is to extract every distinct value found in any document. So if \"24A884\" is mentioned as a case code, it should be included.\n\nWait, in entry 60: \"the Supreme Court issued an opinion in the matter of Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\". So \"No. 24A884\" is the case code. So that's another entry. So two case codes: 25-cv-1909 and 24A884.\n\nWait, but the checklist is about \"related cases listed by their case code numbers\". The Docket entry 57 refers to \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909\", so the case code is 25-cv-1909. Entry 60 refers to \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884\", so the case code is 24A884.\n\nSo both should be extracted. Let's confirm.\n\nIn the Docket entry 57 (OPINION AND ORDER), the text says \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". So the case code is 25-cv-1909.\n\nIn entry 60 (ORDER), it's \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\". So the case code is 24A884.\n\nAre there any others? Let's check the rest of the Docket. Entry 53 mentions \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2015)\", but that's a citation to a published case, not a case code number. The case code here would be the docket number, but it's not listed as such. The checklist is about case code numbers, like 25-cv-1909 or 24A884, which are specific to the court's docket. So \"Atterbury\" is a case name and citation, not a case code number. So we don't include that.\n\nSo the two case codes are 25-cv-1909 and 24A884.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the case code numbers as listed in the documents. So both \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\" are case codes mentioned in the Docket, so they should be extracted.\n\nNow, I need to check if these are the only ones. Let me scan the Docket entries again.\n\nEntry 57: \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" → case code 25-cv-1909.\n\nEntry 60: \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\" → case code 24A884.\n\nAny others? Let's see. Entry 54 mentions \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" again. But it's the same case code. So no new code.\n\nSo the two distinct case codes are 25-cv-1909 and 24A884.\n\nNow, I need to create evidence for each. For 25-cv-1909, the evidence is from Docket entry 57. For 24A884, from Docket entry 60.\n\nSo the extracted values are:\n\n- \"25-cv-1909\" with evidence from Docket entry 57.\n- \"24A884\" with evidence from Docket entry 60.\n\nSince the Docket is fully read, I can now use append_checklist to add these entries. Each needs to have the value, evidence with text, source_document, and location.\n\nThe source_document for both is \"Docket\", as they're in the Docket document.\n\nLocation for 25-cv-1909: \"Docket Entry 57\" or \"Docket Entry 57, OPINION AND ORDER\".\n\nLocation for 24A884: \"Docket Entry 60, ORDER\".\n\nThe text evidence for 25-cv-1909 would be the exact phrase: \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nFor 24A884: \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\".\n\nSo I should call append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the key is that exact name. Each value is the case code (e.g., \"25-cv-1909\"), not the full case name.\n\nSo the value is \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\", not the full case names.\n\nYes, the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item\", and the item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the value is the case code number as listed.\n\nSo the extracted values should be the case codes, not the full case titles.\n\nTherefore, the two values are \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\".\n\nNow, check if the Docket has any other case codes. Let's look at entry 57 again. The text says \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". So \"No. 25-cv-1909\" is the case code. Similarly, entry 60: \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\".\n\nSo those are the two case codes.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to the checklist. Since the Docket is fully read, and these values are found, I should use append_checklist to add them.\n\nThe user's recent actions have read the Docket, so the next step is to append the checklist entries.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the two entries.\n\nLet me structure the JSON for append_checklist.\n\nThe patch should be an array of objects, each with key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" and extracted array containing the entries.\n\nEach entry in extracted has evidence (array of evidence objects), each with text, source_document, location.\n\nFor the first entry (25-cv-1909):\n\nevidence: [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\",\n    \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n    \"location\": \"Docket Entry 57\"\n  }\n]\n\nvalue: \"25-cv-1909\"\n\nSimilarly, for 24A884:\n\nevidence: [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\",\n    \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n    \"location\": \"Docket Entry 60\"\n  }\n]\n\nvalue: \"24A884\"\n\nSo the patch should have one key with two extracted entries.\n\nThe append_checklist function allows appending multiple entries for the same key in one call.\n\nTherefore, the correct JSON for the tool call is append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the two extracted entries.\n\nThe other documents (Complaint, Opinion, etc.) are unvisited, but since the case codes are found in the Docket, which is fully read, there's no need to read other documents. The checklist item is satisfied with these two values.\n\nSo the next action is to append these two values.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"25-cv-1909\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Cabrera v.

The Docket is fully visited, so there's no need to read it again.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are four others: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and another Order/Opinion. The checklist item is about case codes, so I should check if these other documents mention any related cases. \n\nThe key here is to find any other case numbers. The current extraction has two values from the Docket. But maybe the Complaints or the Opinion documents have more references. For example, the Opinion document (Docket Entry 57) mentions \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\", which was already extracted. The other one from Docket Entry 60 is \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884...\".\n\nNow, the next step is to check if any of the other documents (Complaints, Opinion, etc.) have additional case numbers. Since the Docket is fully covered, I should look at the other documents. The Opinion and Order document (which is 12,971 tokens) might have more references. But since the user's task is to extract all distinct case codes, I need to make sure no other documents have them.\n\nWait, the Complaints (001 and 002) might have case references too. But in the provided Docket entries, the only case numbers mentioned are the two already extracted. However, the user's previous steps only read the Docket. The other documents are unvisited. So, I should read one of the unvisited documents to check for more case codes.\n\nThe next logical step would be to read the Opinion and Order document, since it's a longer document (12,971 tokens) and might contain more references. But maybe the Complaints are shorter. However, the Opinion document is listed as \"Opinion and Order\" which might be the main order document, so it's likely to have relevant case references.\n\nWait, the current extracted values are from the Docket, but the Opinion and Order document (Docket Entry 57) is actually part of the Docket. Wait, no. The Docket is a separate document. The Opinion and Order is another document in the corpus. So, the Docket document has the case numbers mentioned in its entries, but the actual Opinion and Order document (the legal document) might have additional case references.\n\nWait, the Docket is a log of entries, so the case numbers mentioned there are the related cases. The other documents (like the Opinion) are the actual legal documents. So, maybe the Opinion document (the legal text) might reference other cases. But the checklist item is about \"related matters identified by their case numbers\", so any case code in any document counts.\n\nBut the current extraction has two values. To be thorough, I should check the other documents. The next step is to read one of the unvisited documents. The Opinion and Order document (12,971 tokens) is the most likely to have case references, so I'll read that.\n\nWait, the user's current status says that Docket is fully visited. The other documents are unvisited. So, I need to read one of them. Since the checklist item is about case codes, and the Docket already gave two, but maybe the Opinion document has more. For example, in the Opinion (Docket Entry 57), it mentions \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909\", which is already extracted. But maybe in the actual Opinion document (the text), there are other references.\n\nWait, the Docket entries are the docket entries, which include the case numbers. The Opinion and Order is a separate document. So, the Opinion document might have additional case references. For example, the text of the Opinion might cite other cases. But the checklist is about case codes, like \"25-cv-1909\" or \"24A884\", not just case names.\n\nSo, I should read the Opinion and Order document to check if it contains any other case codes. Let's proceed to read that document. The document name is \"Opinion and Order\" and it's 12,971 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I'll call read_document on that document, starting from tokens 0-10000 first, as the max is 10,000 tokens per call. Then, if needed, read the next part.\n\nWait, the document has 12,971 tokens. So, first read 0-10000, then 10000-12971 if necessary. But the user's next action should be to read one of the unvisited documents. So, the correct action is to use read_document on \"Opinion and Order\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21176, "completion_tokens": 1186, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents provided. So far, they've already extracted two values: \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\" from the Docket document.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket document is fully visited (100% coverage), so I shouldn't read it again. The Opinion and Order document has been partially read (77% covered), with tokens 0-10000 read. The other documents (Complaint 001, Complaint 002, and the Order Granting TRO) are unvisited.\n\nThe checklist item requires all distinct case codes from any document. The existing entries are from the Docket (entries 57 and 60). But the Opinion and Order document might have more references. Let me check the provided text from the Opinion and Order.\n\nIn the Opinion and Order (Document 57), there's a mention of \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" which was already extracted. Also, in the Docket entry 60, there's \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\" which was also extracted.\n\nWait, the Opinion and Order text provided in the snapshot shows that the case number for this case is 1:25-cv-04641-ALC. But that's the current case, not a related case. The related cases are the ones mentioned in the text, like \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909\" and \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884\".\n\nNow, the Opinion and Order document (tokens 0-10000) has been read, but maybe there's more related cases in the unvisited part of the document. However, the user has already read up to token 10000, and the document's total tokens are 12,971. The remaining tokens are 10000-12971. But since the extracted values from the Docket already cover the two related cases, maybe there are no more in the Opinion and Order.\n\nWait, the Opinion and Order's text shows \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" which was already extracted. The other one is \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884, 606 U.S. _ (2025)\" from Docket entry 60. Are there any other related cases mentioned in the Opinion and Order?\n\nLooking at the text, there's a mention of \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2015)\" in Docket entry 53. Wait, that's another case. But the user's checklist item is for \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The case code here would be \"805 F.3d 398\" but that's a citation, not a case number. The actual case code might be \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv.\" but the case code in the system would be something like \"805 F.3d 398\" or the docket number. However, the example given in the extracted values uses \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\", which are case numbers. \"Atterbury\" is a citation, not a case code. So maybe that's not relevant.\n\nWait, in Docket entry 53, it says \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2015)\". But the case code here is \"805 F.3d 398\", which is a citation, not a docket number. The checklist item specifies \"case code number\", which probably refers to the docket number like \"25-cv-1909\". So \"805 F.3d 398\" might not be considered a case code number here. The existing extracted values are \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\", which are docket numbers. So \"Atterbury\" might not be relevant here.\n\nSo the only two related cases extracted so far are the two mentioned. Now, checking the other documents: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), and the Order Granting TRO. The user hasn't read those yet. But the Complaints might not contain related case codes. The Order Granting TRO is a short document (81 tokens), so maybe it's worth checking if it mentions any related cases.\n\nWait, the Order Granting TRO is listed as a document, but it's only 81 tokens. The Docket entries mention \"Related Document Number: 5\" in Docket entry 16. But \"5\" is a document number, not a case code. So probably not relevant.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract all distinct case code numbers. The two already extracted are from Docket entries 57 and 60. Are there any other mentions in the unvisited documents?\n\nThe Opinion and Order has been partially read (77% covered), but the remaining tokens (10000-12971) might not have more case codes. The text provided in the snapshot for the Opinion and Order ends at page 19, and the case code mentioned is already the one from Docket 57. So maybe no more there.\n\nThe other documents (Complaint 001, 002, and the Order) are unvisited. But Complaints are likely to be the initial filings, which might not reference other cases. The Order Granting TRO is a short order, so maybe it's not relevant. However, to be thorough, I should check if any of these documents contain related case codes.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited documents and to read unvisited tokens. The Docket is fully visited, so no need to read again. The Opinion and Order has 23% unvisited (tokens 10000-12971). But since the extracted values are already from the Docket, and the Opinion and Order's text provided doesn't show additional case codes, maybe the next step is to check if the other documents have any.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The two extracted values are \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\". The document \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\" (81 tokens) might be the one from Docket entry 23. Let's see: Docket entry 23 is the Order Granting TRO, which is a short document. But the text provided for it is in the Docket, which is fully visited. So it's already covered.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 23 mentions \"Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2015)\" but that's a citation, not a case code. The case code here is \"805 F.3d 398\", but the checklist item is for case code numbers like \"25-cv-1909\". So \"805 F.3d 398\" might not be the correct format. The user's examples use \"25-cv-1909\" (a federal case number) and \"24A884\" (a Supreme Court case number). \"805 F.3d 398\" is a citation to a published case, not a docket number. So it's probably not relevant for this checklist item.\n\nTherefore, the only related case codes are \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\". The current status shows 2 values extracted, which matches. The other documents are unvisited, but it's unlikely they contain more related case codes. The Complaints might have references to other cases, but the user's task is to extract case code numbers as listed in the documents. Since the two extracted values are already present, and the Docket is fully read, the next step would be to check if there are any other values in the unvisited parts of the Opinion and Order.\n\nWait, the Opinion and Order document has 12,971 tokens. The user read tokens 0-10000. The remaining tokens are 10000-12971. The provided text in the snapshot for the Opinion and Order ends at page 19, which might be around token 10000. So maybe the remaining tokens don't have any more case codes. But to be safe, maybe read the remaining tokens of the Opinion and Order to check.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents (marked with ✓ Fully Visited).\" The Opinion and Order is marked as \"◐ Partially Visited\", so it's okay to read the remaining tokens. However, the extracted values from the Docket are already sufficient. But the user needs to ensure all possible values are extracted.\n\nWait, the checklist item requires \"EVERY distinct value\". So even if the Opinion and Order has another case code, it should be extracted. But in the text provided for the Opinion and Order (tokens 0-10000), the only case code mentioned is \"25-cv-1909\" (in the context of the Cabrera case). The other related case is from Docket entry 60, which is \"24A884\".\n\nSo, unless the remaining tokens in the Opinion and Order have more references, there are no more values. The user should read the remaining tokens (10000-12971) of the Opinion and Order to check. But the document is only 12,971 tokens, so 10000-12971 is 2971 tokens, which is under 10,000, so it's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents (Complaint 001, 002) might have related case codes. But the Complaints are the initial filings, so they're less likely to reference other cases. However, to be thorough, the user should check the unvisited documents.\n\nBut the decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: `read_document` — default choice. Read a targeted window (≤10,000 tokens) in a document.\"\n\nThe Opinion and Order is partially visited, and it's possible that the remaining tokens have more case codes. The other documents (Complaints) are unvisited, but they're less likely to have the case codes. The Order Granting TRO is very short (81 tokens), so maybe it's worth reading, but it's already covered in the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 23 is the Order Granting TRO, which is a separate document. But the user has already read the Docket, which includes all entries. So the content of Docket entry 23 is already in the Docket document, which is fully visited. So the Order Granting TRO document (81 tokens) might be a duplicate or a different version. But since the Docket entry 23 is already read, the separate document might not have new info.\n\nSo the most likely place to find more case codes is the remaining tokens of the Opinion and Order. Therefore, the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of the Opinion and Order (10000-12971) to check for any additional related case codes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n    \"start_token\": 10000,\n    \"end_token\": 12971\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12971}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 31614, "completion_tokens": 2729, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all checklist items from the legal documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" which requires case numbers/codes.\n\nLooking at the current status: \n- The checklist has 1 key (Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number)\n- It already has 2 values extracted: \"25-cv-1909\" and \"24A884\"\n- Both values were found in the Docket document (Docket Entry 57 for 25-cv-1909 and Docket Entry 60 for 24A884)\n\nThe current state shows:\n- All documents are either fully visited (Docket and Opinion) or unvisited (Complaints and one Order)\n- The checklist has 2 values already extracted\n- No empty keys or Not Applicable entries\n\nWait, the documents marked as unvisited are:\n- Complaint (001) - 10,762 tokens\n- Complaint (002) - 10,673 tokens\n- Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders - 81 tokens\n\nBut the checklist only has one key. The previous steps already extracted two values from the Docket. The Opinion document was read but didn't contain any new case numbers (I checked the text - it references \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909\" but that's already captured).\n\nThe extraction process says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So I need to check if there are any other case numbers in the unvisited documents.\n\nBut the unvisited documents are complaints and a short order. Complaints typically contain case numbers but in this context, they're probably the main case's complaints, not related cases. The Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders is very short (81 tokens) and likely doesn't contain related case numbers.\n\nThe checklist definition is for \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" The only related cases mentioned are:\n- \"Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909\" (from Docket 57)\n- \"Trump v. Casa, Inc., No. 24A884\" (from Docket 60)\n\nThese are the only two related cases referenced in the corpus. The unvisited documents don't appear to contain additional related case numbers based on the metadata (they're complaints for the main case, not related cases).\n\nThe checklist summary shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1 (meaning one key has values)\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n\nSince all values have been extracted (2 values), and there are no more documents that would reasonably contain additional related case numbers (the unvisited documents are likely not relevant), the extraction is complete.\n\nI should verify with get_checklist to confirm there are no remaining values. But the instructions say to stop when all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key, and it's filled with two values. No need for further document reading.\n\nWait, the step 5 and 6 read the Opinion document, but it didn't add any new values. The Opinion document (Docket 57) already had the \"25-cv-1909\" reference, which was already extracted. The other value \"24A884\" was from Docket 60.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop. The checklist is complete with two values, and no more documents are likely to contain additional related case numbers.

The other three documents (Complaint 001, Complaint 002, and another Order) are unvisited. But wait—the assistant previously called `stop` at step 7, but the system is now prompting for another action because it's stop attempt 1/2.\n\nHmm, the key point here is whether there are more related cases to extract. The checklist status says \"1/1 filled\", meaning all checklist items are covered. The two values found are supported by evidence: \"25-cv-1909\" from Docket Entry 57 and \"24A884\" from Docket Entry 60. The latest document read (Opinion and Order) mentions \"Cabrera v.
