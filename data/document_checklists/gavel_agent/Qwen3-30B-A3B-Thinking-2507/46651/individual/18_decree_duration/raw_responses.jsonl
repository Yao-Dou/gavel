Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding.\n\nI should check if any other actions are possible. But since there are no documents, reading or searching wouldn't make sense yet. The user can't read a document that doesn't exist. So the only logical step is to list the documents to discover what's available.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call `list_documents` with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are available. The snapshot shows five documents: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, and another Order. All are unvisited, so I need to start reading them.\n\nSince the task is about decree duration, the \"Opinion and Order\" and the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" documents are the most likely to contain the decree details. The Docket might have some info too, but the specific order documents are better bets.\n\nThe user mentioned that the decree must be a court-ordered obligation, not a negotiated agreement. So I should look for phrases like \"injunction,\" \"consent decree,\" or \"judgment\" followed by duration terms like \"for 5 years,\" \"permanently,\" etc.\n\nStarting with the most relevant document first. The \"Opinion and Order\" is 12,971 tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read it all at once. But the snapshot says to read ≤10k tokens per call. So maybe split it into parts. Wait, the system says to avoid rereading, so first read a portion.\n\nWait, the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" is only 81 tokens. That's tiny, so maybe check that first. But it's a temporary restraining order, not a decree. The checklist specifies \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" Temporary restraining orders might not be the same as decrees. So maybe skip that one first.\n\nNext, the \"Opinion and Order\" document. Let's read the first 10k tokens. Wait, the document is 12,971 tokens. So start at 0, end at 10,000. That's within the limit. So the next action should be read_document for \"Opinion and Order\" from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n\nWait, but the Docket might have the decree duration listed. Dockets often list orders and their durations. But the checklist says to look for court-ordered decrees, so the Opinion and Order is more likely to have the actual text of the decree.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for patterns like \"decree\" followed by duration. But the instructions say to use regex when the target is clearly patternable. The pattern might be something like \"for [0-9]+ years\" or \"permanently\". But maybe better to first read the Opinion document to see if it's there.\n\nWait, the user's step 1 was list_documents, which found 5 docs. Now, step 2 is to proceed. The next logical step is to read a document. The most relevant is Opinion and Order. So call read_document on that.\n\nCheck the token count: 12,971 tokens. So start_token=0, end_token=10000. That's allowed.

The user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of the \"Opinion and Order\" document. The provided text is from that document, but I need to check if there's any mention of a decree's duration.\n\nScanning through the text, I see references to the injunction granted. For example, in the opinion, it says \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\" But the duration isn't specified here. The court granted the injunction but doesn't state how long it will last. The text mentions the TRO (temporary restraining order) was extended until June 25, 2025, but that's a temporary measure, not the decree duration.\n\nWait, the decree here is the preliminary injunction. The problem is, the duration isn't stated in the provided text. The court says the TRO was extended until June 25, but the preliminary injunction's duration isn't specified. The document might not mention it, or it could be in another part not covered in the read tokens.\n\nThe current document \"Opinion and Order\" has tokens 0-10000 read, but the text stops at page 19, which is part of the opinion. The decree's duration might not be in this section. Maybe it's in another document. The other documents are Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, and another Order. The Docket might have the order's terms, but the current read document doesn't have the duration.\n\nSince the current read document (Opinion and Order) doesn't mention the decree duration, I need to check other documents. The next step would be to read another document, perhaps the Docket, which might list the order's specifics. But the Docket is unvisited. Alternatively, maybe the Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders mentions the duration, but it's only 81 tokens and unvisited.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract the decree duration. If the provided text doesn't have it, then perhaps the duration isn't specified, but the instructions say to set Not Applicable only with explicit evidence. Since the text doesn't mention it, I can't assume it's Not Applicable yet. I need to check other documents.\n\nThe available documents include the Docket and the other Order. The Docket might have the order's terms. The Docket is 17,264 tokens, unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document to see if it contains the decree duration.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to use read_document for targeted windows. Since the Docket is unvisited, I should call read_document on the Docket, maybe starting from 0. But the current document catalog shows Docket as ○ Unvisited, so I need to read it. Alternatively, maybe the Order Granting TRO has the duration, but it's only 81 tokens. Let me check the document names again.\n\nThe Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders is listed as 81 tokens, unvisited. Maybe that's the document that specifies the duration. Since it's a short document, reading it entirely (within 10k tokens) would make sense. So the next action should be to read that document.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions already read the Opinion and Order. The next step is to check other documents. The Docket might be more likely to have the decree terms, but the Order Granting TRO is the actual order that might state the duration. The TRO was extended to June 25, but the preliminary injunction's duration might be in that order.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. But the document name is a bit long, but the system should handle it. Let me check the exact name: \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\" [Order/Opinion] - 81 tokens.\n\nSince it's only 81 tokens, reading the whole thing (tokens 0-81) would be efficient. So the action is to call read_document with doc_name as that exact name and start_token 0, end_token 81.\n\nBut wait, the current status says the Opinion and Order is partially visited (0-10000), and the Docket is unvisited. The Order Granting TRO is also unvisited. Given that it's a short document, reading it makes sense. The user needs to find where the decree duration is mentioned. The Opinion mentions the injunction is granted but doesn't state the duration. The actual order document might have the duration.\n\nSo the correct next action is to read the Order Granting TRO document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 81}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 81}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13752, "completion_tokens": 1109, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The documents available include \"Opinion and Order\" (partially read), \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" (fully read), and three unvisited documents: two Complaints and a Docket.\n\nIn the \"Opinion and Order\" document, I read tokens 0-10000. The text mentions a preliminary injunction granted, but I need to check if there's any duration specified. The excerpt shows the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, but the actual duration isn't mentioned in the provided text. The order might have a specific time frame, but the read portion ends at page 19, which doesn't include the order's duration. The \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" document was fully read (tokens 0-81), but it's just a cover page with no content about the decree duration.\n\nThe other documents (Complaints and Docket) haven't been read yet. The Docket might list the order details, including duration. The Complaints might mention the requested relief, but typically the duration would be in the court's order.\n\nSince the current read documents don't have the duration, I should check the Docket document next.

The current status shows that \"Docket\" and \"Opinion and Order\" have been partially read (tokens 0-10000), \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" is fully visited, and the two Complaint documents are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the \"Opinion and Order\" document, the user read tokens 0-10000. The key part about the decree duration might be in the order itself. Let me check the text provided. The document mentions a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) granted on June 4, 2025, which was extended until June 25, 2025. The order says: \"the TRO granted on June 4, 2025 is hereby extended until and including June 25, 2025.\"\n\nSo the duration of the TRO is from June 4 to June 25, which is 21 days. But the checklist asks for the decree duration as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". The TRO is a temporary order, but the final decree might be the Opinion and Order issued later. Wait, the document is titled \"Opinion and Order\" and it grants a preliminary injunction. Let me check if the duration is specified there.\n\nIn the \"Opinion and Order\" text, the judge says: \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\" But the actual duration of the decree isn't explicitly stated in the excerpt provided. The TRO was extended to June 25, but the preliminary injunction's duration might be different. Wait, the document says \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted\" but doesn't specify the duration. However, the TRO extension is mentioned as until June 25, but that's a temporary order, not the final decree.\n\nWait, the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" (Document 23) has the TRO, which is extended to June 25. But the checklist item is for \"decree duration\" from formal court orders like injunctions. The TRO is a temporary order, not a final decree. The final decree (the preliminary injunction) might have a duration, but the excerpt from the Opinion and Order doesn't state it. The text says the motion for preliminary injunction is granted, but the duration isn't specified in the given text.\n\nWait, in the Docket entry for Document 57 (the Opinion and Order), the document says: \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\" But the duration isn't mentioned. However, in the Order Granting TRO (Document 23), the TRO was extended to June 25, but that's a temporary measure. The actual preliminary injunction might have a longer duration, but the text provided doesn't specify it. The user's task is to extract the duration from the documents, so if it's not stated, maybe it's Not Applicable, but the instructions say not to mark as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\" So the duration needs to be a specific time period. In the TRO extension, it's \"until and including June 25, 2025,\" which is a specific end date. The duration would be from June 4 to June 25, 21 days. But the TRO is a temporary order, not a decree. The preliminary injunction granted in the Opinion and Order might have a different duration. However, the text provided doesn't state the duration for the preliminary injunction. The Opinion and Order states the motion is granted but doesn't specify the duration. The Docket entry for Document 57 (the Opinion and Order) might have the duration, but the user only read up to page 19, and the text ends with \"D\" on page 19.\n\nWait, the \"Opinion and Order\" document's text ends with \"D\" on page 19, but the actual duration might be in the order part. However, the provided excerpt doesn't include the exact duration. The user needs to check if there's a specific duration mentioned. Since the document says \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted,\" but doesn't state how long it lasts, perhaps the duration is not specified in the documents, so it should be marked as Not Applicable. But wait, the TRO was extended until June 25, which is a specific duration. However, the TRO is a temporary restraining order, not a decree. The checklist specifies \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction,\" so the preliminary injunction is a decree, but the duration isn't stated.\n\nWait, the Opinion and Order (Document 57) says \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted,\" but the actual duration might be in the order itself. The order might state the duration, but in the provided text, it's not there. The user might need to read more of the document. However, the \"Opinion and Order\" was partially read (tokens 0-10000), which is 77% coverage. The document has 12,971 tokens, so there's still 23% unread. But the user has to check if the duration is mentioned in the part they've read.\n\nLooking at the provided text from the \"Opinion and Order\" (tokens 0-10000), the relevant parts are in the discussion of the preliminary injunction. The judge grants the motion, but there's no mention of the duration. The TRO extension is mentioned in Document 23 (the Order Granting TRO), which is fully read. The TRO was extended to June 25, but that's a temporary order. The checklist item is for the decree duration, which would be the preliminary injunction's duration. Since the text doesn't specify the duration, perhaps it's not present, but the user needs to check if there's any mention.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for Document 57 (the Opinion and Order) says it's the \"Opinion and Order,\" so the actual order part might be in the document. However, the provided text ends with \"D\" on page 19, which might be a typo, but the key part about the decree duration isn't in the excerpt. The user might need to read more of the document to find the duration. But according to the current state, the \"Opinion and Order\" has been read up to 10,000 tokens, which is 77% coverage. Since the document is 12,971 tokens, there's 2,971 tokens left. However, the user can't read beyond the current coverage without specifying the next token range.\n\nWait, the next step is to choose an action. The user has to read a targeted window. The key is to find where the decree duration is mentioned. The TRO extension is in Document 23 (the Order Granting TRO), but that's a temporary order, not the decree. The decree would be in the Opinion and Order (Document 57). The user needs to check if the duration is in the remaining part of Document 57. So the next action should be to read the next token range of Document 57, say from 10001 to 20000 (but since the document is 12,971 tokens, it's up to 12971).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the duration is mentioned in the Docket. The Docket has entries like \"ORDER GRANTING TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE...\" which says \"It is further ORDERED that the motion for a Temporary Restraining Order is GRANTED... until and including June 25, 2025.\" But the TRO is temporary, not a decree. The checklist specifies \"decree\" as in the preliminary injunction, so the TRO duration might not count. However, the user needs to confirm.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Only include obligations that are ordered by the court. Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\"\n\nThe TRO is a court order, so its duration might be considered. The TRO is extended until June 25, so the duration is 21 days (from June 4 to June 25 inclusive). So the value would be \"21 days: Temporary Restraining Order extending until June 25, 2025.\"\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if this is the correct decree. The TRO is a temporary order, but the checklist includes \"injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction,\" so a TRO might not be considered a decree. The preliminary injunction is the decree, but its duration isn't specified in the text provided.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for Document 23 (the TRO order) says the TRO is granted until June 25. The Opinion and Order (Document 57) grants the preliminary injunction, but the duration isn't stated. However, the TRO is part of the process, but the decree duration for the preliminary injunction might be longer. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe the duration is not found, so it's Not Applicable. But the user must have evidence.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract from the documents. The only duration mentioned is the TRO extension. The checklist might consider the TRO as part of the decree process, but the instructions say \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction,\" so the preliminary injunction is the decree. The TRO is a temporary measure, so perhaps it's not the decree. Therefore, the duration for the decree (preliminary injunction) is not specified in the documents, so it should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user needs to check if there's any mention in the documents.\n\nGiven the current state, the user has read the Opinion and Order up to 10,000 tokens, but the duration might be in the remaining part. However, the user has to choose the next action. The correct move is to read the next part of the Opinion and Order document to check if the duration is mentioned. Since the document is 12,971 tokens, the next token range could be 10001-12971 (2971 tokens, which is under 10,000).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the duration is in the Docket. The Docket entry for Document 57 (the Opinion and Order) might have the duration, but the Docket is a list of entries, not the actual order. The actual order is in Document 57.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of the Opinion and Order document. The current viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next read should be 10001-12971.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document on \"Opinion and Order\" with start_token 10001 and end_token 12971.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 12971}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 12971}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24152, "completion_tokens": 2484, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The recent actions show that they've read the Opinion and Order (tokens 0-12971), the Order Granting TRO (tokens 0-81), and the Docket (tokens 0-10000). The documents \"Complaint (001)\" and \"Complaint (002)\" are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the Opinion and Order document, which is fully visited, there's a part where the court issues an injunction. Let me check the text. In the \"CONCLUSION\" section, the court orders: \"It is further ORDERED that Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in concert or participation with Defendants are ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers...\". Then later, \"It is further ORDERED this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit.\"\n\nWait, the key here is the duration. The injunction is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". So the duration is until the outcome of that case. The court says it's \"pending the outcome\", which means it lasts until that case is resolved. But the exact duration isn't specified as a time period like \"until 2026\" or \"for 2 years\". The injunction is ongoing until the other case concludes.\n\nThe requirement is to extract each duration as a separate value formatted as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". The duration here is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". But the problem is, the duration isn't a fixed time frame but rather until another case's resolution. However, the instruction says to extract the duration as it's stated. So the value should be \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nWait, but the checklist item says \"the duration of decree obligations\". The court's order says \"this injunction shall be nationwide... pending the outcome of Cabrera...\". So the duration is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nI need to check if there's another part in the document that specifies a fixed time. Looking through the text again, the TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) was extended until June 25, 2025, as per Document 54. But the preliminary injunction in the Opinion and Order is a different order. The TRO was extended to June 25, but the final injunction's duration is tied to the outcome of the other case.\n\nWait, in the Opinion and Order (Document 57), the court states: \"It is further ORDERED this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit.\"\n\nSo the duration is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". Therefore, the extracted value should be that phrase.\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be the verbatim text. The relevant part is: \"this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit.\"\n\nSo the value is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v.

So the duration is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera...\", and the decree obligation is the injunction itself. But the example given in the checklist might need the duration part. Wait, the instruction says \"the duration of decree obligations\", so the duration is the time aspect. Here, the duration is \"pending the outcome of...\", so that's the duration.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to have the verbatim text. The exact quote is from the order: \"this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit.\"\n\nSo the text for evidence is that part. The source document is \"Opinion and Order\", location is \"Page 24, Section CONCLUSION\" or similar. But the document shows page numbers, so in the text, it's on Page 24.\n\nWait, in the provided text for Opinion and Order (tokens 10001-12971), the relevant part is on Page 24:\n\n\"It is further ORDERED this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit;\"\n\nSo the location would be \"Page 24\" or \"Page 24 of 25\" as per the document's page numbering.\n\nNow, the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" needs to have this value added. Since the document is fully visited, and this value was found, the next step is to use `append_checklist` to add this entry.\n\nCheck if there are other possible durations. The TRO was extended until June 25, 2025, but the TRO is a temporary restraining order, not the final decree. The final decree here is the preliminary injunction, which is the one with the duration tied to the other case. So the main decree (the preliminary injunction) has the duration as \"pending the outcome of...\", so that's the value to extract.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to append the checklist with this value. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist would have:\n\n- key: \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\"\n- extracted: [ { value: \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\", evidence: [ { text: \"this injunction shall be nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit\", source_document: \"Opinion and Order\", location: \"Page 24\" } ] } ]\n\nWait, the value should be the duration part. The duration is \"pending the outcome...\", so the value is that phrase. The decree obligation is the injunction itself, but the checklist item is asking for the duration, so the value is the duration string.\n\nYes, so the value is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nNow, checking if this is the only value. The other documents are unvisited, but since the Opinions and Orders already contain this, and the other documents (Complaints) are likely not to have the decree duration (since the decree is from the court order), it's safe to proceed with this.\n\nSo the next action is to append this value using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v.

The user is asking for the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Opinion and Order document. The value they found is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\". That's from page 24 of the Opinion and Order.\n\nNow, checking the available documents: Docket is partially visited (58% covered), Opinion and Order is fully visited, Order Granting TRO is fully visited, and there are two unvisited Complaint documents (Complaint 001 and 002). The user needs to make sure they've checked all relevant documents for this checklist item.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract \"every distinct value\" of the decree duration. They have one value so far. But maybe there are more in other documents. The Docket document has some text, but it's mostly about case filings and motions, not the decree duration. The Complaint documents are unvisited, so I should check those to see if they contain any decree duration information.\n\nWait, the Opinion and Order already has the decree duration mentioned in the final order. The Docket might have other orders, but the Order Granting TRO was fully read and only has 81 tokens, which probably doesn't contain the decree duration. The Complaints might not have the decree since it's a preliminary injunction case, and the decree would be in the final order.\n\nBut the user's current extraction is based on the Opinion and Order. Let me confirm: the value they extracted is from the injunction's scope, which says \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor...\". That's the decree duration.\n\nSince they've already read the Opinion and Order completely (it's marked as fully visited), and the Docket and other documents don't seem to contain relevant decree information, there might not be more values to extract. The Checklist Summary shows all keys are filled (1/1), so they should stop.\n\nWait, but the system says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" has one value, so it's filled. The user has already used append_checklist to add that value. The next step would be to check if there's any need to update or if they should stop.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", so all keys are covered. The user should stop here. But the instructions say to use get_checklist to verify before stopping, but since they've already confirmed the value is extracted, and the checklist is complete, they can stop.\n\nWait, but the user's last action was append_checklist, which added the value. Now, after appending, they should verify if all values are covered. Since there's only one key and it's filled, they should stop. The next action should be to stop, not do another read_document.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the two Complaints are unvisited, but they're complaints, not orders, so they probably don't contain the decree duration. The decree duration would be in the court's order, which they've already read (Opinion and Order). So no need to read more documents.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.

The user is asking to extract the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. From the provided snapshot, I see that in Step 6, they used `append_checklist` to add one value from the Opinion and Order document. The value is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\" with evidence from page 24.\n\nNow, checking the current status: the checklist has 1 key filled (How_Long_Decrees_will_Last) with 1 value. The documents show that Opinion and Order is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so there's no need to read it again. The other documents are either partially visited (Docket) or unvisited (Complaints), but the decree duration is already found in the Opinion and Order. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" But the current extraction has only one value. Is there any other document that might have a different decree duration? The Docket and Complaint documents are unvisited, but the decree duration is a court-ordered obligation, which would likely be in the final order (Opinion and Order), not in the docket or complaints. The docket entries are mostly about filings and notices, not the actual decree terms. The Complaints would contain claims, not the court's decree.\n\nAlso, the system says \"No further documents need to be checked as the decree duration is explicitly stated in the court's final order.\" So the only value is the one already extracted. The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, so all keys are covered. The Not Applicable count is 0, which makes sense because the decree duration is present.\n\nThe user's next action should be to stop since all required items are extracted. The system allows a second stop attempt, and this is the first stop attempt. But since the checklist is fully filled with the correct evidence, stopping now is appropriate. The previous stop attempt (Step 7) was called, but the system did an automatic get_checklist, and now it's asking for the next action. The current status shows all keys are filled, so the next logical step is to stop again.\n\nWait, the \"Your Next Action\" section says \"Call `stop` again if you're satisfied...\" So after the automatic get_checklist, the correct action is to stop. The system's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable.
