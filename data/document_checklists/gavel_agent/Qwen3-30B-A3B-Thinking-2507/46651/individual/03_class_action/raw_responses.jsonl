The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows all keys are empty, and there are 5 unvisited documents. The task is to find where the class action status is mentioned. Since the documents are all unvisited, the next step should be to read one of them. But which one?\n\nLooking at the document list, the Complaints (001 and 002) are likely to contain the main allegations, including whether it's a class action. The Docket might have procedural info, and the Orders might mention if it's certified as a class action. But the Complaint is the most probable place to find the initial designation.\n\nThe user said to read a targeted window up to 10k tokens. The Complaint (001) is 10,762 tokens, so reading the first 10k tokens makes sense. The first few pages of a complaint usually state the nature of the suit. So, I should call read_document on Complaint (001) from token 0 to 10000.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all are unvisited, so no need to list documents again. The next action should be to read a document. Since the Complaints are the primary source for the plaintiff's claims, starting with Complaint (001) is logical. Using read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 would cover the bulk of the document without exceeding the token limit. That's the best first step to get the necessary information.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3305, "completion_tokens": 396, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. From the snapshot, I can see that the current status shows this key is empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Complaint (001)\" and the text provided shows the complaint document. I need to check if this document contains the required information about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nScanning through the complaint text, I notice that the plaintiffs are listed as multiple entities: National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., etc. The complaint starts with \"NATIONAL JOB CORPS ASSOCIATION, JOCELYN RIVERA, ADAMS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVES, INC., EDUCATION & TRAINING RESOURCES, LLC, STRATEGIX MANAGEMENT, LLC, TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS UNION/IAM, Plaintiffs.\" \n\nThe key question is whether this constitutes a class action or individual plaintiffs. In legal terms, when multiple plaintiffs sue together but not as a formal class action (which would require a class certification), it's considered individual plaintiffs. The complaint doesn't mention \"class action\" or \"class certification\" anywhere in the provided text. The plaintiffs are listed individually with specific descriptions of each entity.\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since there's no mention of class action here, and the plaintiffs are listed as separate entities with their own descriptions (like \"Plaintiff Adams and Associates, Inc. is a 100% employee-owned company...\"), this should be classified as individual plaintiffs.\n\nI need to create an extracted entry with the value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list of plaintiff entities]\". The evidence should be the specific part where the plaintiffs are listed.\n\nLooking at the document, the \"PARTIES\" section (paragraphs 3-11) lists each plaintiff with their descriptions. The very beginning of the complaint also lists all plaintiffs. The key part is the caption: \"NATIONAL JOB CORPS ASSOCIATION, JOCELYN RIVERA, ADAMS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVES, INC., EDUCATION & TRAINING RESOURCES, LLC, STRATEGIX MANAGEMENT, LLC, TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS UNION/IAM, Plaintiffs.\"\n\nSo the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., Alternate Perspectives, Inc., Education & Training Resources, LLC, Strategix Management, LLC, Transportation Communications Union/IAM\".\n\nI should use append_checklist to add this entry since it's the first value found. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is from the caption, so location would be \"Caption\" or \"Page 1 of 21\". The source is \"Complaint (001)\".\n\nWait, the document says \"Complaint (001)\" and the text shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 19 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 21\" at the top. So location can be \"Caption (Page 1)\".\n\nI need to make sure the value follows the exact format: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description should list all the plaintiffs as they appear in the complaint.\n\nThe complaint lists them as:\n- National Job Corps Association\n- Jocelyn Rivera\n- Adams and Associates, Inc.\n- Alternate Perspectives, Inc.\n- Education & Training Resources, LLC\n- Strategix Management, LLC\n- Transportation Communications Union/IAM\n\nSo the description part should include all these names. The value would be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., Alternate Perspectives, Inc., Education & Training Resources, LLC, Strategix Management, LLC, Transportation Communications Union/IAM\".\n\nNow, checking if there are any other documents that might have more information, but since this is the first document read and it contains the necessary info, I should extract it now. The other documents are unvisited, but since we have the value from the first document, we don't need to read more unless there's a possibility of multiple values (but the requirement says \"every distinct value\", and this seems to be the only one).\n\nSo the next action is to append this value using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., Alternate Perspectives, Inc., Education & Training Resources, LLC, Strategix Management, LLC, Transportation Communications Union/IAM\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NATIONAL JOB CORPS ASSOCIATION, JOCELYN RIVERA, ADAMS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVES, INC., EDUCATION & TRAINING RESOURCES, LLC, STRATEGIX MANAGEMENT, LLC, TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS UNION/IAM, Plaintiffs.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint (001)\", \"location\": \"Caption (Page 1)\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., Alternate Perspectives, Inc., Education & Training Resources, LLC, Strategix Management, LLC, Transportation Communications Union/IAM", "evidence": [{"text": "NATIONAL JOB CORPS ASSOCIATION, JOCELYN RIVERA, ADAMS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVES, INC., EDUCATION & TRAINING RESOURCES, LLC, STRATEGIX MANAGEMENT, LLC, TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS UNION/IAM, Plaintiffs.", "source_document": "Complaint (001)", "location": "Caption (Page 1)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13896, "completion_tokens": 1174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the class action status from legal documents, specifically for the checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". \n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from Complaint (001) where the plaintiffs are listed as multiple entities including individuals. The extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list of plaintiffs]\". \n\nBut wait - the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\" and \"Create separate entries for each unique value\". The current extraction has one entry, but is that the only value? \n\nHmm, the complaint lists multiple plaintiffs: National Job Corps Association (a group), Jocelyn Rivera (an individual), and several companies. The description says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list]\". But is this a class action or individual plaintiffs? \n\nThe key here is understanding the legal terminology. In this case, the complaint is brought by multiple plaintiffs who are acting as individuals (not as a class), but some are organizations. The checklist requires formatting as either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". \n\nThe current extraction seems correct since it's not a class action (no class certification mentioned), but I need to confirm if there's any other document that might indicate class action status. \n\nLooking at the available documents: \n- Complaint (001) is partially read (93% covered)\n- Complaint (002) is unvisited\n- Docket, Opinion, and Order are unvisited\n\nThe user's recent action was append_checklist with one value from Complaint (001). But the document says \"Complaint (001)\" and the text shows multiple plaintiffs. \n\nWait - the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". Is there a possibility that another document has different status? For example, maybe the Docket or Order mentions class action. \n\nBut the current checklist item only has one key, and they've already extracted one value. However, the requirement says \"every distinct value\", so if there's only one value in the corpus, that's it. \n\nBut I should check if the current extraction is accurate. The extracted value says \"Individual, described as [list]\". The complaint lists: \n- National Job Corps Association (organization)\n- Jocelyn Rivera (individual)\n- Adams and Associates, Inc. (organization)\n- Etc.\n\nSo yes, this is individual plaintiffs, not a class action. The description is correct.\n\nNow, do I need to check other documents? The checklist might have other values, but the task is only to extract \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". \n\nThe current status shows 1 key with 1 value. But let's verify if the document has any indication of class action. Scanning the text, I don't see \"class action\" mentioned anywhere. The complaint is filed by multiple plaintiffs, but they're not acting as a class - each is a separate plaintiff. \n\nSo the extraction is correct. But wait - the user's step 3 already appended this value. Now, the next step should be to check if there are more values in other documents. \n\nThe available documents include Complaint (002) which is unvisited. Maybe that one has different status? But the task is to extract from all documents, so I should read Complaint (002) to be thorough.\n\nHowever, the system says: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" but Complaint (001) is partially visited (only 93% read). Wait, the catalog shows Complaint (001) as ◐ Partially Visited with tokens 0-10000 (93% coverage). The document is 10,762 tokens, so 10,000 tokens is 93% (since 10,000/10,762 ≈ 0.93). So there's about 762 tokens left unread. \n\nBut the extracted value came from the caption (page 1), which is in the first 10,000 tokens. The rest of the document is unlikely to have more plaintiffs' status. Still, to be safe, I should read the remaining tokens of Complaint (001) to ensure no other mentions. \n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"When reading partially visited documents (marked with ◐ Partially Visited), read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" So for Complaint (001), unviewed tokens are 10,000-10,762. \n\nBut the checklist item is already filled with one value. Is there a chance the remaining text has more? Probably not, since plaintiffs are listed in the caption. But to be thorough, I should read the remaining tokens. \n\nHowever, the user's recent action was append_checklist after reading 0-10000. The remaining 762 tokens are small, but the max read is 10,000, so it's fine. \n\nBut wait, the next action should be to either read the remaining tokens of Complaint (001) or move to another document. Since the current value is already extracted and the document is almost fully read, maybe I should read the last part to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, check if Complaint (002) might have different information. But Complaint (002) is a different document - it might be a different case. \n\nGiven that the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" for this specific case, and the complaint is the primary document, it's more efficient to finish reading the current document before moving to others. \n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Complaint (001) for tokens 10000-10762. \n\nBut the system says: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action, analyze the text to identify all checklist items.\" So if I read the remaining tokens, I might find more values. However, it's unlikely since plaintiffs are already listed at the start. \n\nBut to be safe, I'll read the remaining tokens. The document is small (762 tokens), so it's efficient. \n\nSo the next function call should be read_document for Complaint (001) with start_token 10000, end_token 10762. \n\nWait, the document's token count is 10,762, so end_token should be 10762. \n\nConfirming: start_token inclusive, end_token exclusive. So 10000 to 10762 (762 tokens).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint (001)\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 10762}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint (001)", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 10762}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14095, "completion_tokens": 1456, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to format it as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 already appended the value from the Complaint (001). The extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as National Job Corps Association, Jocelyn Rivera, Adams and Associates, Inc., Alternate Perspectives, Inc., Education & Training Resources, LLC, Strategix Management, LLC, Transportation Communications Union/IAM\". The evidence is from the caption on Page 1 of the Complaint.\n\nNow, the current status shows that all keys have been filled (1 out of 1). The document catalog shows that Complaint (001) is fully visited, but there are other unvisited documents: Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, and another Order. However, the checklist item is already extracted from the first document.\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract EVERY distinct value. The current extraction shows individual plaintiffs. But I need to check if there's a class action mentioned anywhere else. The problem is that the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. In the Complaint (001), the plaintiffs are listed as multiple entities, which suggests it's a class action. Wait, but the extracted value says \"Individual, described as...\" which might be a mistake. Wait, the checklist definition says the value should be 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...'. So if it's a class action, it should be the first format. But in the document, the plaintiffs are listed as multiple entities, which might indicate a class action, but the extracted value says \"Individual\". Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the extraction.\n\nWait, looking back at the Complaint, the caption says \"NATIONAL JOB CORPS ASSOCIATION, JOCELYN RIVERA, ADAMS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., etc.\" as plaintiffs. So it's multiple plaintiffs, but not necessarily a class action. A class action would typically have a class representative, like \"Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.\" But here, it's listed as individual plaintiffs. So the extraction might be correct as \"Individual\" because it's not a class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs are named individually, not as a class.\n\nBut I should check if any other documents mention a class action. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion, etc. However, the checklist item is already filled with one value. The system says to extract every distinct value. If the current extraction is correct, then there's only one value. But maybe there's another document that specifies it as a class action.\n\nWait, the current extracted value says \"Individual\", but maybe the complaint is actually a class action. Let me check the document again. The complaint's caption lists multiple plaintiffs, but in class actions, sometimes the lead plaintiff is named, and others are part of the class. However, here it's listed as \"Plaintiffs\" followed by multiple names, which might indicate individual plaintiffs. For example, \"National Job Corps Association\" is a trade organization, and \"Jocelyn Rivera\" is an individual. So it's a mix of entities and individuals, but not a class action. So the extraction as \"Individual\" is correct.\n\nBut the checklist definition says \"Class Action or Individual Plaintiffs\". So if it's not a class action, it's individual. So the current extraction is correct.\n\nNow, the current status shows 1 value extracted, and all keys are filled. The available documents have others unvisited, but if the checklist item is already extracted and no other documents are needed (since the value is already found), then the next step might be to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says to extract every distinct value. If there's only one value (individual plaintiffs), and it's already extracted, then all keys are filled. The status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are done.\n\nWait, the checklist has only one item: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. So once that's filled, the process is complete. The current extraction is from the first document, and the value is correctly extracted as individual plaintiffs. The other documents might not have more information on this, but since the value is already extracted, there's no need to check other documents.\n\nThe user's instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same value is repeated in another document, it's still the same value, so no need to append again. But if another document says \"Class Action\", then that would be a different value. However, in this case, the current extraction is \"Individual\", and if no other document says \"Class Action\", then it's the only value.\n\nBut since the other documents are unvisited, maybe I should check if there's a mention of class action in another document. Wait, the current status shows that the key is already filled. The system's stop criteria is when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with one value, so it's complete.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action (Step 4) read the rest of Complaint (001), but it's the signature page, which doesn't mention the class action status. So no new info there.\n\nThe next action should be to check if all keys are filled. Since there's only one key and it's filled, the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present in the corpus for that key have been extracted, each with evidence. Or Not Applicable.\"\n\nIn this case, the key is complete with the extracted value. So the next step is to stop.\n\nBut the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled.
