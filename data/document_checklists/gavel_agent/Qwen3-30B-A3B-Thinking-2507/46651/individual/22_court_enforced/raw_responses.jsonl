The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to get the list of documents. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to find out what's available.\n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex can't be used because there are no documents to read or search.

The user needs to extract whether a settlement is court-enforced or not, with specific guidelines. The checklist item is \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\", and they need to answer 'Yes' or 'No' based on the documents.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all 5 documents are unvisited (marked with ○), and the checklist key is empty. The task is to find if any document mentions court enforcement of a settlement. The user mentioned that \"court-enforced\" means the court retains jurisdiction without incorporating the settlement into an order. So, I need to search for phrases like \"court retains jurisdiction\" or similar terms.\n\nThe available documents are Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, and a short Order. The Docket might have procedural info, and the Orders might contain relevant language. Since the documents are unvisited, the next step is to choose a document to read. The Docket is 17k tokens, which is large, but maybe the key info is in the beginning. Alternatively, using a regex search could be efficient to find relevant terms without reading the whole document.\n\nThe checklist item's definition mentions \"Kokkonen retention\" as an example. So, a regex pattern like \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\" might help. Using search_document_regex with that pattern could quickly find the relevant sections. The Docket and Orders are more likely to have such terms than the Complaints, which are usually the initial filings.\n\nWait, the user's example says \"settlement (not entered as an order/judgment)\" so maybe the Opinion and Order document would have the settlement terms. The short Order might also be relevant. But to save time, using regex to search all documents for \"court retains jurisdiction\" would be better than reading each document fully.\n\nSo, the next action should be search_document_regex with the pattern \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\" to find matches across all documents. This will give context around those phrases, which can then be read in detail if needed. The parameters would be pattern set to that regex, doc_name='all', top_k=5, context_tokens=200.

The checklist item is \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\", and they need to answer Yes or No based on the documents.\n\nFirst, the recent actions: they did list_documents and found 5 documents, all unvisited. Then they did a search_document_regex with \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\" across all documents, but got 0 matches. So the regex search didn't find anything. Now, they need to figure out the next step.\n\nThe current status shows that the key is empty, and all documents are unvisited. Since the regex search didn't work, maybe the exact phrases they were looking for aren't present, or they need to check the documents more thoroughly. The next logical step would be to read some documents to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Opinion and Order (12,971 tokens) and the Docket (17,264 tokens) are likely to contain legal terms related to court enforcement. The Complaints might not have the settlement details yet, as settlements are usually part of the resolution. The Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders is very short (81 tokens), so maybe not the best place to start.\n\nSince the regex search failed, maybe they should read the Opinion and Order document first, as it's a key document where court decisions are stated. The Docket might have entries about the settlement, but the Opinion and Order is more likely to have the specific language about court-enforced settlements.\n\nThey should use read_document on the Opinion and Order, starting from the beginning. The document is 12,971 tokens, so reading the whole thing might be too much, but the problem says to read ≤10,000 tokens. Wait, the max is 10,000 tokens per read. The Opinion and Order is 12,971, so they can read the first 10,000 tokens. But maybe the relevant info is in the beginning. Let's say start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all as unvisited, so they need to start reading. Since the regex didn't find anything, perhaps the exact phrases are different. Maybe \"court retains jurisdiction\" was the pattern, but maybe the documents use different wording. So reading the document will help find the actual text.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Opinion and Order\" from 0 to 10000 tokens.

The user needs me to extract whether the settlement is court-enforced from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\", which requires a 'Yes' or 'No' answer based on specific criteria.\n\nLooking at the current status: all keys are empty. The recent actions show they searched for \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\" across all documents but found 0 matches. Then they read the first 10k tokens of \"Opinion and Order\" but didn't find anything related to court enforcement of settlements.\n\nHmm, the document they read is an opinion and order from a case about Job Corps program closures. It's a preliminary injunction motion, not a settlement. The court is discussing whether the DOL's actions violate statutes, but there's no mention of a settlement being court-enforced. The key phrases they searched for (\"court retains jurisdiction\" and \"Kokkonen\") are about court enforcement of settlements, but the document is about injunctions, not settlements.\n\nWait, the document does mention \"Kokkonen\" in the context of jurisdiction? Let me check again. Scanning through the text... no, actually the search came back with 0 matches, so the term \"Kokkonen\" isn't in this document. The document talks about the court retaining jurisdiction for the injunction, but that's different from a settlement being court-enforced.\n\nThe checklist specifically says: \"Answer 'Yes' if the court explicitly retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement without incorporating it into an order or judgment (e.g., Kokkonen retention), and 'No' if it is a private agreement with no retained jurisdiction.\"\n\nSince this is a preliminary injunction case (not a settlement), and there's no settlement mentioned at all, this document doesn't contain the required information. The court isn't enforcing a settlement here - they're granting an injunction to stop the DOL from closing centers.\n\nSo what's next? The document catalog shows 5 documents. They've partially read \"Opinion and Order\" (77% covered), but the key info isn't there. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, and another Order.\n\nThe next logical step is to search for more specific patterns related to settlements. The previous regex search was too broad (\"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\") and found nothing. Maybe they need to look for settlement terms instead. But the user's instructions say: \"Use to jump to likely sections; then confirm with read_document. Prefer precise, anchored patterns tied to document structure.\"\n\nWait, the checklist item is about settlements being court-enforced. So the regex should look for settlement-related terms combined with court enforcement. But since they already tried a broad regex and got nothing, maybe they should try reading another document first.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" is only 81 tokens - probably too short to contain settlement info, but worth checking. However, the main document they need is likely the complaint or docket, which might mention settlement terms.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" - \"Opinion and Order\" is partially visited (only 0-10000 tokens read, but it's 12,971 tokens total, so 77% covered). They should read the remaining tokens (10000-12971) to see if the settlement info appears later.\n\nWait, the current read was tokens 0-10000, and the document is 12,971 tokens. So there's still 2,971 tokens unviewed. According to document reading efficiency rules, they should read the unviewed range (10000-12971) before moving to other documents.\n\nBut the document they read (Opinion and Order) is about a preliminary injunction, not a settlement. Still, they should finish reading it to be thorough. The checklist item is about settlements, so if the document doesn't mention a settlement at all, it's irrelevant, but they need to confirm it's not there.\n\nThe evidence requirements say every extracted value must have evidence, but if they can't find it, they shouldn't make it up. Since the current search found nothing and this document doesn't seem relevant, they should move to other documents.\n\nBut the policy says: \"When you have confirmed text for one or more keys: use append_checklist or update_checklist.\" Since they haven't confirmed any text for this key, they shouldn't call append/update yet.\n\nThe next action should be to read the remaining tokens of \"Opinion and Order\" (since it's partially visited) to make sure they didn't miss anything. But the document is 12,971 tokens, they read 0-10000 (10,000 tokens), so the remaining is 10000-12971 (2,971 tokens). That's under 10,000, so valid to read.\n\nAlternatively, they could search the entire corpus for settlement terms, but the previous regex search was for court enforcement terms and found nothing. Maybe a better regex would be \"settlement\" combined with \"court-enforced\" or \"retains jurisdiction\".\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Avoid broad multi-term OR patterns.\" So a regex like \"settlement.*court-enforced|settlement.*retains jurisdiction\" might be better.\n\nWait, but the user's previous search was \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen\" which is about the jurisdiction retention (Kokkonen is a case about that), but they need to find if the settlement is court-enforced, which would be mentioned in the document.\n\nGiven that the first document they read is the main opinion and order, and it's about injunctions not settlements, it's unlikely to contain settlement info. But to be systematic, they should finish reading it.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on \"Opinion and Order\" for tokens 10000-12971.\n\nWait, the document is 12,971 tokens, so end_token should be 12971. Start_token 10000, end_token 12971.\n\nYes, that's within the 10k max (2971 tokens).\n\nThey shouldn't move to other documents yet because they haven't finished reading the partially visited one.\n\nSo the correct action is to read the remaining tokens of \"Opinion and Order\".\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 12971}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12971}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13810, "completion_tokens": 1434, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Let me scan that text again for any mention of court enforcement of a settlement. The document is an opinion and order granting a preliminary injunction, not a settlement. \n\nLooking through the text:\n- The case involves a motion for preliminary injunction, not a settlement.\n- The court is ordering the defendants to stop closing centers, not enforcing a settlement.\n- There's no mention of \"settlement\" in the document—only \"preliminary injunction,\" \"order,\" and \"injunction.\"\n- The key specifically asks about \"settlement (not entered as an order/judgment)\" being court-enforced.

The \"Opinion and Order\" document doesn't contain any language about a settlement being court-enforced. The court's order is an injunction, not a settlement.\n\nSince the document is fully read and no evidence exists for this key, and the case doesn't involve a settlement (it's a preliminary injunction case), the correct action is to mark this key as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence. \n\nThe evidence for \"Not Applicable\" should be the absence of any settlement language. The document explicitly discusses a preliminary injunction, not a settlement. The court's order is an injunction, not a settlement enforcement. \n\nSo I need to use `update_checklist` to set this key to \"Not Applicable\" with the evidence from the document. The evidence should cite the text showing no settlement was mentioned, only the injunction.\n\nLooking at the document: \n- The motion is for \"preliminary injunction\" (Dkt.

The evidence points mention a motion for preliminary injunction, the court's jurisdiction, and granting the injunction. But none of these mention a settlement being court-enforced. The case is about a preliminary injunction to stop the closure of Job Corps centers, not a settlement agreement. The court is issuing an injunction, not enforcing a settlement.
