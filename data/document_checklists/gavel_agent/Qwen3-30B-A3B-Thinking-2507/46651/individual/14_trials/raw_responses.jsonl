The user is trying to extract trial information from legal documents, but the current status shows there are 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Trials\" is empty, and all the documents are unknown.\n\nHmm, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the system says \"No documents discovered yet,\" the next logical action should be to list the documents. The available tools include `list_documents`, which is used to get all documents with their metadata. Without knowing the documents, I can't proceed to read or search them.\n\nThe user's task requires extracting from documents, but there are none listed. So the correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover what's in the corpus. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` wouldn't work because there are no documents to read or search. The system says the document catalog is unknown, so per the Decision Policy, if the catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`.\n\nI should make sure not to make any assumptions. The current state clearly states \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So the only possible first action is to list the documents. No other functions are applicable here. Let me check the tools again to confirm. Yes, `list_documents` is the correct first step.

The user needs to extract trial information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, and a short Order granting TRO. The Docket is the most likely place to find trial info since dockets usually list court dates, hearings, etc. The other documents might have some details, but the Docket is the primary source.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, so no values extracted yet. The next step should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, I need to read it. The Docket has 17,264 tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read the whole thing at once. But the instructions say to read a targeted window ≤10k tokens. Maybe start with the beginning where trial dates might be listed.\n\nWait, the problem says to use read_document for targeted windows. Since the Docket is the most relevant, I'll choose to read the first 10k tokens of the Docket. The document name is \"Docket\", so I'll set start_token to 0 and end_token to 10000. That way, I can check the initial part of the docket for any trial-related entries. If there's nothing, I might need to read another segment, but for now, this is the logical first step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3254, "completion_tokens": 363, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 3, "run_id": "994f7631-542c-401b-9be9-64e2f29bfc5b", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T12:48:29.532271-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Trials\" from the legal documents provided. The checklist item is \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\"\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Trials\" key is empty, and the only document partially visited is the Docket (tokens 0-10000). The Docket entry has a lot of entries, so I need to check if there's any mention of trials, hearings, or related rulings.\n\nIn the Docket entries, I see entry 21: \"Set/Reset Deadlines as to 5 EMERGENCY MOTION... Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM...\" and then entry 23 is the ORDER GRANTING TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER with a hearing date. Also, entry 53 mentions a hearing scheduled for June 17, 2025, and entry 54 is the extension of the TRO after the hearing.\n\nThe key here is that the hearing on June 17, 2025, is a trial-related proceeding. The temporary restraining order (TRO) hearing is part of the trial process. The Docket entry 53 states: \"Minute Entry for proceedings held before Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr: Order to Show Cause Hearing for Preliminary Injunction held on 6/17/2025.\" This is a trial proceeding.\n\nSo, the evidence for the Trials checklist item should include the hearing date, location, and outcome (extension of TRO). The relevant text is in Docket entries 21, 53, and 54.\n\nI need to extract the trial information. The checklist requires every distinct value, so the hearing date (June 17, 2025), location (Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007), and the outcome (TRO extended until June 25, 2025) are all part of the trials information.\n\nSince the Docket document has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), and the relevant entries (21, 53, 54) are within that range, I can use append_checklist to add these values. Each value needs evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n\n- Entry 21: \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\"\n\n- Entry 53: \"Minute Entry for proceedings held before Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr: Order to Show Cause Hearing for Preliminary Injunction held on 6/17/2025.\"\n\n- Entry 54: \"As discussed at the hearing, the TRO granted on June 4, 2025 is hereby extended until and including June 25, 2025.\"\n\nSo, the extracted values would be:\n\n1. Hearing date: 2025-06-17\n2. Location: Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007\n3. Outcome: TRO extended to 2025-06-25\n\nEach needs to be a separate entry with evidence. Wait, the checklist says \"every distinct value,\" so each piece of information (date, location, outcome) should be a separate entry under Trials. But the checklist item is \"Trials\" as a single key, so the extracted list will have multiple entries for that key.\n\nWait, the requirement says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So the Trials key's extracted list should have each distinct value, like the hearing date, location, outcome, etc.\n\nBut looking at the example in the tools, each value is a separate entry. So for Trials, the extracted list will have multiple entries, each with their own evidence.\n\nSo, for the hearing date, the value is \"2025-06-17\", evidence is the text from entry 21. For location, value is \"Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007\", evidence from entry 21. For outcome, value is \"TRO extended to 2025-06-25\", evidence from entry 54.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Trials\", which is a general category. The user wants all information about trials, so each specific detail (date, location, outcome) should be separate entries under Trials. But the problem is that the checklist item is singular (\"Trials\"), but the instructions say \"every distinct value\". So each distinct fact related to the trial should be a separate entry.\n\nSo, for example, the hearing date is one value, the location is another, the outcome is another. Each of these would be a separate entry in the extracted list for the Trials key.\n\nTherefore, I need to create three entries for the Trials key.\n\nNow, checking the Docket document: the entries are within the tokens read (0-10000), so I can use append_checklist to add these.\n\nEach entry must have evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nSource document is \"Docket\", location can be the entry number (e.g., \"Docket Entry 21\") or the exact part. The example in the problem statement uses \"page, section, docket entry\", so \"Docket Entry 21\" is acceptable.\n\nSo for the hearing date:\n\n- value: \"2025-06-17\"\n- evidence: text from entry 21, source: Docket, location: Docket Entry 21\n\nSimilarly for location and outcome.\n\nWait, entry 21 says \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" So the date and location are both in entry 21. But the checklist item is \"Trials\", which includes scheduling (date, time, location), so the date and location are two separate values under Trials.\n\nWait, but the user says \"every distinct value\", so \"2025-06-17\" is a value, \"Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007\" is another value, and \"TRO extended to 2025-06-25\" is a third value.\n\nSo three entries.\n\nNow, the next step is to append these to the checklist under Trials.\n\nThe current status shows Trials is empty, so using append_checklist to add these entries.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with three entries.\n\nBut the append_checklist function allows appending multiple entries for the same key. So in the patch, key is \"Trials\", and extracted has three entries.\n\nEach entry needs evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nFor the first entry (date):\n\n- value: \"2025-06-17\"\n- evidence: [{\"text\": \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 21\"}]\n\nSimilarly, location:\n\n- value: \"Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007\"\n- evidence: same text, location: Docket Entry 21\n\nOutcome:\n\n- value: \"TRO extended to 2025-06-25\"\n- evidence: text from entry 54: \"As discussed at the hearing, the TRO granted on June 4, 2025 is hereby extended until and including June 25, 2025.\" Source: Docket, location: Docket Entry 54.\n\nWait, entry 54 is listed multiple times, but the text is the same. So location would be Docket Entry 54.\n\nSo the three entries:\n\n1. Date: 2025-06-17\n2. Location: Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007\n3. Outcome: TRO extended to 2025-06-25\n\nEach with their evidence.\n\nNow, the next action is to call append_checklist with these three entries under the Trials key.\n\nSo the JSON should have patch: [{\"key\": \"Trials\", \"extracted\": [ {evidence, value}, ... ]}]\n\nEach extracted entry is an object with evidence (array of one object) and value.\n\nSo, the tool call is append_checklist with the patch containing the Trials key and the three extracted entries.\n\nI need to make sure the evidence is correctly formatted. The evidence field is an array of evidence objects, each with text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for each value, the evidence array has one item.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist parameters would be:\n\npatch: [\n  {\n    \"key\": \"Trials\",\n    \"extracted\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"2025-06-17\",\n        \"evidence\": [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L.

The user is working on extracting trial information from legal documents. The checklist item they need to extract is \"Trials\", which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Trials\" key is empty. The recent action was an attempt to append the checklist, but it failed because the patch was missing the \"key\" field. So the main issue now is that they need to correctly structure the append_checklist call.\n\nThe documents available are Docket (partially read), and four others unvisited. The Docket document was read from tokens 0-10000, and the text shows a lot of docket entries. I need to check if there's any trial-related information in that Docket entry.\n\nLooking at the Docket text, there's an entry on 2025-06-04 (entry 21) that says \"Set/Reset Deadlines as to 5 EMERGENCY MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order. MOTION for Preliminary Injunction. (Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.)\". That's a hearing date, which is part of the trial proceedings.\n\nAlso, entry 23 is the Order Granting TRO and Order to Show Cause, which mentions the hearing on 6/17/25. Then entry 53 (June 16) sets the schedule for the hearing on June 17. Entry 54 (June 17) is the order extending the TRO and mentioning the hearing.\n\nSo there's a scheduled hearing on June 17, 2025. That's a key trial proceeding. The evidence should be the specific docket entries mentioning the hearing date, location, and judge.\n\nThe user needs to extract this as a checklist item. The value would be the hearing details. Each entry (21, 53, 54) has parts of the information, but the main scheduled hearing is on 6/17/2025. The evidence should include the text from the docket entries that mention the hearing date and location.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting every distinct value. So the hearing date is one value, but maybe there are multiple entries. However, the key is \"Trials\", so each unique trial-related event. Here, the hearing is a single scheduled event. So the extracted value would be the hearing details.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The source document is Docket, location is the docket entry (e.g., entry 21, 53, 54). The text snippets from those entries should be used.\n\nThe previous append_checklist failed because the \"key\" was missing. So the correct action now is to use append_checklist with the key \"Trials\" and the extracted value. The value should be a list of entries, each with evidence.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with the key \"Trials\" and the extracted value from the Docket entries. The evidence would be the text from entry 21, 53, and 54. Wait, but entry 21 says \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025...\", entry 53 says \"hearing scheduled for June 17, 2025 at 3:30 p.m.\", and entry 54 mentions the hearing. So the main value is the hearing date, location, and court.\n\nEach of these entries can be part of the evidence for the same trial event. But the checklist item is \"Trials\", so the value is the hearing information. So the extracted value would be the hearing details, with evidence from the relevant docket entries.\n\nSo for the append_checklist, the key is \"Trials\", and the extracted value is the hearing date and details. The evidence should include the text from the docket entries where this is mentioned.\n\nLooking at entry 21: \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\"\n\nEntry 53: \"In advance of the hearing scheduled for June 17, 2025 at 3:30 p.m., the Court hereby sets the following schedule...\"\n\nEntry 54: \"the TRO granted on June 4, 2025 is hereby extended until and including June 25, 2025. In addition, the Parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and file a joint status report by June 20, 2025 addressing the redactions made to the exhibits filed in support of Defendants opposition brief (Dkt. 29).\"\n\nWait, entry 54 doesn't mention the hearing date again, but the hearing was on June 17. So the key evidence is from entry 21 and 53.\n\nSo the extracted value for Trials would be the hearing on 6/17/2025 at 3:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\n\nThe evidence would include the text from entry 21 (since it's the first mention of the hearing date) and entry 53 (which confirms the schedule).\n\nBut the checklist says \"every distinct value\", so maybe this is one value with multiple evidence entries.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have key \"Trials\", extracted array with one entry (since it's the same hearing), but multiple evidence items (from different docket entries).\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of objects. So for the same value, multiple evidence sources.\n\nSo the value is \"Hearing scheduled for June 17, 2025 at 3:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\"\n\nThe evidence would be two entries: one from entry 21 and one from entry 53.\n\nEach evidence entry needs text, source_document, location.\n\nSource document is Docket.\n\nLocation could be the docket entry number (e.g., \"Docket Entry 21\", \"Docket Entry 53\").\n\nText would be the relevant snippets.\n\nSo for the first evidence: text is \"Motion Hearing set for 6/17/2025 at 03:30 PM in Courtroom 444, 40 Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\", source_document \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 21\".\n\nSecond evidence: text is \"In advance of the hearing scheduled for June 17, 2025 at 3:30 p.m., the Court hereby sets the following schedule: Plaintiffs Opening Remarks (7 min.); Defendants Opening Remarks (7 min.); Q&A; Plaintiffs Response (4 min.); Defendants Response (4 min.)\", source_document \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 53\".\n\nSo the extracted value would have two evidence entries.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist should have a patch with key \"Trials\" and extracted array containing one value (the hearing details), with two evidence items.\n\nWait, but the value is the same for both evidence entries.
