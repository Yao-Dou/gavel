The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents: there are five, all unvisited. The Docket document is the most likely place to find the filing date, as dockets usually list the initial filing date. The Complaint might have it too, but dockets are more reliable for such dates.\n\nThe user has already done a list_documents, so the catalog is known. No need to call that again. The next step is to read a document. Since the Docket is a standard place for filing dates, I should start with that. The Docket has 17,264 tokens, but the max read is 10,000 tokens. So I'll read the first 10k tokens. The document name is \"Docket\", so the action is read_document with doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the documents are listed as \"Docket\" [Docket], so the doc_name should be \"Docket\". The other documents like Complaint (001) have names with numbers, but the Docket is just \"Docket\". Need to make sure the doc_name matches exactly as in the catalog.\n\nAlso, check if there's a regex pattern that could help, but since the filing date is likely a standard date format (like MM/DD/YYYY), maybe a regex could work. But the instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. However, the user might want to confirm with read_document first. But since the Docket is the most relevant, reading it directly is better. Using regex might be overkill here. So the best action is to read the Docket document's first part.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for \"Docket\" from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3255, "completion_tokens": 453, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are 0 values extracted for Filing_Date. The documents available include Docket, Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and another Order/Opinion. The Docket document has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), and it's the most likely place to find the filing date.\n\nIn the Docket snapshot provided, there's a line: \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Department of Labor. Document filed by Strategix Management, LLC, Adams and Associates, Inc., Transportation Communications Union/IAM, Jocelyn Rivera, Alternate Perspectives, Inc., National Job Corps Association, Education & Training Resources, LLC..(Feldman, Maximillian) (Entered: 06/03/2025)\". \n\nWait, the \"Entered: 06/03/2025\" part seems to be the filing date. But I need to confirm if this is the initial filing. The document mentions \"COMPLAINT\" as the document type, and the \"Entered\" date is 06/03/2025. The checklist definition says Filing_Date is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed. So this date should be the filing date.\n\nThe Docket entry for the Complaint (entry 19) has the date 06/03/2025. The \"Entered\" field here likely indicates when the document was filed. Also, looking at other entries like entry 1, it says \"Filing Fee $405.00, Receipt Number ANYSDC-31175423\" and \"(Entered: 06/03/2025)\". So the date \"06/03/2025\" is the filing date.\n\nI need to make sure this is the correct date. The Docket is the document that lists all filings, so the first entry with the Complaint should be the initial filing. The \"Entered\" date in the complaint entry is the filing date. So the value for Filing_Date should be 2025-06-03.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text would be \"COMPLAINT against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Department of Labor. Document filed by Strategix Management, LLC, ... (Entered: 06/03/2025)\". The source document is \"Docket\", and the location is the specific entry (entry 19) or token range. Since the Docket was read from 0-10000 tokens, and the entry is within that range, the location can be specified as \"Docket Entry 19\" or similar.\n\nWait, the tokens are listed as \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT... (Entered: 06/03/2025)\". So the \"Entered\" date is part of the entry. The actual date format is 06/03/2025, which is June 3, 2025. The checklist requires the calendar date, so it should be formatted as 2025-06-03 or similar. But the evidence should have the exact text from the document.\n\nThe evidence's text should be the verbatim snippet, so \"Entered: 06/03/2025\" as part of the entry. The value would be \"2025-06-03\" (ISO format), but the extracted value's evidence must cite the exact text. So the value is \"06/03/2025\" but the user might expect it in a standard format. However, the instruction says to use the verbatim text. Wait, no: the evidence's text is the verbatim snippet, but the value is the extracted value. The extracted value for Filing_Date should be \"2025-06-03\" (as per the date in the document, but the document has \"06/03/2025\", which is June 3, 2025. The standard ISO format would be 2025-06-03, but the checklist doesn't specify the format. However, the example in the snapshot shows \"2025-06-03\" in the Docket entries. Wait, looking at the Docket entries, the dates are written as \"2025-06-03\" in the first column. For example, \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT...\". So the date in the document is \"2025-06-03\", and the \"Entered\" field says \"06/03/2025\", which is the same date but different format. But the actual filing date is 2025-06-03.\n\nWait, the first column in the Docket entries is the date. For entry 19, it's \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT...\". So the date listed there is 2025-06-03, and the \"Entered\" date is 06/03/2025, which is the same day. So the filing date is 2025-06-03. Therefore, the extracted value should be \"2025-06-03\".\n\nThe evidence text should be the verbatim part where the date appears. So the text would be \"2025-06-03\" from the first column, or the \"Entered: 06/03/2025\" part. But the checklist item is the filing date, which is the date the document was filed, so the \"Entered\" date is the filing date. However, in the Docket, the first column is the date, so that's the filing date. So the value is \"2025-06-03\".\n\nTo confirm, entry 19's first column is 2025-06-03, and the \"Entered\" field also says 06/03/2025. So the date is June 3, 2025. The extracted value should be \"2025-06-03\" as the standard format.\n\nNow, the next step is to use append_checklist to add this value. The evidence needs to include the text, source document, and location. So:\n\n- text: \"2025-06-03\" (from the first column of entry 19)\n- source_document: \"Docket\"\n- location: \"Docket Entry 19\" or \"Tokens 0-10000, line 19\"\n\nBut since the document was read as tokens 0-10000, the location can be \"Docket, Entry 19\" or \"Docket, tokens 0-10000 (entry 19)\".\n\nWait, the Docket entries are listed with numbers (1, 2, 3...), so entry 19 is the 19th entry. The exact text in the document is \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT... (Entered: 06/03/2025)\". So the verbatim text that includes the date is \"2025-06-03\" in the first column. But the evidence's text should be the exact snippet. So the text could be \"2025-06-03\" as part of the entry.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have \"text\": \"2025-06-03\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"Docket Entry 19\".\n\nThe value to extract is \"2025-06-03\", but the document uses \"06/03/2025\" in the Entered field. Wait, the first column is \"2025-06-03\", which is the date the document was entered, so that's the filing date. The Entered date is a different field. So the correct value is 2025-06-03.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is \"2025-06-03\", with evidence from the first column of entry 19.\n\nSo the action is to append this value using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"2025-06-03\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"19 | 2025-06-03 | COMPLAINT against Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Department of Labor.

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done steps 1-3: listed documents, read the Docket document up to token 10,000, and appended the Filing_Date value \"2025-06-03\" from Docket Entry 19.\n\nNow, checking the current status: they have 1 key with 1 value. The checklist only has Filing_Date, so all keys are filled. But wait, the system says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The user found one value, but maybe there are more in other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Docket is partially visited (0-10,000 tokens, 58% coverage). The other documents are unvisited: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and the Order Granting TRO. The Filing_Date should be the date the complaint was filed, which is likely in the Complaint documents. The Docket entry 19 says \"COMPLAINT against Lori Chavez-DeRemer... Document filed by... (Entered: 06/03/2025)\" so that's the date. But maybe the actual Complaint document has the filing date as well, or maybe there's another entry.\n\nWait, the Docket entry shows \"Entered: 06/03/2025\" for the Complaint. The Filing_Date is defined as \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the date in the Docket entry (2025-06-03) is the filing date. But the user needs to confirm if there are other distinct values. However, the Docket entry 19 says \"Entered: 06/03/2025\" which matches the date. The user extracted \"2025-06-03\" from that entry.\n\nNow, the question is: are there other instances of the filing date in other documents? For example, the Complaint documents might have the filing date. But the Docket is the official record, so the filing date should be consistent. However, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value, so if the Complaint document also lists the date, it's the same value. But maybe there's a different date elsewhere.\n\nWait, the Docket has multiple entries with 2025-06-03, like the initial assignment notice, the deficiency notices, etc. But the Filing_Date should be the first filing, which is the Complaint. So the date 2025-06-03 is the correct one. The user already extracted that.\n\nBut the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The checklist only has Filing_Date, so maybe they're done. However, the system says \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" Since there's only one key and it's filled, they should stop. But wait, the user needs to make sure there's no other distinct value. For example, maybe the Complaint document has a different date, but that's unlikely. The Docket is the official record, so the filing date is 2025-06-03.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 19 says \"COMPLAINT... Document filed by... (Entered: 06/03/2025)\". So the date entered is 06/03/2025, which is the filing date. The user extracted \"2025-06-03\", which matches. Are there any other entries with a different filing date? Looking through the Docket entries, all entries from 2025-06-03 have that date, and the first entry (Docket Entry 1) is a notice about a deficient pleading filed on 2025-06-03. The actual Complaint is entry 19. So the filing date is 2025-06-03, and it's the only date.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if there are other documents that might have a different date. The other documents (Complaint 001, 002, etc.) might contain the filing date. However, the Docket is the primary source for the filing date, and the Complaint document would likely reference the same date. But since the task is to extract from all documents, maybe they should check the Complaint documents to ensure there's no discrepancy.\n\nWait, but the user has already extracted the value from the Docket. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was filed. The Docket entry 19 is the Complaint, which is the initial filing. The date there is 2025-06-03. The other documents (like the Complaint PDFs) might have the date in the header, but it's likely the same. However, the user's current status shows that the key is filled, so maybe they don't need to check further. But the system's Stop Criteria says \"stop when all applicable checklist items are fully extracted and any non-applicable items are marked.\"\n\nWait, the checklist only has Filing_Date, and it's already extracted. So they should stop. But the user's recent action was appending the checklist, so the next step is to check if there's more to do. However, the system says \"Stop only when every checklist key is either Complete or Not Applicable.\" Since Filing_Date is complete with one value, they should stop.\n\nBut let's check the current status again. The user has 1 key filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. So all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user might need to confirm that there are no other values. For example, maybe the Complaint document has a different date. But the Docket entry 19 says \"Entered: 06/03/2025\", which is the filing date. The Complaint document's filing date would be the same. If they read the Complaint documents, they'd find the same date, so it's not a distinct value. Therefore, no need to check further.\n\nThe available documents include Complaint (001) and (002), but since the Docket already has the filing date, and the Complaints would just be copies, the date would be the same. So no new distinct values. Hence, the extraction is complete.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Filing_Date) are fully extracted with one distinct value (2025-06-03) from Docket Entry 19.
