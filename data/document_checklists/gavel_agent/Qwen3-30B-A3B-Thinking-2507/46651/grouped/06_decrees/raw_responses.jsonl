The user needs to extract three checklist items from legal documents. The current status shows all keys are empty, and there are five unvisited documents. The task is to start extracting.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain the required information. The checklist items are about decrees, dates, and duration. The \"Opinion and Order\" document probably has the main decree details. The \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders...\" might have some info too, but it's very short (81 tokens), so maybe not the main decree. The Docket might list dates, but the actual terms would be in the Opinion.\n\nSince the \"Opinion and Order\" is a standard document for legal decrees, it's the best place to start. The Complaints might mention terms but are less likely to have the final decree. So, I'll read the first part of the \"Opinion and Order\" document. The token count is 12,971, so reading the first 10,000 tokens makes sense. I'll use read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so no previous tokens viewed. So start at 0, end at 10000. That's within the 10k limit. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. Doc name is \"Opinion and Order\", start 0, end 10000. Yep, that should get the main part of the document where the decree terms are likely to be.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3418, "completion_tokens": 375, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract three specific checklist items from a legal case. Let me first understand what's required.\n\nThe checklist items are:\n1. Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: Substantive obligations imposed by any decree (what defendants must do or refrain from doing)\n2. Dates_of_All_Decrees: Dates decrees were entered, formatted as [date]: [decree]\n3. How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: Duration terms of decrees, formatted as [duration]: [decree]\n\nLooking at the current status, all three keys are empty (0/3 values extracted). The user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Opinion and Order\" document (which is partially visited at 77% coverage). Now I need to figure out what's in that document to extract the required items.\n\nLet me analyze the provided text from \"Opinion and Order\" (pages 1-19):\n\nHmm... the document is a court opinion granting a preliminary injunction. The key parts I should look for are:\n- Any specific orders or decrees issued by the court\n- Dates when these orders were entered\n- Duration terms (how long the injunction lasts)\n\nScanning through the text:\n- On page 18, there's a mention: \"Defendants’ request for an injunction limited to the parties in this action is granted in part. Defendants’ request that Plaintiffs post bond for the injunction is granted. Defendants’ request to stay this proceeding is denied.\"\n- The court grants a preliminary injunction but doesn't specify duration terms in the excerpt provided.\n- The order is dated June 25, 2025 (from the header: \"Filed 06/25/25\").\n- The court also mentions extending a TRO until June 25, 2025 (from page 6: \"At that hearing, the Court extended the TRO until June 25, 2025\").\n\nWait, but the decree here is the preliminary injunction, not a final decree. The checklist asks for \"decrees\" which typically refer to final court orders. The opinion mentions \"Preliminary Injunction\" but doesn't specify the exact terms or duration. \n\nLet me check if there's more about the decree terms:\n- On page 18: \"the Court holds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of this action.\" But doesn't state the decree specifics.\n- Page 19 seems cut off: \"D\" - probably incomplete.\n\nThe document appears to be the opinion granting the preliminary injunction, but the actual decree (the order itself) might be in a separate document. The user has a document called \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause...\" which is only 81 tokens and unvisited. That's probably the actual decree document.\n\nThe current read_document was on \"Opinion and Order\" (which explains the reasoning), but the actual decree order might be in the separate \"Order Granting...\" document. \n\nGiven the current state:\n- The \"Opinion and Order\" document (partially read) doesn't contain the specific decree terms, dates, or duration in a way that matches the checklist requirements.\n- The \"Order Granting...\" document is unvisited and only 81 tokens - likely contains the actual decree.\n\nSo the next logical step is to read that short \"Order Granting...\" document to find the decree details. It's small enough to read in full (81 tokens).\n\nI should call read_document on \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\" with start_token 0 and end_token 81 (since it's only 81 tokens).\n\nThis makes sense because:\n1. The checklist items require specific decree terms\n2. The opinion explains why the injunction was granted but doesn't contain the decree text itself\n3. The \"Order Granting...\" document is likely the actual decree order\n4. It's the smallest unvisited document, so most efficient to read first\n\nAfter reading this document, I should be able to extract:\n- The decree date (probably June 25, 2025 from the header)\n- The decree terms (the actual injunction language)\n- The duration (if specified, though preliminary injunctions often have specific time limits)\n\nSo my next action is to read that specific order document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 81}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 81}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13856, "completion_tokens": 983, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs all three checklist items extracted from the documents. The snapshot shows that the current status has all keys empty, and the documents are partially visited.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents: Opinion and Order was partially read (0-10000 tokens), and the Order Granting TRO was fully read but only 81 tokens. The other three documents (Complaint 001, Complaint 002, Docket) are unvisited. \n\nThe checklist items are:\n1. Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: Substantive obligations from decrees.\n2. Dates_of_All_Decrees: Dates of decrees with corresponding decree.\n3. How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: Duration terms of decrees.\n\nFrom the Opinion and Order document (which was read up to 10,000 tokens), I need to check if any of these items are present. The document is an opinion and order granting a preliminary injunction. The key part here is the \"ORDER\" section. The text provided in Step 4 (Opinion and Order) mentions the court granting the preliminary injunction but doesn't specify the exact terms of the decree. The main body talks about the decision but not the specific obligations imposed. \n\nLooking at the text: \"the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted. Defendants’ request for an injunction limited to the parties in this action is granted in part. Defendants’ request that Plaintiffs post bond for the injunction is granted. Defendants’ request to stay this proceeding is denied.\" But this is the conclusion, not the detailed decree terms. The actual decree terms might be in the Order section, which might be in the later tokens not yet read (since only 0-10000 tokens were read, and the document has 12,971 tokens). \n\nHowever, the current read only went up to page 19 (tokens 0-10000), and the document is 12,971 tokens. So there's more to read. But the next step is to decide whether to read more of the Opinion and Order or move to another document. The Order Granting TRO (Document 23) was fully read (81 tokens) but it's just a short order, likely not containing detailed decree terms.\n\nThe Docket might have the decree dates, but the Docket is unvisited. The Complaints might have references to prior orders, but the main decree is probably in the Opinion and Order.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Decrees\" in the checklist. In legal terms, a decree is a court order. The Opinion and Order document is the court's order, so the decree terms should be in that document. The current read (0-10000 tokens) ends on page 19, but the document is 12,971 tokens. So the decree terms might be in the remaining tokens (10000-12971). Therefore, the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens of the Opinion and Order to find the decree terms.\n\nThe document is marked as Partially Visited (77% coverage), so reading the unvisited tokens (10000-12971) is allowed. The maximum per call is 10,000 tokens, but the remaining is about 2971 tokens, which is under 10k. So using read_document on Opinion and Order from 10000 to 12971.\n\nThe other documents (Complaints, Docket) might have related info, but the decree is most likely in the Opinion and Order. So the next action should be read_document for the remaining tokens of Opinion and Order.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Opinion and Order\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 12971}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12971}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14034, "completion_tokens": 837, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs all three checklist items extracted from the documents, and I'm supposed to be a document extraction specialist. The current status shows all three keys are empty: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. The corpus has 5 documents, but two are fully visited (Opinion and Order, and Order Granting TRO), while three are unvisited (Complaint 001, Complaint 002, Docket).\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any relevant information in the already read documents. The Opinion and Order (tokens 0-12971) was read in two parts, and the TRO order was read in full. Let me scan through the provided text for the Opinion and Order to see if any of the checklist items are mentioned.\n\nLooking at the Opinion and Order, there's a section titled \"CONCLUSION\" where the court orders: \"It is further ORDERED that Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in concert or participation with Defendants are ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025; from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\"\n\nSo, the injunction terms here are \"ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers\" and \"from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\" That seems to be the significant terms of the decree. So for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, the value would be those obligations.\n\nAlso, the date mentioned is June 25, 2025, in the order. The order is dated June 25, 2025. So Dates_of_All_Decrees should include \"June 25, 2025: [the decree mentioned in the order]\". But the format requires \"[date]: [decree]\", so the decree here is the injunction order.\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the order says the injunction is \"nationwide including having full force in the District of Columbia pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025), except that this injunction will not supersede any contrary ruling by that Court or any other federal circuit court or district court outside of this Circuit.\" So the duration is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nWait, but the user's checklist requires the duration to be formatted as \"[duration]: [decree]\". So the duration here is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\", and the decree is the injunction itself. But the example might need to be phrased as \"until the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\".\n\nSo, for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the value would be \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025): the nationwide injunction\".\n\nBut I need to check if there are other decrees. The Opinion and Order is the main decree here, as it's the court's order granting the injunction. The TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) was granted earlier on June 4, 2025, but the user's checklist is about decrees, which probably refers to the final order. The TRO is a temporary order, not a decree. The decree here is the Opinion and Order from June 25, 2025.\n\nSo, for Dates_of_All_Decrees, the date is June 25, 2025, and the decree is the injunction order. So the value would be \"June 25, 2025: the nationwide injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing the closure of private Job Corps centers, etc.\"\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be cited with text, source document, and location. The text from the Opinion and Order, page 24-25, where the order is stated.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, the evidence is the injunction terms: \"ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025; from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\"\n\nFor Dates_of_All_Decrees, the date is June 25, 2025, as stated in the document's header: \"Filed 06/25/25\" and the order date at the end: \"Dated: June 25, 2025\".\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the duration is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025)\", as per the order.\n\nNow, the user has three keys to fill. The document \"Opinion and Order\" has been fully read (12,971 tokens, viewed 0-12971), so I can extract these values from it. The other documents (Complaint 001, 002, Docket) are unvisited, but since the decree is in the Opinion and Order, I don't need to read them unless there's more information. The checklist items are all covered in the Opinion and Order.\n\nSo the next step is to use append_checklist or update_checklist to add these values. Since it's the first extraction for these keys, append_checklist is appropriate. But the checklist keys are empty, so appending the first entries.\n\nWait, the system says: \"append_checklist: add new entries; Do not set Not Applicable via append_checklist.\" So for each key, append the extracted values.\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, the value is a list of terms. The example shows the injunction terms as a single string. So the extracted value would be the entire injunction text as one entry.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo the evidence for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees would be the quoted text from the order, source document \"Opinion and Order\", location \"Page 24, lines 1-5 of the order\".\n\nBut the document is token-based, so location should be token range. The text was read from tokens 0-12971, but the specific quote is in the last part. The exact location in the document might be hard to pin down, but the user provided the text, so I can cite the page numbers as in the document (Page 24-25).\n\nWait, the document shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 57 Filed 06/25/25 Page 24 of 25\" and the text starts with \"It is further ORDERED that Defendants...\". So location can be \"Page 24 of the Opinion and Order\".\n\nSimilarly, the date is in the header: \"Filed 06/25/25\" and \"Dated: June 25, 2025\".\n\nFor How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, the location is the same page.\n\nSo, the next action is to append the three checklist items with their evidence.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted. Cross-reference the text against your checklist definitions to avoid missing relevant values.\"\n\nSince the Opinion and Order was read in full (tokens 0-12971), and the relevant text is there, I should now append the checklist items.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the three keys.\n\nBut the user's current status shows all keys empty, so appending the first values.\n\nLet me structure the evidence:\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Decrees:\n- value: \"ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025; from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\"\n- evidence: text from the document (the quoted part), source_document \"Opinion and Order\", location \"Page 24, lines 1-5 of the order\"\n\nBut the document's page numbers are given, so location can be \"Page 24\" as per the document's header.\n\nSimilarly, Dates_of_All_Decrees:\n- value: \"June 25, 2025: the nationwide injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing the closure of private Job Corps centers\"\n- Wait, the format is [date]: [decree], so the decree is the order itself. The date is June 25, 2025, and the decree is the injunction order. So the value should be \"June 25, 2025: the injunction ordering Defendants to cease closure actions and maintain Job Corps operations.\"\n\nBut the exact wording from the document: the order is dated June 25, 2025, so the date is June 25, 2025, and the decree is the order itself. So the value is \"June 25, 2025: the nationwide injunction granting a preliminary injunction against the closure of private Job Corps centers.\"\n\nBut the user's example in the checklist says: \"The extracted value should be formated as '[date]: [decree].'\", so the decree here is the order's effect.\n\nSimilarly, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025): the nationwide injunction\"\n\nSo the value is \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor, No. 25-cv-1909 (D.D.C. June 18, 2025): the injunction\"\n\nBut the format is \"[duration]: [decree]\", so duration is \"pending the outcome of...\", decree is \"the nationwide injunction\".\n\nNow, to append these to the checklist.\n\nThe tool call should be append_checklist with a patch array containing the three keys.\n\nEach key's extracted list will have one entry (since it's the first value for each key).\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025; from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"It is further ORDERED that Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in concert or participation with Defendants are ENJOINED from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025; from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to eliminate the Job Corps program without Congressional authorization.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 24 of the Opinion and Order\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"June 25, 2025: the nationwide injunction granting a preliminary injunction against the closure of private Job Corps centers\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Dated: June 25, 2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 25, signature line\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 57 Filed 06/25/25\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"Header of the document\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"pending the outcome of Cabrera v.

The user has provided a snapshot of a legal checklist extraction task. The goal is to extract three specific checklist items from the case documents: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, and How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, the assistant has already done several steps. They listed the documents, read parts of the Opinion and Order, and then appended the checklist items with values from that document. The current status shows all three keys have values extracted, with 1 value each from the Opinion and Order document.\n\nThe available documents include two unvisited Complaints (001 and 002) and a Docket. But the checklist items have already been filled. The user's instructions say to stop when all keys are complete or marked Not Applicable. Since all three keys have values with evidence, and the Opinion and Order document is fully visited (100% coverage), there's no need to read other documents.\n\nThe assistant's last action was an append_checklist that successfully added the three keys. The current status shows all keys have values, no empty keys, and no Not Applicable. The documents left unvisited (Complaints and Docket) probably don't contain additional decree terms, dates, or duration info since the main order document already provided the relevant details. The case's main decree is in the Opinion and Order, as seen in the excerpts.\n\nThe system's stop criteria require that all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. Here, all are complete. The evidence for each value is properly cited from the Opinion and Order. The other documents haven't been read, but since the checklist is already filled, there's no need to proceed further. The user's instructions say not to reread visited documents, and the Opinion and Order is fully visited.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop.

The system's automatic `get_checklist` after step 8 confirms 3/3 filled. The user's prior steps show they've extracted the necessary values from the Opinion and Order document, which is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so there's no need to read other documents.\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here since all items are filled. The stop criteria are met: all keys are complete with evidence. The system even says \"stop attempt 1/2\" but since it's the second stop (after the automatic review), it should be valid.
