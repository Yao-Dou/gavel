The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. All keys are empty, and there are 13 unvisited documents. The task is to find the filing date. The Complaint is the most likely document to have the filing date since it's the initial filing. The Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is a better starting point.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" which is marked as unvisited. Since the Complaint is where the case starts, the filing date should be there. I should read a portion of that document. But how much to read? The token count is 77,509, so I need to read a window of up to 10k tokens. Maybe the beginning of the document where the filing date is typically listed.\n\nWait, the system says not to reread visited documents, but all are unvisited. So I can start with the Complaint. The next step is to call read_document on the Complaint, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That should cover the initial part of the document where the filing date is likely mentioned. I need to make sure to use the correct parameters: doc_name as \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex unless there's a clear pattern, but since the filing date is a specific date, maybe the Complaint's header has it. So reading the first 10k tokens of the Complaint is the right move here. That's the most efficient way to get the initial data without unnecessary searches.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3599, "completion_tokens": 432, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Step 3 was append_checklist, which successfully added that value.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value, and all keys are filled.

The other documents are unvisited, but the filing date is typically on the first document, the complaint.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed.\" The complaint is the first document filed, so the filing date should be in the complaint. The evidence from the read shows \"Filed 04/28/25\" on the first page. So that's the correct date.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract every distinct value for Filing_Date. Since the complaint is the initial filing, there's only one filing date. The other documents like the Docket or Orders are subsequent, so they wouldn't have the original filing date.

The next step should be to stop because all values are extracted.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" But the filing date is the same across all documents. The complaint's filed date is the original filing date. Other documents might reference it, but the value would be the same. So there's only one unique value: 04/28/25.
