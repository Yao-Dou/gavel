The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the next step should be. The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information. But right now, the immediate action is to call `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3150, "completion_tokens": 253, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value found.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The checklist specifies that it's for formal court orders like injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments. So, the documents that are court orders or opinions would be the best candidates. Looking at the available documents:\n\n- Complaints (First, Second Amended) are pleadings, probably not where the decree duration would be stated.\n- Declaration of Abigail Doe is an affidavit, maybe supporting evidence but not the decree itself.\n- Docket might have procedural info but not the decree terms.\n- Memorandum Opinion is an order from the court, so this is a strong candidate. It's a 15k token document, so it's probably where the actual court's decree is detailed.\n- Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is a motion, not the final order.\n\nSo the Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is the most promising. The other documents are less likely. The Docket might mention the decree, but the opinion is more detailed. Since the user has to choose one action, reading the Memorandum Opinion makes sense. The document is unvisited, so I should read it.\n\nWait, the system says to use read_document for a targeted window. But the whole document is 15k tokens, and the limit is 10k per read. So I can't read the whole thing in one go. But since it's the most relevant, I'll start with the first part. The start_token should be 0, end_token 10000. That's the maximum allowed. Then, after reading that part, I can check for the decree duration. If not found, maybe read another section. But for now, the first step is to read the document.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for terms like \"decree\", \"duration\", \"injunction\", \"order\", \"for a period of\", etc. But the user said to use regex when it's clearly patternable. The problem is, the regex might be too broad. But maybe a pattern like \"duration of the decree|injunction will last|for a period of\" could work. However, since it's a legal document, the exact phrasing might vary. The Memorandum Opinion is the most likely place, so maybe reading it first is better.\n\nWait, the current state says all documents are unvisited. The user's recent action was list_documents, which found 7 docs. Now, the next step is to pick one to read. The Memorandum Opinion is the most relevant. So I should call read_document on that document, starting at 0, ending at 10000 tokens. That's the standard approach when you don't have a specific pattern but have a high-priority document.\n\nI shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because it's better to read the document first if it's the most likely candidate. So the correct action here is read_document with the Memorandum Opinion, first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3383, "completion_tokens": 707, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of court-ordered decrees like injunctions or consent decrees. The key point here is that it's only for formal court orders, not negotiated agreements.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are no values extracted yet. The only document that's been partially read is the Memorandum Opinion (tokens 0-10000). The user provided that text, so I need to check if there's any mention of decree duration in that document.\n\nScanning through the provided text from the Memorandum Opinion, I don't see any specific mention of a decree's duration. The document is a court opinion denying a preliminary injunction. The court talks about the APA challenges, the Institute's programs, but doesn't mention any specific decree duration. The relief sought was a preliminary injunction, but the court denied it, so there's no decree issued yet. The opinion mentions \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions\" and discusses why the plaintiffs' claims don't meet the criteria, but there's no actual decree with a duration.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited: Complaints, Declarations, Docket, and Motion. Since the Memorandum Opinion didn't have the info, I should check other documents. But the next logical step is to read more of the Memorandum Opinion to see if the duration appears later, since it's only partially read (0-10000 tokens out of 15,044). Wait, the document is 15k tokens, and they read 0-10k, so there's still 5k tokens left. Maybe the decree duration is in the remaining part. But the user's snapshot shows that the current read was tokens 0-10000, and the next action should be to either read more of this document or move to another one.\n\nBut wait, the checklist item is about the decree duration. The Memorandum Opinion is the court's decision denying the injunction, so if there was a decree, it would be in that document. But since the court denied the injunction, there's no decree issued, so maybe it's Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, I can't set it to Not Applicable without explicit evidence. The user's instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable just because it's not found; need explicit text.\n\nWait, the court says \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\" A preliminary injunction is a temporary order, but the duration might be specified in the motion or the order. However, the Memorandum Opinion is the denial, so the actual decree (if any) would be in the order granting the injunction, but since it's denied, there's no decree. But the checklist is about decrees that are ordered by the court. Since the court denied the injunction, there's no decree, so maybe \"Not Applicable\" because no decree was issued. But I need to confirm if the court's opinion mentions that no decree is being issued.\n\nLooking at the text: \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\" So no decree is being issued. But the checklist item is for \"any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". Since the injunction is denied, there's no such order. So the item should be Not Applicable. However, the Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry with \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence would be the court's denial, which states they're denying the injunctions, so no decree is being ordered.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nIn this case, the court denied the injunction, so there is no decree. Therefore, the decree duration doesn't apply. So it's Not Applicable. The evidence would be the court's statement denying the injunctions.\n\nBut the current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. So I need to set it to Not Applicable. However, the next action should be to use update_checklist to set that key to Not Applicable with evidence.\n\nBut wait, the user's Recent Actions show that Step 2 was read_document on Memorandum Opinion (0-10000). The text provided is up to page 18. Let me check if there's any mention of the decree duration in the provided text. Scanning through, I don't see any. The court is denying the injunctions, so no decree is issued. Therefore, the evidence for Not Applicable is the court's denial.\n\nSo the correct action here is to use update_checklist to set How_Long_Decrees_will_Last to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nWait, but the document is partially read. The text provided goes up to page 18, which is part of the 0-10000 tokens. The full document is 15k tokens, so maybe there's more in the remaining tokens. But the court's denial is stated early on. In the text: \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\" So it's clear there's no decree. Therefore, even if there's more text, the fact that the injunction is denied means no decree is issued, so the item is Not Applicable.\n\nThus, the next step is to update the checklist for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last to Not Applicable, using the evidence from the Memorandum Opinion where it states the denial.\n\nSo the action should be update_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", extracted value \"Not Applicable\", and evidence from the document where it says the court denies the injunctions.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Opinion\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2, Line 2\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.", "source_document": "Memorandum Opinion", "location": "Page 2, Line 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13852, "completion_tokens": 1368, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The other documents (Complaints, Motions, etc.) are all unvisited. But since the court already denied the injunctions, it's unlikely any other document would contain a decree duration.
