The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown. Here, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet,\" so I should call list_documents first. That's the only action possible here because there's nothing to read or search without documents.

The user needs to extract the judge's name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. All keys are empty, and there are 7 unvisited documents. The recent action was list_documents, which found 7 documents. So the catalog is known, so no need for list_documents again.\n\nThe next step is to figure out which document is most likely to have the judge's name. In legal cases, the judge's name is often in the court opinion or the docket. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" document seems like the most probable place because that's where a judge's name would typically appear. The Docket might also have it, but opinions are more likely to have the judge's name listed.\n\nThe user mentioned not to include Supreme Court Justices, but since it's a district court case (based on the documents like Complaint and Motion), it's probably a federal district judge. So the Memorandum Opinion is the best bet.\n\nI should use read_document on the Memorandum Opinion. The document has 15,044 tokens, so I'll start from the beginning. The token range should be the first 10,000 tokens since that's the max per call. Wait, but the document is 15k tokens, so reading 0-10000 would be safe. But maybe the judge's name is in the header or early part of the opinion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"Judge\" or \"Hon.\" followed by a name. But the instructions say to use read_document as default, and search is for when the target is patternable. The regex might be efficient, but since the user said to use read_document as default, maybe start with reading the document.\n\nWait, the current action is to choose one action. The available documents are all unvisited. The Memorandum Opinion is the most relevant. So I should read that document's beginning. Let's go with read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" from token 0 to 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3378, "completion_tokens": 494, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the judge's name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", and the requirement is to provide the first and last name if available, otherwise whatever portion is provided. The document provided is the Memorandum Opinion, which is partially visited (tokens 0-10000 read).\n\nLooking through the text of the Memorandum Opinion, I need to find where the judge's name is mentioned. The document starts with \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 27\" and then the court name: \"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\". Then there's the case caption with plaintiffs and defendants. \n\nWait, the judge's name isn't in the case caption. Sometimes in court documents, the judge's name is listed in the header or footer. Let me check the beginning again. The first page shows the case number, document number, filed date, and page. But no judge's name there. \n\nLooking further into the text, the document is titled \"MEMORANDUM OPINION\". The author of the opinion would be the judge. But the text doesn't explicitly state the judge's name. Wait, the case number is \"1:25-cv-00999-TNM\". The \"TNM\" might be the judge's initials. In many courts, the judge's initials are part of the case number. For example, TNM could stand for the judge's initials. But the problem says not to include Supreme Court Justices, and this is a District Court case. \n\nWait, the user instructions say to extract the name if available. If the judge's name isn't explicitly stated, but the case number has initials, should that be considered? The instructions say \"Provide the first and last name if available; otherwise state whatever portion is provided.\" So if the initials are part of the case number, maybe that's the only clue. But the case number is \"1:25-cv-00999-TNM\", where TNM is likely the judge's initials. However, the problem states \"Do not include Supreme Court Justices,\" but this is a District Court, so it's not a Supreme Court Justice. \n\nWait, the user's example says \"if only the last name or only the first name,\" but here we have initials. The case number's \"TNM\" might be the judge's initials. But the task is to extract the judge's name, not the initials. However, if the name isn't explicitly stated, maybe the initials are the only available information. But the instructions say \"the extracted value should be formatted as '[full name].'\", so if we don't have the full name, we can't make it up. The problem states that if the name isn't available, we should state whatever portion is provided. But the initials might not be the name. \n\nWait, looking again at the document, maybe the judge's name is in the header. The first page has \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 27\". The \"TNM\" is probably the judge's initials. But the user's example mentions \"for example, only the last name or only the first name.\" So if the case number's initials are the only clue, perhaps we should extract \"TNM\" as the name? But that's not a name, it's initials. The instructions say \"the extracted value should be formatted as '[full name].'\", so if we don't have the full name, we can't use initials. Wait, but the instructions say \"otherwise state whatever portion is provided.\" So if the document doesn't state the judge's name, but the case number has initials, maybe we should use that. But the problem says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If the judge's name isn't mentioned in the text, then there's no value to extract. \n\nWait, looking through the text again. The document is a Memorandum Opinion. The judge's name is typically at the bottom of the opinion. Let me check the end of the text provided. The text given ends at page 18, but the document is 27 pages. However, the user provided up to page 18. In the text, there's no mention of the judge's name. The case caption lists the parties, but not the judge. The case number has \"TNM\", which might stand for the judge, but the document itself doesn't state the judge's name. \n\nSo, in the absence of the judge's name being explicitly stated in the text, the value would be \"Not Applicable\"? But the instructions say \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So if the document doesn't mention the judge's name, but the case number has \"TNM\", is that sufficient? \n\nWait, in legal documents, the judge's name is sometimes included in the case caption. For example, \"United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Case No. 1:25-cv-00999-TNM, [Judge's Name]\". But in the provided text, the case caption is:\n\n\"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 27\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n    \nASSOCIATION FOR EDUCATION     \nFINANCE AND POLICY, INC., et al.,   \n      \nPlaintiffs,   \n     Case No. 1:25-cv-00999 (TNM) \nv.          \n    \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official \ncapacity as Secretary of Education, et al., \n    \nDefendants. \nNATIONAL ACADEMY OF     \nEDUCATION, et al.,   \n      \nPlaintiffs,   \n     Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM) \nv.          \n    \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, et al., \n    \nDefendants.\"\n\nHere, the case number is listed as (TNM), which is likely the judge's initials. But the document itself doesn't state the judge's full name. The problem requires the extracted value to be the judge's name. If the name isn't in the document, then we can't extract it. However, the \"TNM\" in the case number is the only clue. But according to the instructions, we need explicit text. The case number's \"TNM\" is part of the case identifier, not the judge's name. So perhaps the judge's name isn't present in the document. \n\nWait, but in the case caption, the judge's name might be listed in the court's header. For example, sometimes the judge's name is on the top of the document. But in the provided text, the top has \"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\", but no judge's name. The case number is \"1:25-cv-00999-TNM\", where TNM is the judge's initials. However, the instructions say to extract the name, not the initials. So if the document doesn't state the judge's name, then we can't extract it. Therefore, the value for \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" would be Not Applicable. But the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit text or dispositive evidence. \n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Do not include Supreme Court Justices.\" This is a District Court, so not Supreme Court. But the key is whether the judge's name is mentioned. If it's not mentioned, then the item is empty. But the user's instructions for Not Applicable say \"require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable)\". So if the document doesn't mention the judge's name, but the case number has initials, is that considered \"explicit text\"? Probably not. The case number is a reference, not the judge's name. \n\nWait, in some courts, the judge's name is abbreviated in the case number. For example, \"TNM\" might stand for \"T. N. M.\" as the judge's initials. But the document itself doesn't state that. So the only evidence would be the case number. However, the instructions require evidence from the document. So the case number's \"TNM\" could be cited as evidence. But the extracted value should be the name, not the initials. If the document doesn't provide the name, we can't assume it's \"T. N. M.\" So perhaps there's no value to extract here, and the key remains empty. But the task is to extract all checklist items specified. If the judge's name isn't in the document, then the key should be marked as Not Applicable. \n\nWait, but the instructions say \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value\". So we need to have evidence that the item is not applicable. For example, if the document says \"This case is assigned to Judge Smith\", but if it's not stated, we can't assume. So in this case, since the judge's name isn't mentioned in the document, we can't extract it, and we shouldn't mark it as Not Applicable yet. We might need to check other documents. \n\nBut the user has provided only the Memorandum Opinion (partially read), and other documents are unvisited. The next step would be to read other documents. However, the user's current action is to process the given snapshot. The Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), and the next step is to decide the next action. \n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so the key is empty. The user has read the Memorandum Opinion up to token 10000, but didn't find the judge's name. So the next action should be to read another document. The available documents include the Complaint, Amended Complaints, Declaration, Docket, and Motion. \n\nThe Docket might have the judge's name. Dockets often list the judge assigned to the case. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document. The Docket has 4,196 tokens, which is less than 10,000, so we can read the entire document. \n\nTherefore, the next action should be `read_document` on the Docket document (tokens 0-4196). That's the best bet to find the judge's name, as dockets typically list the judge's name.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4196}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4196}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13847, "completion_tokens": 2382, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the judge's name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". So far, in the recent actions, they've read the Memorandum Opinion and the Docket.\n\nLooking at the Docket document, which was fully visited (tokens 0-4196), there's a line that says \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" That's in the Docket entry on 2025-04-07. Also, in the Memorandum Opinion, it's mentioned that the opinion was signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/25. So the judge's name is Trevor N. McFadden.\n\nWait, the checklist requires the first and last name. The Docket says \"Judge Trevor N. McFadden\", and the Memorandum Opinion is signed by \"Judge Trevor N. McFadden\". So the full name is Trevor N. McFadden. But the requirement says to provide first and last name. So Trevor is the first name, McFadden is the last. The middle initial N. might be part of it, but the checklist says \"first and last name\", so maybe just Trevor McFadden? Wait, but the standard way is to include the full name as given. The document says \"Trevor N. McFadden\", so the extracted value should be \"Trevor N. McFadden\" as per the document. But the checklist says \"formatted as '[full name].'\", so probably include the middle initial if present.\n\nLooking at the Docket entry: \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" So the name is Trevor N. McFadden. The Memorandum Opinion is signed by \"Judge Trevor N. McFadden\". So the extracted value should be \"Trevor N. McFadden\".\n\nNow, evidence: for the Docket, the specific line is \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" And for the Memorandum Opinion, the signature line says \"Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/25.\" So both documents have the name. But since the Docket was fully read, and the Memorandum Opinion was partially read (only up to 10k tokens), but the name appears in the Docket which is fully visited.\n\nThe user needs to append the extracted value. So the value is \"Trevor N. McFadden\", with evidence from both documents. Wait, but the Docket has it, and the Memorandum Opinion also has it. But since the Docket is fully visited, the evidence from Docket is sufficient. The Memorandum Opinion's signature line would also have it, but since the Docket already confirms it, maybe just use the Docket as evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist requires evidence for each extracted value. So for the extracted value \"Trevor N. McFadden\", the evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nSo from Docket: the line \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" (token 0-4196, but since it's fully visited, location can be \"Docket, entry 2025-04-07\"). The Memorandum Opinion has \"Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/25.\" which is in the document, but since the Docket already has it, maybe the Docket is enough. However, the user should include all evidence sources. But the problem says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So for each value, the evidence should have the text, source, location.\n\nBut the value is the same across both documents. So the extracted value \"Trevor N. McFadden\" can have evidence from both documents. Wait, but the checklist item allows multiple values, but in this case, it's the same name. So maybe one entry with evidence from both documents.\n\nWait, the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same name appears in multiple documents, it's still one distinct value. So the extracted list should have one entry with the value \"Trevor N. McFadden\", and the evidence should include both the Docket line and the Memorandum Opinion line.\n\nBut the evidence field is an array of evidence objects. So the extracted entry would have two evidence entries: one from Docket, one from Memorandum Opinion.\n\nSo the evidence array would have two items:\n\n1. text: \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"2025-04-07 entry\"\n2. text: \"Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/25.\", source_document: \"Memorandum Opinion\", location: \"Page 25, signature line\"\n\nWait, but the Memorandum Opinion was read up to tokens 0-10000, which is 66% coverage. The signature is likely at the end, but the user read up to 10k tokens. The document's page numbers go up to 27, and the signature is probably on the last page. But the user hasn't read the entire document yet. However, the Docket entry already confirms the judge's name, so maybe it's sufficient to use the Docket as evidence. But the Memorandum Opinion also has it, but since the user hasn't read the full document, they might not have the signature line. Wait, the user read tokens 0-10000, which is 66% of 15k tokens. The document is 15,044 tokens, so 10k is about 66%. The signature line might be in the last part, but since the user hasn't read it, they can't confirm it. However, in the provided snapshot for Step 2, the user read the Memorandum Opinion tokens 0-10000, and the text includes the line \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 27\" and later in the text, the opinion is signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden. Wait, looking back at the Step 2 text, the document starts with the case info, and in the provided text, the last line of the read part is \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions. 1  The Court collectively refers to Plaintiffs in the first case as 'the Association' and Plaintiffs in the second case as 'the Academy.'  The Court also uses the abbreviations 'Assoc.' (Case No. 25-cv-999) and 'Acad.' (Case No. 25-cv-1266) in record citations to distinguish between the two sets of filings. Citations are to CM/ECF pagination where possible.\" So the signature line might be after the text provided. But the user hasn't read beyond that. However, in the Docket, it's explicitly stated.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited and clearly states \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden\", that's sufficient evidence. The Memorandum Opinion's signature line would also confirm it, but since the user hasn't read the full document, they can't use that as evidence. But in the Docket, it's clear. So the evidence should come from the Docket.\n\nWait, in the Docket entry, it's \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" So the source document is Docket, location is \"2025-04-07 entry\" or \"Docket entry dated 2025-04-07\".\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Trevor N. McFadden\", with evidence from Docket.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to append the checklist item with this value. So use append_checklist with the key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" and the extracted value.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", so the key name is that. The extracted value should be \"Trevor N. McFadden\".\n\nWait, the requirement says \"formatted as '[full name].'\", so \"Trevor N. McFadden\" is the full name as given. So the value is \"Trevor N. McFadden\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to have text, source_document, location. So for the Docket:\n\ntext: \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\"\n\nsource_document: \"Docket\"\n\nlocation: \"2025-04-07 entry\" (since the entry date is 2025-04-07, and the line is under that entry)\n\nSo the evidence array has one entry for this value.\n\nWait, but the Docket has multiple entries, but the specific line is in the entry for 2025-04-07. So location is \"Docket entry dated 2025-04-07\".\n\nSo the append_checklist action should have the key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", with extracted containing one entry with that value and evidence.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call append_checklist with the patch.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Trevor N.

Here, the only key is complete with one value, and the evidence is provided.\n\nI should check if there's any reason to look for more values. The checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" But the evidence from Docket clearly states \"Case Assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\" There's no indication of other judges in the documents read so far. The Memorandum Opinion (which was partially read) has the judge's name in the header: \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27\" but it doesn't explicitly state the judge's name in the text provided. The header says \"TNM\" which might be the judge's initials, but the Docket entry explicitly states \"Judge Trevor N. McFadden,\" so that's the confirmed name.\n\nThe system's automatic `get_checklist` shows it's 100% filled. The assistant already appended the value correctly. There's no need to read more documents because:\n- Docket is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited) and already provided the evidence.\n- The Memorandum Opinion was only read up to 10,000 tokens (66% coverage), but the judge's name was already found in the Docket, which is a separate document. The Memorandum Opinion's header mentions \"TNM\" but doesn't explicitly state the judge's name as \"Trevor N. McFadden\" in the text provided. The Docket entry is sufficient evidence.\n\nSince the checklist item is already filled with a valid value and evidence, and there are no empty keys or missing values, the correct action is to stop.\n\nThe stop reason should be concise: \"All checklist items are fully extracted with evidence. The judge's name 'Trevor N. McFadden' was extracted from the Docket with verbatim evidence.\"\n\nNo further actions are needed. The assistant should return the stop decision in JSON format.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.
