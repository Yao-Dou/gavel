The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there's no documents listed, I can't proceed with reading or searching. So the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The tools mention that if the catalog is unknown, use list_documents. The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so definitely need to list them first. No other actions make sense here because there's nothing to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and it's currently empty. There are 7 unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where decree dates might be. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is a good candidate because court opinions often include entry dates of orders or decrees. The Docket might also have dates, but the Memorandum Opinion is more likely to have the actual decree dates mentioned in the text.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Memorandum Opinion has 15,044 tokens, which is over 10k. But the read_document function allows up to 10k tokens. So I need to read a portion of it. Since it's unvisited, I'll start by reading the first 10k tokens. The start_token should be 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the document is 15k tokens, so reading 0-10000 is safe. The Docket might have dates, but the Memorandum Opinion is more probable for the decree details. Let me check the other documents. The Complaints are pleadings, probably not where the decree dates are. The Declaration is an affidavit, maybe not. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction might mention dates, but the decree itself is more likely in the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nSo the next step is to read the Memorandum Opinion from 0 to 10000 tokens. That's the most promising document. Using read_document with doc_name \"Memorandum Opinion\", start_token 0, end_token 10000. That should get the beginning of the opinion where the decree might be mentioned.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3440, "completion_tokens": 411, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents, specifically the Dates_of_All_Decrees checklist item. The user provided a snapshot of the current status, and the only document partially read so far is the Memorandum Opinion (tokens 0-10000). The checklist is empty, and there are 7 documents in total.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any mention of dates related to decrees in the already read portion. The text provided is from the Memorandum Opinion, which is a court opinion denying a preliminary injunction. The key dates mentioned are the filing dates of the documents (e.g., Filed 06/03/25), but those are docket dates, not decree dates. The checklist requires decree-related dates like entry dates, modification dates, etc. \n\nLooking through the text, I don't see any specific decree dates. The opinion talks about actions taken by the Department of Education (e.g., February 10, 2025, March 11, March 20), but those are agency actions, not court-issued decrees. The court is denying the injunction, so there's no decree entered here. The document mentions \"executive order\" but that's not a decree from the court. \n\nSince the Memorandum Opinion (the only document partially read) doesn't contain any decree dates, I should check other documents. The next step is to read another document. The most likely candidates for decree dates would be the Complaints, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, or the Docket. The Docket might have dates of court orders, but the current document catalog shows the Docket is unvisited. \n\nWait, the checklist is about decree dates, which are court orders. The Memorandum Opinion is a court opinion, but it's denying the injunction, so no decree was entered. The actual decree would be in the order granting or denying the injunction. However, the Memorandum Opinion here is the court's reasoning, not the decree itself. The decree might be in a separate order, but the document names don't indicate that. The available documents include \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" and the Complaints, but those are filings, not decrees. \n\nWait, the user's checklist says: \"Decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates, for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions.\"\n\nSo, the decree here would be the court's order. The Memorandum Opinion might reference the date when the order was entered, but in the text provided, the only dates mentioned are the filing dates (e.g., Filed 06/03/25) which are the dates the document was filed, not the decree date. The court's decision was issued on June 3, 2025, as per the document header. But the decree (the actual order) might have a different date. However, the document says \"Filed 06/03/25\", which might be the date the opinion was filed, which could be the decree entry date. Wait, but the opinion is denying the injunction, so the decree would be the denial order. So the date the order was entered is June 3, 2025.\n\nWait, the document header says \"Filed 06/03/25\", which is likely the date the Memorandum Opinion was filed, which would be the date of the court's order (the decree). So the decree date here is 06/03/25. But the checklist requires dates formatted as '[date]: [decree event]'. So the event here is the denial of the preliminary injunction, which is a decree.\n\nSo, the date 06/03/25 is the decree entry date. The text says \"Filed 06/03/25\" in the header. So that's the date to extract.\n\nBut wait, the user's checklist says \"Decree-related dates\", and the Memorandum Opinion is the court's order, so the filing date of that document is the decree date. So \"06/03/25\" would be the date. The event is the entry of the Memorandum Opinion, which is the court's order denying the injunction.\n\nSo, I should extract that. The evidence would be the document header: \"Filed 06/03/25\" in the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nBut the current status shows that the document was read from tokens 0-10000, which includes the header. So the date is present in the text. Therefore, I need to add this to the checklist.\n\nThe checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees. The value should be \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\". But the user's requirement says to format each date as '[date]: [decree event]'.\n\nLooking at the text, the event is the denial of the injunction, as per the opinion. So the entry would be \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\".\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text is \"Filed 06/03/25\" in the header. The source is \"Memorandum Opinion\", and location is the document header (page 1, as per the text: \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27\").\n\nSo, the extracted value would be:\n\nvalue: \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\"\n\nevidence: text: \"Filed 06/03/25\", source_document: \"Memorandum Opinion\", location: \"Document header (Page 1)\"\n\nWait, but the user's example in the checklist says \"formatted as: [date]: [decree event]\". So the date should be in a standard format. The document uses 06/03/25, which is June 3, 2025. So the date is 06/03/25.\n\nBut the event: the decree is the denial of the injunction, so \"Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\" is the event.\n\nSo, the extracted value is \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\".\n\nNow, since the document was already read (tokens 0-10000), and the date is found, the next action should be to append this to the checklist.\n\nThe checklist key is Dates_of_All_Decrees, which is empty. So we need to use append_checklist to add this entry.\n\nCheck the available tools: append_checklist allows adding new entries. The parameters require a patch with key and extracted list.\n\nSo, the tool call should be append_checklist with patch containing key \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and extracted array with one entry: evidence (text, source, location), value.\n\nThe text evidence is \"Filed 06/03/25\", source is \"Memorandum Opinion\", location is \"Document header (Page 1)\".\n\nWait, the location should be more specific. The text shows \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27\", so the location is \"Document header, Page 1\".\n\nSo the evidence object would be:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"Filed 06/03/25\",\n  \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Opinion\",\n  \"location\": \"Document header (Page 1)\"\n}\n\nValue: \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\"\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the value should include the event.\n\nSo the value is \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\".\n\nNow, the action to take is append_checklist because we have a new value to add.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, so adding this one.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the patch for Dates_of_All_Decrees.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 06/03/25\", \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"location\": \"Document header (Page 1)\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Dates_of_All_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed 06/03/25", "source_document": "Memorandum Opinion", "location": "Document header (Page 1)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13909, "completion_tokens": 1885, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and the user has already extracted one value from the Memorandum Opinion document.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've got one value: \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\" from the document's header. The document is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), and there are other documents unvisited. The next step should be to check if there are more decree dates in other documents.\n\nThe available documents include Complaints, Declarations, Docket, and Motions. The Docket might have dates of orders, like when the decree was entered. The Memorandum Opinion already has the entry date, but maybe the Docket has more details. The Docket is listed as \"Docket [Docket] - 4,196 tokens - ○ Unvisited\", so it's unvisited. Since the current extracted value is from the Memorandum Opinion, the next logical step is to read the Docket document to see if it contains any decree dates.\n\nThe user should use `read_document` on the Docket to check for any decree-related dates. The Docket is a good candidate because dockets often list the dates of court orders, including decrees. The other documents like Complaints and Motions might not have the decree dates, but the Docket is a strong possibility. The Memorandum Opinion already provided one date, but maybe the Docket has additional dates related to the decree, like modification dates or other related entries.\n\nWait, the checklist says to include \"entry dates, modification/amendment dates, suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates\". The Memorandum Opinion's date is the entry date of the opinion denying the injunction. But the decree itself might have been entered earlier. However, the user's extracted value is based on the document header, which is the filing date of the Memorandum Opinion. The actual decree might be in the Docket.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited, so it's safe to read it. The token count is 4,196, which is under 10,000, so reading the entire document is feasible. The user should call `read_document` on \"Docket\" from tokens 0-4196.\n\nNo need for regex search here because the Docket is a specific document likely to contain the decree dates.

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and we need to find every distinct date related to decrees, including entry dates, modifications, etc.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Memorandum Opinion document. The entry was \"06/03/25: Entry of Memorandum Opinion denying preliminary injunction\" based on the document header's \"Filed 06/03/25\".\n\nNow, the next step is to check if there are more dates to extract. The available documents include Docket (fully visited), Memorandum Opinion (partially visited), and others unvisited. The Docket was fully read in Step 4, so no need to revisit that. The Memorandum Opinion has 66% coverage (tokens 0-10000), so maybe there's more info in the remaining tokens. But the user's recent action was reading the Docket, and the next step should be to check other documents.\n\nWait, the Docket document was read, and in the Docket, there's an entry for Document 25: \"25 | 2025-06-03 | MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction... Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\" So the date 06/03/25 is already extracted from the Memorandum Opinion's header. But maybe the Docket has other dates related to decrees. Wait, the checklist is about decree dates, not just filing dates. The Memorandum Opinion is a decree (the court's decision), so the entry date is the decree date.\n\nBut the Docket shows the date when the Memorandum Opinion was filed (06/03/25), which is the same as the extracted value. So that's already covered.\n\nNow, looking at the other documents. The Complaints (First, Second Amended) might have dates, but they're unvisited. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document 6) was filed on 04/17/2025, but that's a motion, not a decree. The Memorandum Opinion is the decree here. The Order Denying the Motion (Document 26) says \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\" So the order was signed on 06/03/25, which matches the Memorandum Opinion date.\n\nWait, the extracted value is from the Memorandum Opinion's header. The Docket also mentions the date 06/03/25 for Document 25. So it's the same date. The key is to make sure all decree dates are captured. The Memorandum Opinion and the Order are both decrees, but they share the same date. So the extracted value is correct.\n\nBut the user's current status shows 1 value, and the Docket is fully visited. The Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (66% coverage). The remaining tokens in Memorandum Opinion (10000-15044) might have more dates. However, the document's content provided in Step 2 (up to page 18) didn't have any other dates related to decrees. The main decree date is the one from the header.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says to include entry dates, modification dates, etc. In the Memorandum Opinion, the only decree mentioned is the denial of the preliminary injunction, which was entered on 06/03/25. The Docket shows the same date. Are there any other decrees in other documents?\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, Document 25 is the Memorandum Opinion (6/3/25), Document 26 is the Order Denying (6/3/25), so same date. The other documents like Complaints (1, 28, 32) are filings but not decrees. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (6) was filed on 04/17/2025, but that's a motion, not a decree. The Order Denying is the decree.\n\nSo the only decree date is 06/03/25. But wait, the checklist says to extract all distinct values. So maybe there's only one value. But let's check if the other documents have more.\n\nThe available documents include \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" (751 tokens). The Motion was filed on 04/17/2025, but it's a motion, not a decree. The decree would be the court's response, which is the Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n\nThe Complaints are filed by plaintiffs, but they're not decrees. The Docket has a \"MINUTE ORDER\" on 04/18/2025, but that's a scheduling order, not a decree. The Decree here is the denial of the motion, which is the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nSo the only decree date is 06/03/25. The current extraction has that one value. But the user's next action is to check if there are more.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading the Docket (tokens 0-4196), which was fully visited. The Docket shows Document 25 and 26 with date 06/03/25, which is the same as the extracted value. So no new dates there.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion has more tokens (15,044 total, 10,000 read), but the text provided in Step 2 (up to page 18) doesn't have any other dates related to decrees. The remaining tokens might not have more decree dates. However, to be thorough, maybe the user should read the remaining tokens of the Memorandum Opinion to confirm.\n\nBut according to the extraction process, after reading a document, you should check if there are more values. The Memorandum Opinion was read partially (0-10000 tokens), so the next step could be to read the next token range (10000-15044) to see if there's more decree dates.\n\nAlternatively, check if the other documents have decree dates. The First Amended Complaint (15,902 tokens) is unvisited. But complaints aren't decrees. The Second Amended Complaint might have similar info. But the decree dates are from the court's orders, not the complaints.\n\nThe Declaration of Abigail Doe is a declaration, not a decree. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction is a motion, not a decree.\n\nSo the only decree date is 06/03/25. The current extraction has that. But to confirm, perhaps the Memorandum Opinion's remaining tokens (10000-15044) need to be read to ensure no other decree dates are present. However, the document's header already has the date, and the body of the opinion discusses the case but doesn't mention other decree dates (like modifications, etc.), since it's a single opinion denying the motion.\n\nThe checklist definition says \"entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates\". In this case, the order is a denial, so entry date is 06/03/25. There's no mention of modifications or other dates in the provided text.\n\nTherefore, there's only one decree date. But the system might need to confirm that no other documents have decree dates. However, the Docket is fully visited, and the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited. The remaining documents (Complaints, Declarations, Motion) are unlikely to contain decree dates, as decrees are court orders, not filings by parties.\n\nWait, the Docket has Document 25 (Memorandum Opinion) and Document 26 (Order Denying), both dated 06/03/25. So same date. So even if the Order is a separate document, it's the same decree date.\n\nThus, the extraction is complete with one value. But the user's current status shows 1 value, and all other documents are either visited or unlikely to have more. The next step would be to stop, but the system says to use get_checklist to verify.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. But the user should check if there are more values. However, based on the documents read, there's only one date. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was reading the Docket (which confirmed the same date), so now they have the same date from two sources (Memorandum Opinion header and Docket entry). But it's the same value, so it's still one unique value.\n\nThe checklist says \"EVERY distinct value\", so duplicates don't count. So only one entry is needed.\n\nTherefore, the system should stop because all applicable checklist items are extracted. The key Dates_of_All_Decrees has one value, and there are no other keys to extract.\n\nBut the system's Stop Criteria say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key is complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's current state shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", which means all keys (only one key) are filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let's check the available documents. The Docket is fully visited, Memorandum Opinion partially visited. But since the decree date is already extracted, and no other documents are likely to have more, it's safe to stop.\n\nThe previous action was reading the Docket (Step 4), which confirmed the date, but the value was already extracted.
