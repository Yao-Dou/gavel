That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet.

The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all 7 documents are unvisited. The task is to find the filing date. The most likely places to find this would be in the Complaint documents, since the initial filing is usually in the complaint. The Docket might also have it, as dockets often list the filing date.\n\nThe user mentioned that the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the first document. The filing date is probably in the caption or the beginning of the complaint. Since the document is unvisited, I should read it. But the document is 14,020 tokens, which is over the 10k limit for a single read. Wait, the policy says to read a targeted window of up to 10k tokens. So I need to choose a start and end token. The beginning of the document is most likely where the filing date is, so I'll start from token 0 and read up to 10,000.\n\nWait, but the document might have the date in the header. Let me check the document names. The first document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Typically, legal complaints have the court, case number, and filing date at the top. So reading the first 10k tokens should capture that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket has the filing date. But the Docket is a separate document, and the complaint is more likely to have the initial filing date. The Docket might list the filing date as well, but the complaint is the primary document for the filing date. So I should start with the first complaint.\n\nThe available actions: since all documents are unvisited, the next logical step is to read_document. The first document is unvisited, so I'll pick that. The start_token is 0, end_token 10000. That's within the 10k limit.\n\nWait, the document is 14,020 tokens, so 0-10000 is a valid range. Then, after reading, I can check if the filing date is there. If not, maybe read another part or check another document. But for now, the first step is to read the first 10k tokens of the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3324, "completion_tokens": 563, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the filing date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents, the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), and the text shows \"Filed 04/04/25\" on the first page. That's a clear candidate for the filing date.\n\nThe checklist item is Filing_Date, which needs the calendar date the lawsuit was filed. The document's header says \"Filed 04/04/25\", which is April 4, 2025. So that's the value to extract.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the only document that might have the filing date. The other documents are unvisited, but the complaint is the first document filed, so it's likely the one with the initial filing date. The Docket might have the same info, but since the complaint already has it, maybe no need to read others yet.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted for Filing_Date. The recent action was reading the complaint up to token 10000, and the evidence is in that text. So the next step should be to append this extracted value using append_checklist.\n\nWait, but the user says \"extract every distinct value\". Since this is the only document read so far and it has the date, this should be the only value. Need to make sure the evidence is correctly cited: the text snippet \"Filed 04/04/25\" from the document's header, source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location is the first page header (tokens 0-10000).\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: must include verbatim text, source document, location. The location can be \"Page 1 of 28\" as per the document's header. The token range is 0-10000, but the actual text is in the header, so location could be \"Page 1\" or \"Document Header\".\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"04/04/25\" (though maybe the format is MM/DD/YY, but the requirement is to take it as is). Wait, the example in the document says \"Filed 04/04/25\", so the value is \"04/04/25\". But in legal contexts, sometimes dates are written as April 4, 2025, but here it's in the document as 04/04/25. The task says to extract the exact value as found, so \"04/04/25\".\n\nNow, the next action should be append_checklist with this value. The checklist key is Filing_Date. The evidence must have text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the evidence entry would be:\n- text: \"Filed 04/04/25\"\n- source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- location: \"Page 1 of 28\"\n\nWait, the document's header says \"Case 1:25-cv-00999     Document 1     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 28\". So the location can be specified as \"Page 1\" or \"Document Header\".\n\nIn the evidence, location should be something specific. Since the text is in the header, \"Document Header\" or \"Page 1\" would be fine. The example in the problem statement used \"Page 1 of 28\", so maybe use that.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"04/04/25\", with evidence as above.\n\nNow, check if there are any other possible values. The other documents might have the same date, but since the complaint is the first document, it's the filing date. The Docket might list it again, but since we already have it from the complaint, we don't need to read others unless instructed. But the task is to extract all distinct values. If the Docket has the same date, it's the same value, so no need to add it again. So one entry is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the Filing_Date key and the extracted value.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions show that Step 2 was read_document on the complaint (tokens 0-10000), and now the assistant needs to process that. So after reading, the next step is to append the checklist item.\n\nSo the correct tool call is append_checklist with the patch containing Filing_Date and the extracted value.\n\nCheck the parameters for append_checklist: the patch is an array of objects with key and extracted (array of entries). Each entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo for this case, the patch would be:\n{\n  \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"04/04/25\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Filed 04/04/25\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 1 of 28\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, the evidence is an array, but each entry has one evidence object. So the evidence array should contain one item here.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with this patch.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited, but since we found the value in the first document, and the task is to extract all distinct values, we don't need to read others unless we need more values. Since this is the only one found so far, and it's the filing date, this should be the only entry.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append the checklist item.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"04/04/25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 04/04/25\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 28\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "04/04/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed 04/04/25", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1 of 28"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13926, "completion_tokens": 1365, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Then in Step 3, they appended that value to the Filing_Date checklist item.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has one value, and all keys are filled. But wait, the task says to extract EVERY distinct value of Filing_Date from any document. So I need to make sure there aren't other documents that might have a different filing date.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens out of 14,020). The other documents are unvisited: First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Declaration, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and Motion. The Docket might have the filing date, but the Complaint already has it. However, sometimes amended complaints might have different dates, but the filing date for the original complaint is what's needed here.\n\nThe checklist item is specifically \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the original filing date is in the Complaint, which they found as 04/04/25. The amended complaints would have their own filing dates, but the first filing is what's required. So even if there are amended complaints, their filing dates aren't the one we need for this checklist item.\n\nBut wait, the Docket might list the original filing date. However, since the Complaint already has it, and the user's previous action successfully extracted it, maybe that's the only value needed. The task says \"every distinct value,\" but since the lawsuit was first filed once, there should be only one filing date.\n\nThe current status shows all keys (only Filing_Date) are filled. The empty keys and Not Applicable are zero. So according to the stop criteria, if all keys are complete, we should stop.\n\nWait, but the user's previous steps already appended the value. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning it's complete. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Checklist Items to Extract is only Filing_Date. The system shows that it's been extracted once. The evidence is from the Complaint document. There's no indication of another filing date in other documents, and the task is to get the first filing date, which is in the Complaint. The other documents might be amendments, but their filing dates aren't relevant here. So the checklist is complete.\n\nThe user's recent actions (Step 1-3) have already handled the extraction.

In that text, I found \"Filed 04/04/25\" on page 1. Then in Step 3, I appended that value to the checklist. Step 4 was a stop attempt, but the system automatically ran get_checklist and now I'm at Step 5.\n\nThe current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value (04/04/25) from the Complaint document. The document catalog shows 7 documents total, but only the Complaint has been partially read (71% coverage). The other 6 documents are unvisited.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Filing_Date\" - the date the lawsuit was first filed. The document I read is the Complaint, which is typically the first filing. The \"Filed\" date in the header is exactly what we need. I found one value, and it's verified with evidence from the document.\n\nThe system says \"All checklist items (Filing_Date) are fully extracted with evidence.\" But let me double-check: is there any chance another document might have a different filing date? For example, amended complaints sometimes have different dates, but the filing date for the original case should be in the initial complaint. The amended complaints would have their own filing dates for the amendments, but the original filing date is what we're after.\n\nThe checklist definition says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the initial complaint's date is the correct one. I don't need to look at amended complaints for this particular item, because they're not the first filing.\n\nThe document catalog shows the Complaint is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but I already found the filing date in the first page. The rest of the document probably doesn't have another filing date. The \"Filed\" date appears only once in the header.\n\nThe system says \"1/1 filled\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 1\". The evidence is solid: verbatim \"Filed 04/04/25\" from page 1 of the Complaint.\n\nI don't see any reason to read more documents. The other documents (Amended Complaints, Declaration, Docket, etc.) might contain the same filing date, but since we only need the original filing date, and it's already confirmed in the initial complaint, there's no need to check others.\n\nThe Not Applicable rule doesn't apply here because we have a clear value. And we can't have multiple distinct values for the filing date - it's a single date for the case.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop, since all checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date (04/04/25) confirmed from Complaint header (Page 1) with verbatim evidence.
