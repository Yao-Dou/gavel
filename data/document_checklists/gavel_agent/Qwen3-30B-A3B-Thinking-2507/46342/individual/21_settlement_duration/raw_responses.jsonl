The task is to extract the settlement duration from the documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which needs to capture the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into court orders.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain this information. The available documents include complaints, declarations, dockets, opinions, and motions. Settlement durations are often mentioned in pleadings or motions, especially in the context of proposed settlements. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might have settlement terms, but I'm not sure. The \"Docket\" might list settlement agreements, but usually, dockets are more about procedural steps. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" could have a settlement order, but the requirement specifies that the settlement shouldn't be part of a court order. So maybe the complaints or motions have the settlement terms before the court gets involved.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the settlement duration should be for agreements not incorporated into court orders. So the court documents like the Memorandum Opinion might have the final order, but the actual settlement terms might be in the motion or complaint. The \"Second Amended Complaint\" might include settlement terms as part of the claims. Let me check the document names again. The Complaints are for declaratory and injunctive relief, which might not include settlement terms. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction could have a settlement proposal, but it's a motion for injunction, not settlement.\n\nWait, maybe the Declaration of Abigail Doe has some details. Declarations often include factual statements, but settlement terms? Not sure. The Docket might list the settlement as part of the case history. For example, if the case was settled, the docket might note the settlement agreement's duration. But the Docket is usually a timeline of events, so maybe the settlement date or terms are mentioned there.\n\nSince the user is asking for the duration, and the key is empty, I need to find where that's mentioned. The best approach is to search for keywords related to settlement duration. The regex pattern should look for terms like \"settlement period\", \"duration\", \"monitoring period\", \"obligations for\", etc. But the problem says to use precise patterns. Maybe look for phrases like \"settlement shall last\" or \"duration of settlement\".\n\nGiven that, using `search_document_regex` with a pattern that targets settlement duration phrases would be efficient. The pattern could be something like r'settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement|monitoring\\s+period' but need to make it specific. Wait, the example in the instructions says to use anchored patterns. Maybe \"settlement duration\" is a common phrase. Let's go with \"settlement duration\" as the pattern. But to be precise, maybe \"settlement period\" or \"duration of settlement\".\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", so the actual text might use phrases like \"the settlement will last for X years\" or \"the settlement period is X months\". So a regex pattern like r'settlement\\s+will\\s+last|settlement\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement' could work. But to avoid too many matches, maybe focus on \"settlement will last\" since the key is phrased that way.\n\nAlternatively, since the user said \"only include settlement obligations not incorporated into court order\", the documents that are not court orders (like motions or complaints) are more likely to have the settlement terms before it's formalized. So maybe the \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" could have a proposed settlement in the motion. The Docket might list the settlement as a case event, but the duration might be in the motion or complaint.\n\nBut to be efficient, using `search_document_regex` with a pattern targeting settlement duration across all documents makes sense. The pattern should be \"settlement duration\" or similar. Let's use \"settlement duration\" as the pattern. The `search_document_regex` function can search all documents (doc_name='all') with that pattern. Then, the top matches will show where the phrase appears, and then I can read the surrounding text to confirm.\n\nSo the next action should be to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"settlement duration\" and doc_name='all' to find where this is mentioned. That way, I can get the context without having to read each document individually. If there are matches, then I can read the specific parts to extract the exact duration values.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"settlement\\\\s+duration|settlement\\\\s+period|duration\\\\s+of\\\\s+settlement\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 3, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 3, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3383, "completion_tokens": 1022, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nFirst, they tried a regex search for \"settlement duration\", \"settlement period\", etc., across all 7 documents, but got zero matches. That's a problem because the search didn't find anything. But maybe the exact phrasing they used isn't present. Maybe the documents use different terms like \"settlement terms\", \"duration of settlement\", or maybe it's mentioned in a different context.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Complaints (three versions), Declaration, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Complaints are likely the main filings, but they might not contain settlement terms since they're complaints. The Memorandum Opinion might have a court order, but the checklist says to exclude anything incorporated into a court order. The Docket might list settlement dates or terms. The Declaration could have details from a witness. The Motion might mention settlement discussions.\n\nSince the regex search didn't work, maybe the term isn't exactly as searched. Maybe the term is \"settlement period\" instead of \"settlement duration\", but the user tried both. Wait, the search pattern was \"settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement\". So they covered those. But maybe the documents use \"settlement term\" or \"settlement timeline\" or other variations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the settlement duration is mentioned in a different part of the document. For example, in the Memorandum Opinion, if the court approved a settlement, but the checklist says to exclude court-ordered settlements. So if the settlement is part of the court order, it's not included. But if it's a separate agreement outside the court order, then it should be extracted.\n\nThe next step would be to read specific documents that are most likely to contain settlement terms. The Docket might list settlement dates or terms. The Declaration might have details. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction might mention settlement discussions. The Complaints might not have it since they're complaints.\n\nSince the regex search failed, maybe they should read the Docket first because docket entries often list settlement-related events. The Docket is 4,196 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is possible. Alternatively, the Memorandum Opinion might have the settlement terms if it's a settlement agreement, but the checklist says to exclude court orders, so if the Memorandum is the court's order approving the settlement, then the duration there is not to be extracted. But if the settlement agreement itself is a separate document, maybe it's in the Complaints or another document.\n\nWait, the available documents don't include a Settlement Agreement. The documents listed are Complaint, Amended Complaints, Declaration, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Motion. So maybe the settlement duration is in the Docket. For example, the Docket might have an entry like \"Settlement agreement filed, duration 2 years.\" So reading the Docket might be the next step.\n\nAlternatively, the Memorandum Opinion could have a section about the settlement, but again, if it's court-ordered, it's excluded. The user needs to check if the settlement is incorporated into the court order. But the checklist says \"only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order\". So if the Memorandum Opinion mentions the settlement terms as part of the order, then it's not to be extracted. But if the settlement was reached outside the court and the opinion just references it, maybe the duration is mentioned.\n\nBut the regex search didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't there. But the user should try reading the Docket first since it's the most likely to have settlement-related entries. The Docket is marked as unvisited, so reading it makes sense.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The start_token is 0, end_token is the full length (4196 tokens). Since it's under 10k, reading the whole thing is okay. Then, after reading, they can look for settlement duration mentions.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4196}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4196}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3432, "completion_tokens": 921, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 listed documents, Step 2 did a regex search for settlement duration terms but found 0 matches. Step 3 read the Docket document, which was fully visited (tokens 0-4196). The Docket text provided is a case timeline with filings, motions, orders, but no mention of settlement duration. The Docket shows motions for preliminary injunction, denials, amendments to complaints, but no settlement terms. So the Docket doesn't have the required info.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents. The Docket is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Complaints (three versions), Declaration of Abigail Doe, Memorandum Opinion, and Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Since the regex search on all documents didn't find anything, maybe the settlement duration is in one of these unvisited documents. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) might have settlement terms if the case settled, but the Docket shows the motion for preliminary injunction was denied (entry 25 and 26), so maybe there's no settlement yet. However, the checklist says to include settlement obligations not in court orders. If the case is still ongoing, maybe there's no settlement, but the user needs to check.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last. So the task is to either find the duration or mark it as Not Applicable. But to mark it as Not Applicable, there needs to be evidence that there's no settlement (e.g., the case is ongoing, no settlement agreement). However, the Docket shows the case is active (with amended complaints, motions), but no settlement mentioned. The Memorandum Opinion (entry 25) denies the preliminary injunction, so the case is still proceeding. If there's no settlement, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But I need to confirm if any of the unvisited documents mention settlement terms.\n\nThe next step is to check the unvisited documents. The most likely places to find settlement duration would be in the Complaints (if they include settlement terms), the Memorandum Opinion (if a settlement was reached), or the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (though that's about injunction, not settlement). The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (751 tokens) might not have settlement details. The Memorandum Opinion (15,044 tokens) is a key document where the court's decision is stated; if there was a settlement, it might be mentioned there. Since the motion was denied, perhaps the case is still active, so no settlement yet.\n\nBut the user needs to check the documents. Since the Docket didn't have it, and the regex search failed, the next logical step is to read a document that might contain the info. The Memorandum Opinion is a good candidate because it's a court order. Wait, the checklist says \"settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order\". So if the settlement was in a court order, it's excluded. But if there's a separate settlement agreement, that would be included. However, if the case is ongoing (as per Docket entries), there might not be a settlement yet. But the user needs to confirm.\n\nWait, the Docket shows entry 25: MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. So the case is still active, no settlement yet. But maybe the Complaints or other documents mention a proposed settlement. However, the Complaints are about seeking injunction, not settlement. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction is about getting an injunction, not settling.\n\nGiven that the regex search on all documents found 0 matches, and the Docket doesn't have it, maybe there's no settlement duration to extract. But the user needs to check the remaining documents to be sure. The next step is to read one of the unvisited documents. The Memorandum Opinion is the most likely to have settlement info if it exists, but since the motion was denied, it's possible there's no settlement. Alternatively, the Second Amended Complaint might have settlement terms, but that's less likely.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" (751 tokens). Maybe that motion mentions settlement terms. But preliminary injunction is about stopping something before trial, not about settlement. However, sometimes motions might reference settlement discussions. But the regex search didn't find anything, so maybe it's not there.\n\nGiven the options, the next action should be to read one of the unvisited documents. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is a key document, so let's choose that. The token count is 15,044, which is over 10,000, but the read_document function allows up to 10,000 tokens. So I should read the first 10,000 tokens of that document. Wait, the document is 15,044 tokens, so reading tokens 0-10,000 would be a valid call.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Declaration of Abigail Doe (2,099 tokens) could have settlement info, but it's a declaration, so maybe not. The Complaints might have settlement terms, but they're about the claims, not settlements. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction is short (751 tokens), so maybe read that first. But the user's instructions say to avoid rereading, but this is the first time reading it.\n\nWait, the user's decision policy says to choose a specific document likely to contain the target value. Since the regex search didn't find anything, but the checklist item is empty, maybe the value is not present, so it should be marked as Not Applicable. However, the system requires explicit evidence for Not Applicable. The problem is, the current state shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", but to set it to Not Applicable, we need to have evidence that there's no settlement. For example, if the case is ongoing with no settlement, but the evidence must be explicit.\n\nLooking back at the Docket, entry 25 says \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". The case is still active (as shown by later entries like the amended complaints), so there's no settlement yet. But the Docket entries don't explicitly state \"no settlement\", so we can't assume that. The system requires explicit evidence. Therefore, the correct step is to check the remaining documents to see if any mention settlement terms. If none do, then mark as Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next action should be to read a document that might contain settlement terms. The Memorandum Opinion is the most likely candidate. So I'll call read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7774, "completion_tokens": 1545, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Step 3 read the Docket (tokens 0-4196), but it's a docket entry with dates and case events, no settlement duration mentioned. Step 4 read the Memorandum Opinion (tokens 0-10000), which is the court's opinion denying a preliminary injunction. The text talks about the Institute's programs being dismantled, but there's no settlement mentioned here. The court denied the motion, so there's no settlement agreement.\n\nLooking at the documents: Docket is fully visited, Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (66% covered). The other documents like Complaints, Declarations, and Motions are unvisited. But the regex search didn't find any matches, so maybe the term isn't in the documents. Wait, the regex pattern was \"settlement\\s+duration|settlement\\s+period|duration\\s+of\\s+settlement\". Maybe the actual term used is different, like \"settlement terms\" or \"settlement period\" without the exact phrasing. But the search came back with 0 matches, so maybe the documents don't contain that term.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted. The only document read so far is the Docket and Memorandum Opinion, which don't mention settlement duration. The Memorandum Opinion is about denying a preliminary injunction, so no settlement occurred. The case is still ongoing, as per the docket entries up to June 2025.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" But in this case, the court denied the injunction, so there's no settlement. The parties didn't settle; the case is proceeding. So maybe the correct action is to mark this as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. The Not Applicable encoding requires using update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" as the value. However, the system says not to mark it as Not Applicable just because you didn't find it. Need explicit evidence. The court denied the motion, so there's no settlement. The case is still active, no settlement agreement. So the evidence would be the court's denial of the injunction, meaning no settlement was reached.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion (Step 4) says \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\" So the case didn't settle; it's going forward. Therefore, there's no settlement duration to extract. So the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract it. Since the documents don't have any settlement duration (because there's no settlement), the correct action is to set it to Not Applicable. The evidence would be the court's denial of the injunction, as that implies no settlement was reached.\n\nSo the next step is to use update_checklist for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the Memorandum Opinion where the court denied the injunction, indicating no settlement.\n\nWait, but the system says to use update_checklist to set Not Applicable. So I need to create a patch with that key and the value \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the document. The evidence should include the text, source document, and location.\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Opinion, the relevant part is \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\" So the evidence would be the text from the opinion stating the denial, source document \"Memorandum Opinion\", location \"Page 2, Paragraph 2\" or similar.\n\nBut in the provided text, the Memorandum Opinion starts with \"MEMORANDUM OPINION\" and the denial is on page 2.

The evidence given is from page 2, paragraph 2: \"Thus, the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions.\"\n\nHmm, but I need to verify if this is truly Not Applicable. The checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" And the key point is \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\"\n\nWait, the case is about a preliminary injunction motion that was denied. The court didn't grant any settlement - they just denied the motion. There's no settlement agreement mentioned anywhere in the documents. The Memorandum Opinion says \"the Court will deny both preliminary injunction motions\" - meaning no settlement was reached, and no settlement terms were established.\n\nThe user's previous action (step 5) already used update_checklist to set this as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the opinion.

The documents show the case is still ongoing with a denied injunction, so no settlement exists yet.\n\nThe key point is: settlement duration would only be relevant if there was an actual settlement agreement. Since the court denied the injunction (meaning no settlement was reached), there's no settlement to have a duration. So \"Not Applicable\" is correct.\n\nI should confirm there's no hidden settlement in the unvisited documents. But the Complaints and Motion are all about the injunction request, not settlement.
