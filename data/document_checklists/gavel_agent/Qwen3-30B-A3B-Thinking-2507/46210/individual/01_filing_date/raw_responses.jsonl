The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the Filing_Date extracted from legal documents. The checklist has one item: Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. All 14 documents are unvisited (marked with ○). The key Filing_Date is empty. So I need to find where the filing date might be. In legal documents, the filing date is often in the complaint or docket.\n\nThe Complaint document (9,952 tokens) is the most likely place to find the initial filing date. The Docket might also have it, but Complaint is the primary source for the start of the case. Since it's unvisited, I should read the Complaint first.\n\nI need to use read_document for the Complaint. The token count is 9,952, so I can read the whole document since it's under 10k tokens. Wait, the max per call is 10k tokens, and the Complaint is 9,952, so reading the entire document is allowed. So start_token 0, end_token 9952.\n\nWait, the tool says start_token inclusive, end_token exclusive. So to read the whole document, start=0, end=9952. That's valid. No need for regex search here since the document is small enough to read entirely.\n\nI should avoid searching first because the document is manageable. So the next action is read_document for Complaint with the full token range.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 9952}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 9952}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3658, "completion_tokens": 358, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the Complaint document, which they've already read from tokens 0-9952. The Complaint has a header that says \"Filed 02/28/23\" on page 1.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the Filing_Date is present in the document they've read. The header line clearly states \"Filed 02/28/23\", so that's the date. The checklist item Filing_Date requires the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed. The document is the Complaint, which is typically the initial filing, so this should be the correct date.\n\nThe current status shows that Filing_Date is empty, so I need to extract it. The evidence should include the exact text snippet, source document, and location. The text is \"Filed 02/28/23\" on the first page. The document is \"Complaint\", and the location is the header on page 1.\n\nSince they've already read the entire Complaint (fully visited), I can use the evidence from that. The next step is to append this value to the checklist. The Filing_Date should have a value of \"02/28/23\" with the evidence as specified.\n\nI should use append_checklist because it's a new entry. The extracted list will have one entry with the value and evidence. I need to make sure the evidence includes the text, source document, and location. The location here would be \"Page 1 of 22\" as per the document header.\n\nNo other documents need to be read because the date is found in the Complaint, which is fully visited.

The task is to extract the filing date from legal documents. The user has already done Steps 1-3. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 14 documents. Step 2 was reading the Complaint document from tokens 0-9952. Step 3 was appending the Filing_Date value from that document.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: they've extracted one value for Filing_Date from the Complaint, which is \"02/28/23\" based on the header. The document catalog shows that Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist item is only Filing_Date, which they've already found in the Complaint.\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract EVERY distinct value. But the Complaint's header says \"Filed 02/28/23\", so that's the filing date. The other documents might have different dates, but the checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing date would be in the Complaint, which is the initial document. The other documents like Docket or Motions might have different dates, but the filing date refers to when the lawsuit was first filed, not subsequent dates.\n\nThe current checklist summary shows 1 key with 1 value. The user needs to confirm if there are any other documents that might have the same filing date or if it's the only one. But since the Complaint is the first document (Document 1), and it's the complaint filed on 02/28/23, that's likely the correct filing date. The other documents are responses or motions that would have later dates, but the filing date of the lawsuit itself is in the Complaint.\n\nThe available documents list shows that Complaint is fully visited. The Docket might have the filing date again, but it's redundant. The user needs to make sure they're not missing another distinct value. However, the task says \"EVERY distinct value,\" so if the filing date is the same across documents, it's still one value. But in this case, the Complaint's header clearly states the date, and other documents like the Docket might list it again, but it's the same value. So appending the same value multiple times isn't necessary; they just need to have it once with evidence.\n\nSince the checklist item is already filled with one value, and there's no indication of another distinct filing date (the lawsuit was filed once), the next step should be to check if all keys are done. The current status shows 1 key with 1 value, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. So all keys are filled. The user should stop.\n\nWait, the stop criteria says to stop when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key Filing_Date is complete with one value. So they should issue a stop decision.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a possibility of another filing date. For example, maybe the complaint was filed on 02/28/23, but there's a different date in another document. However, the task is to extract the filing date of the lawsuit, which is the date the complaint was filed. The Complaint document's header has \"Filed 02/28/23\", so that's the correct date. Other documents might have \"Filed\" dates for their own submissions, but the lawsuit's filing date is in the Complaint. So no other distinct values.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date fully extracted from Complaint (Document 1) with value '02/28/23'.
