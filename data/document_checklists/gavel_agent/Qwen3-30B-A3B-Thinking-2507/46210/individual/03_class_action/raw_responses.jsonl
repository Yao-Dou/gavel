The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want to know if it's a class action or individual plaintiffs with a description.\n\nFirst, I should check the available documents. There are 14 documents listed, all unvisited. The main ones that might have this info are the Complaint, Docket, and any motions related to class actions. The Complaint is usually where the plaintiff states whether it's a class action. The Docket might have case details.\n\nThe user mentioned that the current status has 0 values extracted for that key. So I need to find where the class action status is mentioned. The Complaint is the most likely document to have that information. Since it's unvisited, I should read it first. The Complaint is 9,952 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call. So I'll use read_document on the Complaint starting from token 0 to 9952.\n\nWait, the document says \"Complaint\" [Complaint] - 9,952 tokens. So reading the whole thing in one go is possible. No need for regex search here since the Complaint is the primary document where the class action status would be declared. Using read_document directly makes sense here. I shouldn't use search_document_regex unless I'm looking for a specific pattern, but since the key is straightforward, checking the Complaint first is better.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint document from start to end.

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which requires determining if the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first step was to list all documents (14 found) and then read the Complaint (tokens 0-9952). The Complaint is fully visited, so I can't read it again. Now, I need to check if the Complaint contains any information about the class action status.\n\nScanning through the Complaint text, I see the plaintiff is the United States of America, acting on behalf of the EPA. The case is titled \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. DENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, LLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY PRODUCTS USA, LLC, Defendants.\" There's no mention of a class action. Instead, it's a government lawsuit where the U.S. is suing as the plaintiff. The complaint doesn't reference any individual plaintiffs or a class. \n\nThe key point here is that the U.S. is the sole plaintiff, not a class of individuals. So the status should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\". Wait, but the instruction says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since it's the U.S. government as a single plaintiff, it's individual, not a class. The description would be \"United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\".\n\nI need to confirm if there's any other document that might mention class action. But the current state shows only the Complaint has been read, and it's fully visited. The other documents are unvisited, but the Checklist item is about the plaintiffs' status, which is typically in the Complaint or initial pleading. Since the Complaint doesn't mention a class, it's safe to conclude it's individual plaintiffs.\n\nSo, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\". The evidence is from the Complaint, specifically the caption and the first paragraph where it says \"Plaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General... acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)\".\n\nNow, since the value is found in the already-read Complaint, I should use append_checklist to add this entry. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be the page number or section. The Complaint starts on page 1, so location would be \"Page 1 of 22\" or similar.\n\nWait, the document's header shows \"Case 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN Document 1 Filed 02/28/23 Page 1 of 22\". So the location is \"Page 1\". The relevant text is in the caption and the first paragraph.\n\nSo, the evidence text would be the caption line and the first sentence. Let me check the exact text:\n\n\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \n) \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  Civil Action No.  2:23-cv-735\n) \nv.  ) \n) \nDENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, ) \nLLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY  ) \nPRODUCTS USA, LLC,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n________________________________________________________\"\n\nAnd the first paragraph: \"Plaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), files this Complaint...\"\n\nSo the evidence text can be the caption and that first sentence. The source document is \"Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\".\n\nTherefore, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\".\n\nNow, I need to format this into the append_checklist action. The key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value with evidence.\n\nMake sure to have the evidence as an array of evidence objects with text, source_document, location. The value should be the formatted string.\n\nSo, the extracted entry's value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\".\n\nThe evidence text would be the caption and the first sentence. Let's take a snippet from the Complaint. The exact lines are:\n\n\"Case 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN     Document 1     Filed 02/28/23     Page 1 of 22\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n____________________________________ \n) \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \n) \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  Civil Action No.  2:23-cv-735\n) \nv.  ) \n) \nDENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, ) \nLLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY  ) \nPRODUCTS USA, LLC,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n________________________________________________________ \n\nPlaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), files this Complaint and alleges:\"\n\nSo the evidence text can be the part from \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff,\" up to \"files this Complaint and alleges:\".\n\nBut for brevity, maybe the key lines. The evidence text should be the verbatim snippet. So I'll take the caption and the first sentence.\n\nSo, evidence.text: \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \\n) \\n) \\nPlaintiff,  )  Civil Action No.  2:23-cv-735\\n) \\nv.  ) \\n) \\nDENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, ) \\nLLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY  ) \\nPRODUCTS USA, LLC,  ) \\n) \\nDefendants.  ) \\nPlaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), files this Complaint and alleges:\"\n\nBut maybe just the relevant parts. However, the instruction says \"verbatim snippet\", so including the exact text as in the document.\n\nSource document is \"Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\".\n\nSo, the append_checklist action should have the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" with the extracted value and evidence.\n\nNow, check if there are other possible values. The Complaint doesn't mention a class action, so this is the only entry.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \\n) \\n) \\nPlaintiff,  )  Civil Action No.  2:23-cv-735\\n) \\nv.  ) \\n) \\nDENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, ) \\nLLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY  ) \\nPRODUCTS USA, LLC,  ) \\n) \\nDefendants.  ) \\nPlaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), files this Complaint and alleges:\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 22\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA", "evidence": [{"text": "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \n) \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  Civil Action No.  2:23-cv-735\n) \nv.  ) \n) \nDENKA PERFORMANCE ELASTOMER, ) \nLLC and DUPONT SPECIALTY  ) \nPRODUCTS USA, LLC,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nPlaintiff, the United States of America (“United States”), by authority of the Attorney General of the United States and through the undersigned attorneys, acting at the request of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), files this Complaint and alleges:", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 of 22"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14211, "completion_tokens": 1770, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Complaint document. The value they appended was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\". The evidence they cited is from the Complaint's first page, where the plaintiff is listed as the United States of America.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other documents that might have more information about the class action status. The current state shows that the Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read that again. The other documents are all unvisited (○ Unvisited), like the Docket, Amended Counterclaim, Answer, etc.\n\nBut wait, the checklist item is specifically about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. The current extraction is from the Complaint, which shows the plaintiff is the United States acting on behalf of the EPA. That's individual plaintiffs, not a class action. But maybe other documents, like the Docket or motions, might clarify if it's a class action or not.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions say to extract every distinct value found in any document. The current value is \"Individual\", so I need to check if any other documents mention the class action status. For example, if a motion or brief refers to the case as a class action, that would be a different value. But if all documents confirm it's individual plaintiffs, then there's no need for more entries.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket might have the case type. The Docket is unvisited (24,149 tokens), so maybe it's a good candidate to read. But the Docket usually lists case details like type, so it might confirm whether it's a class action.\n\nWait, the current extraction says \"Individual\", but the checklist requires \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\". The example they used in the extraction was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\". So the key is to check if any document states it's a class action. If the Complaint is filed by the US as a sovereign, it's not a class action. Class actions typically involve a group of plaintiffs represented by a lead plaintiff. Here, it's the US government suing, so it's not a class action. Therefore, the only value should be \"Individual\".\n\nBut the system says to extract every distinct value. So if all documents confirm it's individual, then only one entry. However, maybe some documents might have a different designation. For example, maybe the Docket says \"Class Action\" but the Complaint says individual. But that's unlikely. The Complaint is the initial filing, so the Docket would reflect that.\n\nWait, the current extraction is from the Complaint, which is the initial pleading. The Docket might have the case type. Let me check the document names. The Docket is listed as [Docket], which is likely the docket sheet. The docket might have the case type. So reading the Docket could confirm if it's a class action or not.\n\nBut the user's current step is Step 4, and they've already extracted one value. The next action should be to check if there are more values. Since the Complaint is fully visited, and the Docket is unvisited, maybe reading the Docket would help confirm if there's any mention of class action.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' status. If the Complaint says it's individual, and the Docket confirms it's not a class action, then no new values. However, the user's instructions say to extract every distinct value. If the Docket says it's a class action, then that's a different value. But in the Complaint, it's the US as plaintiff, which is individual, so probably not a class action.\n\nWait, but the Docket might have a case type field. For example, if the case was filed as a class action, the Docket would list it as such. But the Complaint here is a government action under the Clean Air Act, which is typically brought by the government, not as a class action. So it's unlikely to be a class action.\n\nTherefore, the only value is the one already extracted. But to be thorough, maybe check the Docket to confirm. The Docket is unvisited, so using read_document on the Docket might be a good next step.\n\nWait, the system says not to reread fully visited documents, but the Docket is unvisited. So reading the Docket (tokens 0-9952, since it's under 10k) would be appropriate. The Docket is 24,149 tokens, so reading the first 10k tokens (0-10000) might cover the case type.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for \"class action\" or \"class action\" in the Docket. But the Docket is a separate document, so maybe search_document_regex with doc_name='Docket' and pattern 'class action'.\n\nBut the current step is to choose one action. The previous step was appending the checklist based on the Complaint. Now, the next step could be to read the Docket to check for any mention of class action.\n\nWait, but the Docket might not have the class action status. The class action status would be in the pleadings. The Complaint is the first document, so if it's not a class action there, it's probably not. But to be safe, check the Docket.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Docket, tokens 0-10000. That's within the 10k limit.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex on Docket for \"class action\" to see if it's mentioned. But since the Docket is a long document, maybe searching is more efficient. But the user's instructions say to use read_document when the document is likely to contain the target value, and search when it's patternable.\n\nThe target is \"class action\", so a regex search for \"class action\" would be good. Let's use search_document_regex on the Docket document.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Docket\" as [Docket], so doc_name='Docket' and pattern='class action'.\n\nBut the system says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. \"Class action\" is a specific phrase, so regex search is appropriate.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with doc_name='Docket', pattern='class action'.\n\nWait, but the pattern needs to be a regex. So the pattern could be 'class\\s+action' to account for possible spacing. But maybe just 'class action' as a string. Since it's a regex, using 'class action' would match exactly. But to be safe, use 'class[\\\\s]+action'.\n\nBut the user's example in the tools says \"precise, anchored patterns\", so better to use a precise pattern. Let's go with 'class action' as the pattern.\n\nSo the function call would be search_document_regex with doc_name='Docket', pattern='class action'.\n\nThat way, it checks the Docket for any mention of \"class action\". If it's found, then read the context. If not, then proceed.\n\nGiven that the Complaint is already checked and it's not a class action, but to be thorough, searching the Docket makes sense.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"class action\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "class action", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14401, "completion_tokens": 1641, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

But the current value is based on the Complaint.\n\nWait, the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\".

The checklist has only one item: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. The current extracted value is there. The question is, is there any other value to extract?

So if the Complaint is the only document mentioning it, and it's \"Individual\", then that's the only value. So we're done.\n\nBut let's check the current status again. The checklist summary shows 1 key with 1 value, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. So all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the recent actions have already appended the value. The next step is to confirm if there's anything else. The system's stop criteria require that all keys are complete. Since there's only one key and it's filled, the assistant should stop.\n\nThe previous steps used `append_checklist` to add the value. Now, since no other values are found in the other documents (as per the regex searches), and the Complaint is fully read, there's no more to extract. So the next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with valid evidence.

The user is asking me to extract the class action status from legal documents, specifically the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item. \n\nLooking at the current status, I see that the Complaint document (which is fully visited) already provided one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America acting on behalf of the EPA\". The system has done regex searches on Docket and Amended Counterclaim but found zero matches for \"class action\". \n\nHmm, the key thing here is whether there are other documents that might contain relevant information. The available documents show 13 unvisited documents (all marked with ○ Unvisited). But wait - the Complaint was already fully read (✓ Fully Visited), and the regex searches on two other documents came up empty. \n\nI need to check if any of the other documents might have class action information. However, the checklist definition says to extract \"every distinct value\" found. Since the regex searches didn't find any mentions of \"class action\" in Docket and Amended Counterclaim, and those are the only documents searched so far, maybe there are no other entries.\n\nBut let me double-check the process. The system has already:\n- Read the Complaint (which showed individual plaintiffs)\n- Searched Docket and Amended Counterclaim for \"class action\" with no results\n- The other documents are all unvisited, but they're mostly motions and counterclaims. If the case is filed as individual plaintiffs (as per Complaint), it's unlikely other documents would contradict that. \n\nWait - the checklist item specifically says \"a designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs\". The Complaint clearly states \"Plaintiff, United States of America\" (singular), so it's individual plaintiffs. The regex searches for \"class action\" were appropriate to confirm no class action was mentioned elsewhere.\n\nThe system has already verified with `get_checklist` that the key is 1/1 filled. The stop attempt at Step 6 was premature because it didn't check all documents, but the automatic review after Step 6 shows the checklist is fully filled. \n\nNow, for the second stop attempt (this is stop attempt 1/2), I need to decide if we should stop or keep going. Since:\n- The only checklist item has one valid entry with evidence\n- Regex searches on other documents found nothing\n- No other documents have been read that might contradict this\n- The system's automatic review confirms 1/1 filled\n\nI think it's safe to stop now. The \"Not Applicable\" check isn't needed here because the item is filled. The evidence from Complaint is solid - it's the first page showing the plaintiff as the United States acting on behalf of EPA (individual plaintiff, not a class).\n\nNo need to read more documents because:\n- The Complaint already established the plaintiff type\n- Regex searches on key documents (Docket, Amended Counterclaim) showed no class action mentions\n- Other documents are unlikely to change the plaintiff designation (they're motions/counterclaims)\n\nSo the correct action is to stop with the current state. The reason is that the only checklist item is fully extracted with valid evidence from the Complaint, and no other documents contain relevant information as confirmed by searches.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.
