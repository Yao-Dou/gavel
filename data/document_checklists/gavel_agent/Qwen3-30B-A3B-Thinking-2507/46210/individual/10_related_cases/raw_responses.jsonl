The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the legal documents. The checklist item is about finding related cases identified by their case numbers.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents might contain this information. The available documents include a Docket, Complaint, various motions, and a Petition for Review. The Docket is a good place to start because dockets often list related cases. The Docket document is 24,149 tokens and is unvisited.\n\nSince the task is to find case numbers, maybe the Docket has references to related cases. The Docket might mention other case numbers in the \"Related Cases\" section or similar. So, reading the Docket document makes sense. But the Docket is large, so I shouldn't read the whole thing at once. The maximum token range per read is 10,000 tokens. The Docket has 24k tokens, so I'll read the first 10k tokens to see if there's a related cases section.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all documents as unvisited (○ Unvisited). So the first step is to read a document. The Docket seems most promising. Let's use read_document on the Docket, starting at token 0 to 10,000. That's within the limit. The next step after reading would be to check the text for case numbers, then use append_checklist if found.\n\nI shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because the user hasn't specified a pattern, and it's better to read the document first to see if the related cases are mentioned in a predictable section.

The snapshot shows that in the Docket document, there's an entry at number 3: \"Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147.\"\n\nSo, the related case number here is 2:23-cv-147. I need to make sure that's the only one. Let me check the Docket entries again. Entry 3 mentions \"related case(s) 2:23-cv-147.\" There's no other mention of related cases in the provided text. The other entries don't have case numbers like that. For example, entry 1 is the complaint, entry 2 is case assignment, etc. So, the only related case listed is 2:23-cv-147.\n\nThe task is to extract every distinct value. So this is the only one. Now, I need to cite evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is from the Docket document, tokens 0-10000, specifically entry 3. The verbatim text is \"Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147.\"\n\nWait, the location should be specified. Since it's in the Docket entries, maybe the entry number is the location. The entry is listed as \"3 | 2023-03-03 | Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147.\" So the location could be \"Entry 3\" or \"Docket Entry 3.\"\n\nThe document name is \"Docket,\" and the location is the specific entry. The evidence needs to include the text snippet, source document, and location. So the value is \"2:23-cv-147\" with evidence from Docket entry 3.\n\nNow, the checklist key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number.\" The extracted value should be a list with one entry. Since this is the first value, I should use append_checklist to add it. Wait, but the checklist is empty, so appending the first entry is correct. The user's instructions say to use append_checklist for adding new entries. Each entry must have evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nSo the evidence would have:\n- text: \"Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147\"\n- source_document: \"Docket\"\n- location: \"Entry 3\"\n\nThe value is \"2:23-cv-147.\"\n\nI need to structure the append_checklist with the key and the extracted list containing this entry. The key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number,\" and the extracted array has one entry with the evidence and value.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number,\" so the key name is exactly that. The extracted value is \"2:23-cv-147.\"\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist should have a patch with key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" and extracted array containing the evidence and value.\n\nCheck if there are any other related cases. Looking through the Docket entries again: entry 3 mentions 2:23-cv-147. The rest of the entries don't have \"related case\" or similar. For example, entry 9 is about a motion, but no related case number.

They appended that to the checklist. Now, the status shows 1 value extracted, and the Docket document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens out of 24,149). The next step is to check if there are more related cases in the remaining parts of the Docket or other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is the only one partially visited. The rest are unvisited. But since they found a value in the Docket, maybe there are more related cases in the remaining tokens of the Docket. The current read was up to token 10000, but the Docket has 24,149 tokens. So the next logical step is to read the next chunk of the Docket document to check for more related case numbers.\n\nThe user's current action history shows they've already done a read_document on Docket (0-10000). The next step should be to read the next token range of the Docket. Since the document is partially visited, they shouldn't read the same tokens again. The next range would be 10000-20000 (assuming 10,000 tokens per read). Wait, the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens. The Docket's total tokens are 24,149, so after 0-10000, the next would be 10000-20000. Then maybe 20000-24149 if needed.\n\nBut the user needs to check if there are more related cases. The previous entry was in entry 3. Let's check the provided Docket text. The text given ends at entry 87, which is cut off. But the entry 3 mentions \"2:23-cv-147\". Are there other entries that mention related cases? For example, looking through the Docket entries, entry 3 is the only one that says \"Notice of Related Case(s)\". The other entries might reference other case numbers, but the checklist specifically asks for related cases listed by their case codes. So maybe only entry 3 has that.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, they should check the remaining tokens of the Docket. The current read was up to 10000 tokens, but the Docket has 24k tokens. The next step is to read the next 10k tokens (10000-20000) to see if there are more related case mentions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other documents have related cases. But the checklist item is about related cases listed in the documents, so the Docket is the most likely place. The Complaint or other pleadings might reference related cases, but the Docket is the official record. However, since the Docket has more tokens to read, it's efficient to continue there first.\n\nThe user's current status shows that the Docket is partially visited (41% coverage), so the next action should be to read the next token range of Docket. The available documents list Docket as ◐ Partially Visited with viewed tokens 0-10000, so the next read should be from 10000 to 20000 (since 10,000 tokens max per call).\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document on Docket with start_token 10000 and end_token 20000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14047, "completion_tokens": 871, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all distinct case codes. The Docket has been read completely, so there's no more data there. But the other documents might have more related cases.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" from any document. The Docket only had one entry. But maybe other documents like the Complaint, Amended Counterclaim, or other pleadings have related cases mentioned. For example, sometimes in motions or pleadings, they reference other cases.\n\nThe available documents include things like \"Petition for Review\" and \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\", which might have case numbers. But since those are unvisited, I need to check them. However, the user's previous steps only read the Docket. The next logical step is to check other documents for related case numbers.\n\nThe system's policy says to avoid rereading visited documents. Docket is fully visited, so we shouldn't read it again. The next step should be to read another document that's unvisited. But which one? The \"Petition for Review\" is a big document (272k tokens), but we can read a portion. However, the user should pick a document that's most likely to contain related cases. Maybe the \"Petition for Review\" or \"Underlying Decision\" since those might reference other cases.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the related cases might be listed in the docket entries, but the Docket was already read. Wait, the Docket entry 3 says \"Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147\". That's the only one found. But maybe other documents have similar notices. For example, the Complaint might reference related cases. But the Complaint is a separate document.\n\nWait, the user has 14 documents. They've only read the Docket. The other documents are unvisited. To find more related cases, they need to read other documents. The next action should be to read one of the unvisited documents. But which one?\n\nThe \"Petition for Review\" is a large document, but maybe the case code would be in the header or early part. Alternatively, the \"Underlying Decision\" might have the case number. However, the user should start with the most likely candidates. The \"Amended Counterclaim\" or \"Motion for Summary Judgment\" might reference other cases. But since the user has to choose one document to read, maybe start with the \"Petition for Review\" because it's common in legal documents to cite related cases.\n\nBut the system's guidelines say to read a targeted window (≤10k tokens). The \"Petition for Review\" is 272k tokens, so they need to read a portion. However, the user should probably use `read_document` on a specific document, like \"Petition for Review\", starting at token 0. But the user should check if there's a regex pattern that can help find case numbers. Wait, the case numbers are usually in a format like \"2:23-cv-147\", so a regex pattern could be used. But the user hasn't used `search_document_regex` yet. However, the problem says to use `read_document` as the default choice for targeted reading.\n\nWait, the current step is after reading Docket up to 24k tokens. The next step should be to check another document. The user should call `read_document` on one of the unvisited documents. Let's pick \"Petition for Review\" since it's a key document that might list related cases. The document name is \"Petition for Review\", so the action would be `read_document` with doc_name \"Petition for Review\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure they're not rereading a visited document.

The Docket document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so there's no need to read it again.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are other documents that might contain related cases. The available documents include \"Petition for Review\" which is partially visited (only 0-10000 tokens read), and several other unvisited documents. The Petition for Review is a legal document related to the case, so it's possible it might mention other related cases.\n\nThe user's task is to extract every distinct value of \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from any document. The existing value is from the Docket. Now, I need to check if the Petition for Review (which is partially visited) has more related cases.\n\nIn the provided text from the Petition for Review, I need to look for any case numbers or related case references. Scanning through the text, there's a reference to \"No. 24-1135\" in the header of the petition. This is a case number, but it's for the appellate case, not a related case in the lower court. The checklist item is about related matters identified by their case numbers, so this might not be relevant. The Docket entry 3 already listed \"2:23-cv-147\" as a related case.\n\nThe Petition for Review document might not contain other related case numbers. However, since it's partially visited (only 10k tokens read), maybe there's more in the rest of the document. But the user's instructions say not to reread fully visited documents, but this one is partially visited. Wait, the Docket is fully visited, but Petition for Review is partially visited (4% coverage). So, I should read more of it to check for additional related cases.\n\nWait, the Petition for Review's document name is \"Petition for Review\", and the current read was tokens 0-10000. The document has 272,574 tokens, so there's a lot more to read. But the checklist item is about related cases in the corpus, so maybe the Petition mentions other cases. However, in the provided text, the only case number mentioned is \"No. 24-1135\", which is the appellate case itself, not a related lower court case. The existing value \"2:23-cv-147\" is from the Docket, which is the lower court case.\n\nSince the Petition for Review is a document related to this case, it's possible that the appellate case number is listed, but the checklist item is about related cases (like other cases that are related to this one, not the appellate case itself). So the \"2:23-cv-147\" is the related case from the Docket, and the appellate case \"24-1135\" might not be considered a related case in the context of the checklist.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" The Docket entry 3 says \"Notice of Related Case(s) by United States of America of related case(s) 2:23-cv-147\". So that's the only one found so far. The appellate case number is a different case, so it's not a related case in the sense of being another case in the same court or related to this case.\n\nTherefore, there might not be any other related cases to extract. The other documents (Complaint, Amended Counterclaim, etc.) are unvisited, but the Docket has already been fully read and only found one related case. The Petition for Review might not have any other related case numbers.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if the Petition for Review has any other mentions of case numbers. The provided text shows that the Petition is for \"No. 24-1135\", but that's the case number of the appeal, not a related case. So probably no additional values.\n\nThe current status shows that the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" has 1 value. The next step would be to verify if there are any other documents that might contain related cases. However, since the Docket is fully visited and the Petition for Review's relevant part (if any) might not have more, perhaps the extraction is complete.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to extract all applicable checklist items. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The Docket entry 3 has \"2:23-cv-147\" as the related case. The Petition for Review's case number is \"24-1135\", but that's the case itself, not a related case. So it shouldn't be included.\n\nTherefore, the only value extracted is \"2:23-cv-147\", and there are no more values to extract.

Since all keys are filled and there's no need for further extraction (as confirmed by the system's automatic checklist review), the correct action is to stop again.\n\nI need to respond with a JSON that says \"decision\": \"stop\" and a brief reason. The reason should state that all related cases have been extracted from the Docket, and no other related cases were found in the documents. The appellate case (24-1135) is not a related matter but the case itself on appeal, so it's excluded.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All related cases extracted; appellate case 24-1135 is the case itself, not a related matter. Checklist key complete.\"\n}\n\nWait, the system's previous step 7 said \"stop\" but the system automatically ran get_checklist, so this is the second stop attempt. The user needs to confirm again. The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, so stopping is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All related cases extracted from Docket (2:23-cv-147); appellate case 24-1135 is the case itself (not a related matter).
