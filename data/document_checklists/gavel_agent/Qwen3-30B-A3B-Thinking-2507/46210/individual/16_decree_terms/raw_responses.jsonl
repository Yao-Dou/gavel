Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is unknown. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the first step should be to list all available documents.\n\nThe available actions include list_documents, which is the correct first step here.

The user needs to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments. They mentioned not to include terms from settlement agreements unless they're expressly incorporated into the court order.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain the decree terms. The \"Petition for Review\" and \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" are probably the main ones since those often include court orders. The \"Docket\" might have the decree as well, but it's more of a summary. The motions and pleadings might not have the decree itself unless they're part of the order.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Petition for Review\" is 272k tokens and \"Underlying Decision\" is 275k tokens. Those are large, but the user can read up to 10k tokens at a time. Since the checklist is empty, I should start by reading a part of the \"Underlying Decision\" because that's the actual court order from which the petition arises. The \"Petition for Review\" might reference the decree but the actual terms are likely in the underlying decision.\n\nWait, the \"Underlying Decision\" document is named as [Pleading / Motion / Brief], but it's 275k tokens. Maybe it's the court's decision document. The \"Petition for Review\" is probably the appeal, so the decree would be in the lower court's decision, which is the \"Underlying Decision\". So I should start with that.\n\nThe user's recent action was list_documents, which found 14 docs. Now, the next step is to read a document. Since the \"Underlying Decision\" is the most likely to contain the decree terms, I'll choose to read the first part of that document. Let's set start_token to 0 and end_token to 10000 to get the first 10k tokens. That's within the limit. Need to make sure not to read a document already visited, but all are unvisited. So read_document on \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3733, "completion_tokens": 525, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract all the significant terms of decrees from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which requires extracting substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nLooking at the current status, the only document partially read so far is \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" from tokens 0-10000. The user provided the text from that document up to page 9. I need to check if there are any decree terms mentioned here.\n\nScanning through the provided text, the document seems to be a legal filing related to a rule promulgated by the EPA, specifically about emissions standards. The text includes sections about the rule, statutory authority, and amendments to regulations. But I don't see any actual court-ordered decrees or settlement terms. The document is more about the EPA's proposed rule and the legal basis for it, not a court order that includes specific decrees.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract terms from court orders, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments. The \"Underlying Decision\" here is the EPA rule, not a court decree. The petition is from a case challenging the EPA rule, but the document itself is the petition's underlying decision, not a decree.\n\nSo, in the text provided, there are no terms of a decree. The document is discussing the EPA's regulations, not a court order. Therefore, the checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" remains empty. However, the user needs to confirm if there's any decree mentioned. Since the text is about a regulatory rule, not a court decree, it's likely that this document doesn't contain the required terms.\n\nNext steps: Since the current document doesn't have the decree terms, I should check other documents. But the next action should be to read another document. The available documents include others like \"Complaint\", \"Docket\", \"Amended Counterclaim\", etc. However, the user has a lot of documents unvisited. But the policy says to read a targeted document if it's likely to contain the value.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about decree terms, which would be in court orders, not in the EPA rule. The \"Underlying Decision\" here is the EPA's rule, but the actual decree might be in another document, like a court order from the case. The case number is 24-1135, so maybe the court's order is in a different document.\n\nLooking at the document list, there's \"Petition for Review\" which might contain the court's order. But the current document read was the \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\", which is the EPA rule, not the court's decree.\n\nSo, I should check the \"Petition for Review\" document next, as it's likely to contain the court's order. But the user's current action is to process the documents. Since the \"Underlying Decision\" didn't have the terms, the next logical step is to read another document that might contain the decree terms.\n\nThe user's instructions say to choose one action. The available actions are read_document, search_document_regex, etc. Since the decree terms are likely in a court order, the \"Petition for Review\" document is a good candidate. It's a pleading, but might include the court's order.\n\nThe document \"Petition for Review\" is 272,574 tokens, but I can read a window. The previous read was 0-10000. For this new document, I should read the first 10,000 tokens to see if it contains the decree terms.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the \"Petition for Review\" document from tokens 0-10000. That's the most likely place to find the court's decree terms.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Petition for Review\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Petition for Review", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14216, "completion_tokens": 853, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting every distinct value of the substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. The \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" key is empty, and the documents read so far (Underlying Decision and Petition for Review) have been partially read (tokens 0-10000 each). The task is to find terms that are part of court orders, not just settlement agreements unless incorporated into the court's order.\n\nLooking at the documents provided in the snapshot. The Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises (the Federal Register excerpt) and the Petition for Review both contain the EPA's rule details. The key part here is the \"final rule\" sections. For example, in the Federal Register text, there's a section titled \"E. Amendments Addressing NSPS Subparts VV and VVa Reconsideration\" and similar sections discussing specific requirements like emission standards, monitoring, and work practice standards.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says to extract terms that are expressly incorporated into the court's order. The documents here are the EPA rulemaking, not a court decree. The Petition for Review is challenging the EPA rule, so the actual court order (decree) might not be in these documents yet. The \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" refers to the EPA rule, not a court decision. So the actual decree terms might be in a different document, like the court's order granting or denying the petition.\n\nBut the current documents read are the EPA rule (attached as Exhibit A) and the petition. The rule itself is an agency action, not a court decree. The checklist item is about \"decree terms,\" which would be from a court order. So maybe the actual decree isn't in the currently read documents. The user's documents list \"Docket\" and other pleadings, but those haven't been read yet.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that Step 1 was list_documents (found 14 docs), Step 2 read Underlying Decision (tokens 0-10000), Step 3 read Petition for Review (0-10000). The Underlying Decision is the EPA rule, which is the subject of the petition. The court's decree (if any) would be in the court's order, which might be in another document like \"Docket\" or a \"Judgment\" document. But the available documents listed include \"Docket\" (unvisited), which might contain the court's order.\n\nSo the next step is to check if the \"Docket\" document contains the decree terms. The Docket is listed as unvisited (○ Unvisited) with 24,149 tokens. Since the current read documents (Underlying Decision and Petition) don't contain court decrees (they're about the EPA rule), I should read the Docket document to find the court's order.\n\nBut the user's checklist is about \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees,\" which are the terms ordered by the court. The Docket might have the court's order. So the next action should be to read the Docket document. But since the Docket is unvisited, I need to use read_document on it. The maximum token range is 10,000, so reading tokens 0-10000 would be the first chunk.\n\nWait, the available documents show \"Docket\" as unvisited, so I should call read_document on \"Docket\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000. That's the next logical step. The other documents like Complaint or Amended Counterclaim might also have relevant info, but the Docket is the most likely place to find the court's decree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Underlying Decision\" is misnamed, and it's actually the court's decision. But the description says it's the EPA rule. The title \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" refers to the EPA rule, so the court's decision would be in another document.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to read the Docket document to look for the court's decree terms.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24730, "completion_tokens": 940, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is defined as the substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. They shouldn't include terms from settlement agreements unless those terms are expressly incorporated into the court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've read the \"Underlying Decision from Which Petition Arises\" (tokens 0-10000), \"Petition for Review\" (same tokens), and \"Docket\" (tokens 0-10000). The Docket is a case log, so it's probably not where the decree terms are. The Underlying Decision and Petition for Review are the main documents that might contain the decree.\n\nIn the Underlying Decision (page 4-5), there's an \"EXHIBIT A\" which is the rule from the EPA. The rule includes various standards, like for heat exchange systems, process vents, storage vessels, etc. The key part is that the rule is the \"final rule\" that the petition is challenging. But the decree terms would be in the court's order, not the EPA rule itself. Wait, the user mentioned \"consent decrees and stipulated judgments,\" but in this case, it's a petition for review of an EPA rule, not a consent decree. So maybe there's no decree here? But the task says to extract from legal documents, so maybe the court's order in the case is the decree.\n\nWait, the \"Petition for Review\" is from Denka against the EPA. The EPA issued a rule, and Denka is challenging it. The court hasn't made a decree yet; it's a petition for review, so the decree (if any) would be the court's order on the petition. But the documents provided don't include the court's order, only the petition and the EPA rule. The Docket shows the case is ongoing (with motions and filings), so the final decree might not be in the documents yet.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"substantive obligations ordered by the court.\" If the case is still pending, there might not be a court order yet. But the user's task is to extract from the provided documents. Let me check the documents again.\n\nLooking at the \"Petition for Review\" document, it's a petition to review the EPA's rule. The petition doesn't include a decree; it's asking the court to vacate the rule. The \"Underlying Decision\" is the EPA's rule itself. The Docket shows the case is in progress, so no final decree has been issued. Therefore, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" might be \"Not Applicable\" because there's no court-ordered decree in the documents.\n\nWait, but the user's task says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If the documents don't contain any decree terms, then it should be marked as Not Applicable. The policy says to use \"Not Applicable\" only when there's explicit text supporting it, like the case being dismissed or no decree issued.\n\nIn the Docket, there's no mention of a decree. The case is still ongoing (the latest entry is 2023-08-11, and the case is set for submission dates). The Petition for Review is the initial filing, so the court hasn't issued an order yet. Therefore, the decree terms don't exist in the documents, so it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to check if the EPA rule is considered a court order. The EPA rule is a regulatory rule, not a court decree. The court hasn't issued an order yet, so there's no decree to extract. Therefore, the checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nThe user's recent actions have read the documents, but none of them contain a court decree. The EPA rule is the subject of the petition, but it's not a court order. So the correct action is to set \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" to Not Applicable via update_checklist.\n\nWait, the checklist summary shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". The user needs to mark it as Not Applicable. So the next step is to use update_checklist with the key set to \"Not Applicable\" and provide evidence.\n\nEvidence should be a verbatim text showing that there's no decree, like the case is ongoing and no order has been issued. Looking at the Docket, the latest entries are motions and submissions, so no final order. The \"Petition for Review\" is a request for review, not a decree. The EPA rule is the subject, not a court order.\n\nSo the evidence would be from the Docket or Petition stating the case is pending. For example, in the Docket, the case is still active, with motions filed, so no decree exists. The \"Underlying Decision\" is the EPA rule, not a court order.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call update_checklist with \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" set to \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the Docket entries showing the case is ongoing.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This petition arises from the following rule promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency: ...

The evidence they cited is:\n1. Underlying Decision mentions a rule is attached as Exhibit A\n2. Petition for Review cites the Clean Air Act but doesn't show court terms\n3.
