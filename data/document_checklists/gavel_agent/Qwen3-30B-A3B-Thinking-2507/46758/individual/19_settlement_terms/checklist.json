The court-ordered terms include: 'the court orders that petitioner be released from custody upon the posting of a $5,000 bond, and with the condition that he be placed on location monitoring with an ankle monitor' (Memorandum Opinion, p.12) and 'Defendants shall be enjoined from conducting detentive stops... unless the agent has reasonable suspicion' (Order (002), p.20). The definition requires terms not entered as court orders, and no settlement agreements with substantive terms were found in any document."
