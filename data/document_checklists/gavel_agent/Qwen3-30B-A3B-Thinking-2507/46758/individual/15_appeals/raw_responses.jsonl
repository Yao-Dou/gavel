The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why there are no documents. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to see what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the right function to use here. It will return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct first step is definitely `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3111, "completion_tokens": 257, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents might contain this information. The available documents are Docket, two Orders (001 and 002), and two Memorandum Opinions. Since the task is about appeals, the Docket might have the most relevant info because dockets often list appeals. The other documents are orders, which might not mention appeals unless they're appellate orders.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, so I need to start reading documents. The Docket is the largest at 36k tokens, but the system says not to read more than 10k tokens at a time. So I should read a portion of the Docket first. But maybe using a regex search would be smarter to find mentions of \"appeal\" or \"appellate\" without reading the whole thing.\n\nWait, the decision policy says to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. The key here is \"appeal\", so a regex like \"appeal\" or \"appellate\" could work. Let me check the tools. The `search_document_regex` function can search for patterns. The pattern should be something like r'appeal|appellate' to catch variations. Using this on all documents might help find where appeals are mentioned.\n\nBut the user has 5 documents. Searching all might be efficient. The parameters for `search_document_regex` allow doc_name='all' to search all documents. So I'll set pattern to \"appeal|appellate\" and maybe use IGNORECASE since case might vary. The top_k can be 5, context_tokens 200. That should give me the relevant sections without reading the whole document.\n\nWait, but the Docket is the most likely place for appeals, so maybe search only the Docket first. But the user might not know, so searching all is safer. The policy says to use regex when target is patternable, which it is here. So the next action should be `search_document_regex` with pattern \"appeal|appellate\" across all documents. That way, I can get the exact locations where appeals are mentioned, then read those specific sections.\n\nI should check the required parameters. The function needs a pattern, which I have. The default for doc_name is 'all', so I don't need to specify it. Flags could include IGNORECASE to catch different cases. So the arguments would be pattern: \"appeal|appellate\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k:5, context_tokens:200.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the next step is to call `search_document_regex` with those parameters to find the relevant parts in the documents. Then, once I get the matches, I can read the specific sections to extract the exact text for the checklist.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"appeal|appellate\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "appeal|appellate", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3300, "completion_tokens": 674, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all appeal-related checklist items from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\" with a specific format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already done a search_document_regex across all 5 documents and found 20 matches. The most promising matches are in the \"Docket\" and \"Order (001)\" and \"Order (002)\" documents. \n\nWait, in the Docket matches, Match 5 (tokens 22858-23058) says: \"NOTIFICATION from Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of case number assigned and briefing schedule. Appeal Docket No. 25-4312 assigned to Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 89 as to Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, Gregory K. Bovino, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Rodney S. Scott, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Eddy Wang.\"\n\nThat's perfect! It explicitly states the appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals with the list of defendants. The parties are \"Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, Gregory K. Bovino, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Rodney S. Scott, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Eddy Wang.\" So the extracted value should be \"Appeal: Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, Gregory K. Bovino, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Rodney S. Scott, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Eddy Wang appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nBut wait, the checklist requires the format to be 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So I need to make sure the parties are correctly listed as the appealing party. In this case, the defendants are the ones appealing, so \"Defendants ... appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nNow, checking if there are other matches. The Order (001) and (002) documents mention \"No. 25-4312\" and \"Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\" but the Docket match has the explicit appeal notification. The other matches in Docket (matches 1-4) are about transcripts, not appeals. The Memorandum Opinion mentions the Ninth Circuit but doesn't state an appeal was taken—it's discussing jurisdiction. \n\nSo the only clear evidence is in the Docket's Match 5. The document is \"Docket\" with tokens 22858-23058. The source document is \"Docket,\" location is \"tokens 22858-23058\" (or maybe \"Docket entry 98\" as per the match description). The evidence text is the exact snippet from the match.\n\nI need to use append_checklist to add this value. The key is \"Appeal,\" and the extracted value should be in the required format. Let me verify the format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So the value string should be \"Appeal: Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, Gregory K. Bovino, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Rodney S. Scott, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Eddy Wang appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nWait, the checklist says \"the extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\" So the entire string should be exactly that. The parties are the defendants listed, and the court is \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nI should make sure that \"Defendants\" is part of the parties string. The match says \"as to Defendants [list]\", so the parties are \"Defendants [list]\". So the value is \"Appeal: Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, ... Eddy Wang appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text is the snippet from the match. Source document is \"Docket\". Location can be \"Docket entry 98\" or \"tokens 22858-23058\" as per the match details.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have:\n- text: the exact snippet from the match\n- source_document: \"Docket\"\n- location: \"tokens 22858-23058\" or \"Docket entry 98\"\n\nLooking at the match description: \"Match 5 (tokens 22858-23058)\" so location is tokens 22858-23058.\n\nNow, since this is the first value found, I should use append_checklist to add it. The checklist key is \"Appeal\", and the extracted array will have this single entry.\n\nWait, the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", so adding this will fill the key. But the checklist item might have multiple values, but in this case, it's the only one found so far.\n\nI need to make sure not to use update_checklist here because it's the first entry, and append_checklist is for adding new entries. Since there are no existing entries, append is correct.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the patch for \"Appeal\" containing this extracted value with evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Appeal: Defendants Michael W.

The extracted value is: \"Appeal: Defendants Michael W. Banks, Pam Bondi, Gregory K. Bovino, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Rodney S. Scott, Jeffrey D.

Wait, but the checklist has only one item, \"Appeal\", so if it's already extracted, maybe it's done. However, the system says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so maybe there are more appeals in other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's another Order (002) that has a section about the appeal. Let me check the provided matches. In the Order (002) matches, Match 4 and 5 mention \"Appeal\" and \"Ninth Circuit\". For example, in Match 4 (tokens 886-1086), it says \"Defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending their appeal of the TRO.\" But the specific appeal details might be in the document.\n\nWait, the existing extracted value is from the Docket entry about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Order (002) document mentions \"Case: 25-4312\" and \"Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\" in the header. For instance, in Order (002) Match 1 and 2, the case number is \"No. 25-4312\" and it's filed with the \"Ninth Circuit\". Also, the Order (001) has \"No. 25-4312\" and \"Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\" in the header.\n\nWait, but the extracted value already includes the Ninth Circuit. The Docket entry (Match 5) says \"NOTIFICATION from Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of case number assigned and briefing schedule. Appeal Docket No. 25-4312 assigned to Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals...\". So the appeal is to the Ninth Circuit, and the parties are listed there.\n\nBut maybe there's another appeal mentioned elsewhere. Let's check the other documents. The Memorandum Opinion and Order has references to the Ninth Circuit, like \"U.S. v. McCandless, 841 F.3d 819 (9th Cir. 2016)\" and \"Ninth Circuit has 'not yet decided whether district courts have the inherent authority...'\". But that's a citation to a prior Ninth Circuit case, not the current appeal. The current case is about an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, which is already captured in the Docket entry.\n\nThe Order (001) and (002) both have \"No. 25-4312\" and \"Ninth Circuit\" in the header, so they are part of the same appeal case. The Docket entry already captured the appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The Order documents are the appellate court's orders in that case, so the appeal is already covered.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about \"any appeals taken\", and the existing entry is the Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The Order documents are the court's response to that appeal, but the appeal itself was already noted in the Docket. So perhaps there are no other distinct appeals to extract.\n\nBut the system says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". The current extracted value is one. Are there more? Let's check the other documents. The Memorandum Opinion mentions \"Bautista\" case, but that's a different case. The Order (002) mentions \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California\", which is the same case (25-4312), so it's the same appeal. So the same appeal is being discussed, but the parties and court are the same as the Docket entry.\n\nTherefore, the existing value is the only one. But wait, the Order (001) and (002) have the same case number, so it's the same appeal. The Docket entry already captured the appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The other documents don't mention any other appeals.\n\nWait, the Docket entry's Match 5 says \"NOTIFICATION from Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of case number assigned and briefing schedule. Appeal Docket No. 25-4312 assigned to Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 89 as to Defendants...\". So the appeal is to the Ninth Circuit, and the parties are the Defendants listed. The Order (001) and (002) are the appellate court's orders in that case, so they don't add new appeal information—they're part of the same appeal.\n\nTherefore, there's only one distinct appeal to extract. The checklist item \"Appeal\" has one value. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. But the user might have expected to check if there are more. However, based on the documents provided, there's only one appeal mentioned.\n\nWait, the Order (002) Match 4 mentions \"Defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending their appeal of the TRO.\" But the appeal is the same as the one in the Docket entry. The parties are the same (Defendants), and the court is the same (Ninth Circuit). So it's the same appeal, not a new one. Therefore, the value would be the same as the existing entry, so no new distinct value.\n\nHence, the checklist is already complete with one entry. The next step should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key \"Appeal\" is complete with one value. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another appeal. The Memorandum Opinion mentions \"Bautista\" case, which is a different case (case no. 5:25-cv-01873-SSS-BFM), but that's a district court case, not an appeal. The appeal in question is the one to the Ninth Circuit for the current case (25-4312). So no other appeals are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the checklist is fully extracted. The next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Appeal) are fully extracted with one distinct value.

The task is to find all distinct values related to appeals, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 was an append_checklist that added one value from the Docket document. The extracted value mentions Defendants like Michael W. Banks, Kristi Noem, etc., appealing to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The system says \"All checklist items (Appeal) are fully extracted with one distinct value.\" But I need to check if there are any other appeals in the remaining documents.\n\nThe available documents include:\n- Docket (partially visited, 1% coverage)\n- Memorandum Opinion (12% coverage)\n- Order (001) (45% coverage)\n- Order (002) (2% coverage)\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications (unvisited)\n\nWait, the Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications is unvisited (○ Unvisited). The previous steps didn't read this document. Maybe there's an appeal mentioned here. Let me check the document name: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction.\" This seems like a district court order, not an appellate one. But maybe it references an appeal.\n\nThe system's recent actions show that the Docket document had the only appeal mentioned. The other documents (Order (001), Order (002)) are from the Ninth Circuit, but they're orders from the appellate court, not the appeal itself. The Order (001) mentions \"Defendants filed two motions with this court requesting a stay pending appeal,\" which confirms that an appeal is ongoing, but the appeal details (like the parties and court) were already captured in the Docket entry. The Docket entry was the one that explicitly said \"Appeal Docket No. 25-4312 assigned to Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" with the parties listed.\n\nWait, the Order (001) and (002) are from the Ninth Circuit, so they're part of the appeal process, but the initial notice of appeal was in the Docket. The checklist item is about the appeal itself, so the Docket entry is the source for the appeal details. The other orders are about the appeal's status (like stays), not the appeal's initiation.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion document talks about jurisdiction and court references (like Ninth Circuit), but it's a district court opinion, not an appeal. It mentions \"the Ninth Circuit has not yet decided...\" which is about the appellate court, but it's not an appeal being taken; it's discussing existing appellate precedent.\n\nThe Order (001) and (002) are appellate court orders, so they're part of the appeal, but the specific appeal details (who appealed to which court) were already extracted from the Docket. The checklist item is about the appeal taken, so the Docket's notice of appeal is the primary source.\n\nThe unvisited document is \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications...\" which is a district court order. It might mention any appeals, but the name suggests it's about a TRO (temporary restraining order), not an appeal. The text from Order (002) mentions \"Defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending their appeal of the TRO,\" so the appeal is already noted in the Docket.\n\nSince the Docket entry already captured the appeal with all the parties and the court (9th Circuit), and the other documents either reference the same appeal or are about the appeal's proceedings but don't add new parties or courts, there's no additional distinct appeal value to extract.\n\nThe system's current status shows that the Appeal key has 1 value, which is complete. The user's step 4 tried to stop, but the system required a second stop attempt. Now, after the automatic checklist review, it's time to confirm if there's anything else.\n\nWait, the Order (001) and (002) are from the Ninth Circuit, but the appeal was already documented in the Docket. The checklist item is to extract the appeal information, which was already done. The other documents don't provide new appeal details.\n\nAlso, the Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here because the appeal was found.
