The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, all documents are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited). The available documents include Complaints (multiple amendments), Docket, Orders, and a Mediation Report. The Docket is likely the best place to find the filing date because dockets typically list the initial filing date.\n\nSince the Docket document is 24,237 tokens, which is over 10,000, I can't read the whole thing at once. But the user said to read a targeted window of up to 10,000 tokens. The Docket probably has the filing date near the top, so I'll start by reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Docket document. That should cover the initial entries where the filing date would be listed.\n\nI should use read_document for the Docket document, starting at token 0, ending at 10000. That way, I can check the beginning of the Docket for the filing date. The other documents like Complaints might have the date in the header, but the Docket is more reliable for the court's official filing date.\n\nNo need to use regex search first because the filing date is a specific date format, but since the Docket is the most likely place, reading the start of it makes sense. If the date isn't there, I can look elsewhere, but starting with the Docket is the logical first step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3347, "completion_tokens": 378, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the Filing_Date extracted from the legal documents. From the recent actions, they've already read the Docket document from tokens 0-10000. The Docket entry shows the first entry as:\n\n\"1 | 2022-05-31 | Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $ 402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael) (Entered: 05/31/2022)\"\n\nSo the filing date here is 2022-05-31. The requirement is to extract every distinct value, so this seems like the only one so far. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and the evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe Docket document is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but the text they provided includes the date. Since they read up to 10000 tokens and the relevant info is in the first few lines, it's covered. Now, I need to append this to the checklist. The value is \"2022-05-31\", and the evidence should have the text snippet, source document \"Docket\", and location like \"Docket entry 1\" or \"tokens 0-10000\".\n\nWait, the problem says to create separate entries for each unique value. Since there's only one value here, it's straightforward. The next step is to use append_checklist with the extracted value. The evidence needs to be properly formatted with text, source_document, and location.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: \"text\" must be verbatim snippet. The snippet here is \"2022-05-31 | Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $ 402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael) (Entered: 05/31/2022)\" but actually, the date is part of the entry. Wait, the date mentioned is 2022-05-31, which is the filing date. The entry shows the date as part of the docket entry.\n\nWait, the first line in the Docket read is \"1 | 2022-05-31 | Complaint...\", so the date 2022-05-31 is the filing date. The evidence text should be the exact part where this date is mentioned. So the verbatim text would be \"2022-05-31 | Complaint...\", but the key value is \"2022-05-31\".\n\nSo the evidence's text should be the snippet containing that date, source is Docket, location is the Docket entry 1 or tokens 0-10000. Since the document was read from 0-10000, location can be \"Docket (tokens 0-10000)\".\n\nNow, check if there are other entries in the Docket that might have different filing dates. The next entries are on 2022-06-01, etc., but those are subsequent events, not the original filing. The first entry is the complaint filing, so the filing date is 2022-05-31.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"2022-05-31\", with evidence as the text from the first line of the Docket.\n\nSince this is the first value, and the checklist is empty, we need to append this. The action should be append_checklist with the key Filing_Date, and the extracted list containing one entry with the value and evidence.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"Every extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the evidence must have the text, source, and location.\n\nSo the evidence array should have one entry with text (the verbatim snippet), source_document \"Docket\", location \"Docket entry 1\" or \"tokens 0-10000\".\n\nIn the Docket read, the first line is tokens 0-10000, so location can be \"Docket (tokens 0-10000)\".\n\nNow, the function to use is append_checklist because we're adding a new entry. The key is Filing_Date, extracted is a list with one entry.\n\nCheck the parameters: append_checklist requires a patch array with key and extracted. Each extracted entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo the patch should be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"2022-05-31\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"1 | 2022-05-31 | Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $ 402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael) (Entered: 05/31/2022)\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket (tokens 0-10000)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the evidence is an array. The problem says \"evidence\" is an array of evidence objects. So for each value, there's an array of evidence entries. Since we have one evidence snippet, it's an array with one element.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the next action is to append this value to Filing_Date using append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"2022-05-31\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"1 | 2022-05-31 | Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants.

The user wants me to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Step 2 was read_document on Docket from tokens 0-10000, and Step 3 was append_checklist for Filing_Date with the value 2022-05-31 from the Docket entry.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value, and the Docket document is partially visited (viewed 0-10000, 41% coverage). The other documents are unvisited. But the Filing_Date is the first filing date, which should be in the initial complaint or the docket entry. The Docket entry 1 shows \"2022-05-31\" as the filing date for the Complaint. So that's probably the correct date.\n\nWait, but the user said to extract EVERY distinct value. Is there a chance there are other filing dates? Like, maybe the amended complaints have their own filing dates, but the checklist specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing is the original complaint, which is 2022-05-31. The amended complaints would have later dates, but they're not the initial filing date. So the correct value is just 2022-05-31.\n\nThe Docket document has been partially read (only up to token 10000), but the entry for the complaint is in the first part (entry 1). The user already extracted that. The other documents like Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc., might have their own filing dates, but those are not the initial filing. The checklist is specifically for the first filing, so those other dates don't count.\n\nSo the only value needed is 2022-05-31. The current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value, which matches the extracted one. The other documents (Complaint, etc.) are unvisited, but since they're amended complaints, their filing dates aren't relevant here. The Docket document already has the correct date.\n\nThe next step would be to check if there's any other possible value in the Docket document. But the Docket entry 1 is the first one, and the date there is the filing date. The other entries in the Docket are subsequent events (like notices, motions, etc.), so their dates (like 2022-06-01, 2022-06-03, etc.) are not the initial filing date.\n\nTherefore, the Filing_Date is correctly extracted as 2022-05-31. There are no other values to extract. The checklist is complete. So the next action should be to stop, since all required values are extracted.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the key Filing_Date is filled with one value. The other keys (there's only one) are done. So the next action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Docket document's first entry (entry 1) says \"2022-05-31\" as the filing date. The document is called \"Docket\", which typically lists all entries with their dates. The \"Entered\" date is 05/31/2022, which matches the filing date. So that's correct.\n\nNo other documents need to be checked because the initial filing date is in the Docket. The Complaint document might have the same date, but it's redundant. The checklist says to extract every distinct value, but since it's the same date, it's not distinct.
