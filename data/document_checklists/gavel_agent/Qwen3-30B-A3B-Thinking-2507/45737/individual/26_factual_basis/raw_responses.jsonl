According to the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The tools available include list_documents, which is supposed to return all documents with their metadata. Since there are no documents discovered yet, the next logical step is to use list_documents to find out what documents are available to process.\n\nThe user's task is to extract checklist items, but without any documents, there's nothing to extract from. So the only action possible here is to list the documents. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require knowing which documents exist, which we don't yet.

The user needs to extract the Factual_Basis_of_Case from the legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and there are 9 unvisited documents. The first action was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Now, the next step is to read a document to find the factual basis.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Complaints (First, Second, Third Amended) are likely to contain the core facts of the case. The Docket might have procedural details, but the factual basis is probably in the Complaints. Since the Third Amended Complaint is the longest (40k tokens), maybe it's the most detailed. But the user should start with the earliest document to get the initial facts. Wait, the order is Complaint, then First Amended, etc. The original Complaint might have the initial facts, but amended complaints could have updated facts. However, the task is to extract all distinct values, so maybe all amendments have relevant info.\n\nBut the system says not to reread documents, so starting with the first unvisited one. The Complaint is listed first. It's 19k tokens, which is over 10k, so need to read in chunks. But the user should read the first 10k tokens. Wait, the read_document function allows up to 10k tokens. So for the Complaint, start at token 0 to 10000.\n\nWait, the documents are all marked as ○ Unvisited, so no tokens viewed yet. So the first read should be the Complaint from 0 to 10000. The user needs to choose read_document for Complaint, start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search for a pattern like \"Factual Basis\" or \"facts\" using regex, but the checklist definition says it's about events, evidence, background. The regex might not be precise. The safer bet is to read the Complaint first, as it's the foundational document. So the next action is read_document on Complaint, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3440, "completion_tokens": 481, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document. The task is to find all distinct values related to the factual basis of the case, each with evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's in the Complaint document they've read. The text provided covers pages 1-18 of the Complaint. The key sections here would be the \"RELEVANT FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS\" starting at paragraph 16. Let me scan through those.\n\nParagraph 16 mentions the George Floyd murder leading to peaceful demonstrations. Paragraph 17 says the FLPD decided to disperse peaceful demonstrators with chemical and less-lethal force. Then paragraphs 18-28 detail the use of tear gas (riot control agents) and the effects. Paragraphs 29-46 talk about kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs), their dangers, and how they were misused. Paragraphs 47-51 discuss the dispersal order and lack of warning. Paragraphs 52-68 cover Florida law on unlawful assemblies and the absence of a dispersal order. Then paragraphs 69-98 give the timeline, including the peaceful gathering, the false claims of being surrounded, the use of force without warning, and specific incidents like the attack on the woman by Officer Pohorence.\n\nThe factual basis should include the key facts: the peaceful demonstration, the use of tear gas and KIPs without lawful justification, the lack of dispersal order, the specific incident where Ms. Ratlieff was shot, and the background on the organizers and participants.\n\nLooking at the text, the relevant parts are in paragraphs 16-17, 18-28 (tear gas details), 29-46 (KIPs), 47-51 (dispersal order), 52-68 (Florida law), and 69-98 (timeline). Each of these contributes to the factual basis.\n\nFor evidence, I need to extract verbatim snippets. For example, the incident where Ms. Ratlieff was shot: \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration...\" That's a key fact. Also, the lack of dispersal order: \"At no point was their assembly declared unlawful. Nor was any dispersal order given.\"\n\nAnother fact is the use of tear gas and KIPs without proper warnings: \"No advance warning or announcement was made before FLPD deployed chemical and less-than-lethal munitions.\" And the specific incident with the woman being attacked: \"video footage shows a responding member of the FLPD (Stephen Pohorence) physically attacking a peaceful demonstrator.\"\n\nEach of these needs to be a separate entry with evidence. The user wants every distinct value, so each unique fact with its context.\n\nSince the current action is to extract from the read document, and they've read up to 10,000 tokens (which covers up to page 18), I should check if there's enough info here to extract the factual basis. The text does contain multiple factual points, so I can start appending these.\n\nThe checklist item \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" is empty, so I need to use append_checklist to add the extracted entries. Each entry should have the value (the fact), and evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nLooking at the evidence requirements, each entry must have a verbatim snippet. So for the main fact of the shooting: the snippet is \"unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration...\" from page 1.\n\nAnother fact: the use of tear gas without dispersal order: \"No advance warning or announcement was made before FLPD deployed chemical and less-than-lethal munitions.\" from page 16.\n\nAlso, the specific incident with the woman: \"video footage shows a responding member of the FLPD (Stephen Pohorence) physically attacking a peaceful demonstrator.\" from page 15.\n\nI need to make sure each of these is a separate entry. The user mentioned \"every distinct value,\" so each of these facts should be a separate entry.\n\nNow, check if the current document has more. The read tokens go up to page 18, which includes the part about the tear gas filling the garage. So there's more, but the key points are covered.\n\nSince they've read 10,000 tokens (51% of the document), but the relevant sections are in the beginning, I can extract from what's read. The next step is to append these entries to the checklist.\n\nThe action should be append_checklist with the extracted values. Each entry in the extracted list needs evidence. So for each fact, create an entry with the value (the fact) and evidence including the text snippet, document name, and location (page number).\n\nWait, the location should be \"page\" as per the example. The document is the Complaint, and the location is the page number. For example, page 1 for the first fact.\n\nSo, the first entry: value is \"unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration\", evidence text is the exact quote from page 1, source document Complaint, location \"Page 1\".\n\nSecond entry: \"No advance warning or announcement was made before FLPD deployed chemical and less-than-lethal munitions\", from page 16.\n\nThird entry: \"video footage shows a responding member of the FLPD (Stephen Pohorence) physically attacking a peaceful demonstrator\", from page 15.\n\nWait, the text says \"body camera footage\" in paragraph 78, but the evidence should be the verbatim text. The actual quote in the document is: \"video footage shows a responding member of the FLPD (Stephen Pohorence) physically attacking a peaceful demonstrator.\"\n\nSo the value would be that fact, and the evidence text is the quote.\n\nI need to make sure each value is distinct. The factual basis includes these points, so each is a separate value.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append these three entries to the Factual_Basis_of_Case key.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This federal civil rights and state law tort action arises from the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the “George Floyd Demonstrations” in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"FLPD deployed tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles without lawful justification or dispersal order\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"At no point was their assembly declared unlawful.

The document catalog shows that Complaint is partially visited (0-10000 tokens out of 19732), so there's more to read. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist item might have more values there.\n\nWait, the task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The current extraction has three values from the Complaint. But maybe there are more in the unvisited part of the Complaint or in other documents. However, the Decision Policy says not to reread fully visited documents (but this one is partially visited). The next step should be to read more of the Complaint since it's partially visited and might contain more factual basis details.\n\nThe user's recent action was appending the checklist after reading the first 10k tokens. Now, the next logical step is to continue reading the Complaint from token 10000 onwards to see if there's more relevant info. The document is 19,732 tokens, so the next chunk would be 10000-20000, but since 19732 is less than 20k, it would be up to 19732.\n\nBut wait, the system says not to read token ranges already viewed. The Complaint's viewed tokens are 0-10000, so next should be 10000-19732. However, the maximum per read_document is 10,000 tokens. So 10000-19732 is 9732 tokens, which is under 10k. So that's acceptable.\n\nOther documents like the Docket or Orders might have more info, but the current checklist item is already getting values from the Complaint. Since the Complaint is partially visited and the item is not yet complete (though the user might think it's done), the next step is to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint to check for more factual basis entries.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract all distinct values. The existing three values are from the first part. Maybe the later part of the Complaint has more details. For example, paragraphs 69-98 mention the timeline, which might add more factual basis points.
