The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and there are 9 unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain the class action status. The main complaint documents (First, Second, Third Amended Complaints) are probably where the plaintiff's designation would be stated. The Docket might have some info, but the Complaints are more likely to have the initial claim.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I need to pick one to read. The Third Amended Complaint is the largest at 40,833 tokens, but maybe starting with the First Amended Complaint would be better since it's the first major version. Wait, but the user said to read a targeted window up to 10,000 tokens. So maybe read the first 10k tokens of the First Amended Complaint to find the relevant section.\n\nWait, the instructions say not to reread, but all are unvisited, so it's okay. The key is to get the class action status. The checklist requires the value to be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nI should use read_document on the First Amended Complaint, starting at token 0, end at 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. The other documents might have it too, but starting with the Complaint makes sense.\n\nWait, the Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is the primary document where the plaintiff's claim is stated. So reading the Complaint first is logical. Let's go with read_document for First Amended Complaint, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"First Amended Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3397, "completion_tokens": 423, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to format it as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first one read was the First Amended Complaint (tokens 0-10000). The text starts with the case details. Let me scan through the document to find any mention of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nIn the document, the plaintiff is Latoya Ratlieff, and the defendants include the City of Fort Lauderdale and several individuals. The complaint mentions \"Plaintiff, vs. City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a Municipal Government; Eliezer Ramos, individually; Paul Cristafaro, individually; etc.\" So the plaintiff is acting individually, not as a class. The description says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description here would be \"Latoya Ratlieff, an unarmed and defenseless Black woman\" based on the complaint's opening.\n\nWait, the complaint says \"Latoya Ratlieff, Plaintiff\" and lists the defendants with \"individually\" for some. The key point is that the plaintiff is a single individual, not a class. So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Latoya Ratlieff, an unarmed and defenseless Black woman\".\n\nI need to check if there's any mention of a class action. Scanning through the text, there's no indication of a class action. The case is brought by one plaintiff. The complaint doesn't reference a class, so it's individual. The evidence is in the caption and the parties section.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Latoya Ratlieff, an unarmed and defenseless Black woman\". The evidence would be the first page where the plaintiff is named and the defendants listed as individuals.\n\nThe document is \"First Amended Complaint\", tokens 0-10000. The location is Page 1 (since it's the start of the document). The exact text: \"LATOYA RATLIEFF, Plaintiff, vs. CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, a Municipal Government; ELIEZER RAMOS, individually; PAUL CRISTAFARO, individually; etc.\"\n\nWait, the exact line says \"LATOYA RATLIEFF, Plaintiff, vs. CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, a Municipal Government; ELIEZER RAMOS, individually; PAUL CRISTAFARO, individually; STEVE GREENLAW, individually; AVERY FIGUERAS, individually; DOUGLAS MACDOUGHALL, individually; ROBERT DIETRICH, individually; JOHN DOE 1, individually; JOHN DOE 2, individually; and JOHN DOE 3, individually, Defendants.\"\n\nSo the plaintiff is one person, and the defendants include individuals. Therefore, it's individual plaintiffs. The description should be \"Latoya Ratlieff\", but the requirement says to include a brief description. The complaint describes her as \"an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff\" in the first paragraph. So the description would be \"an unarmed and defenseless Black woman\" as per the case details.\n\nWait, the first paragraph says: \"This federal civil rights and state law tort action arises from the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff...\" So the description is \"unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nThus, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nWait, the example says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description should be the brief description from the document. So \"unarmed and defenseless\" from the first paragraph.\n\nBut let me check the exact wording. The case says \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff\". So the description is \"unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nEvidence: The text snippet from the document: \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the 'George Floyd Demonstrations' in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\"\n\nSo the evidence text is that sentence. Source document is \"First Amended Complaint\", location is page 1 (since it's the first paragraph), tokens 0-10000.\n\nNow, since this is the first value found, I need to append it to the checklist using append_checklist. The key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value is as above.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so the key name is correct. The value should be formatted as specified. The example given in the requirements says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nWait, the description is \"unarmed and defenseless\", so the full value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nBut the example says \"described as [description]\", so the [description] part is \"unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nSo the value string is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\".\n\nNow, the evidence must include the text snippet, source document, and location. The text snippet is the part from the document, source is \"First Amended Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\" (or tokens 0-10000, but the document's page numbers are given as \"Page 1 of 43\", so location can be \"Page 1\").\n\nWait, the document shows \"Page 1 of 43\" at the top. So location is \"Page 1\".\n\nSo the evidence object would have:\n- text: \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the 'George Floyd Demonstrations' in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\"\n- source_document: \"First Amended Complaint\"\n- location: \"Page 1\"\n\nNow, since this is the first entry for this key, and the key was empty, we need to append it. The action should be append_checklist with the patch for the key.\n\nThe tool parameters for append_checklist require a patch array with key and extracted array. Each extracted entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo the patch would be:\n{\n  \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the 'George Floyd Demonstrations' in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of evidence objects. Each entry in extracted has evidence as an array. So for this value, there's one evidence entry.\n\nYes, so the structure is correct.\n\nNow, the next action after reading the document is to append the checklist item. Since the user has read the document and found the value, the next step is to append it.\n\nSo the correct function call is append_checklist with the patch as above.\n\nI should check if there are other possible values in the document, but the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the document clearly states it's an individual plaintiff. There's no mention of a class, so this is the only value.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the \\\"George Floyd Demonstrations\\\" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless", "evidence": [{"text": "the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff on May 31, 2020, during her peaceful participation in a public demonstration at the \"George Floyd Demonstrations\" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.", "source_document": "First Amended Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14012, "completion_tokens": 1885, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the class action status from legal documents, specifically the checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". \n\nFirst, I need to recall the current state. From the recent actions, Step 3 already appended one value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\" from the First Amended Complaint. The document catalog shows that the First Amended Complaint has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), but there are other documents like the Second and Third Amended Complaints that are unvisited.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract every distinct value. The current extracted value uses \"Individual\" with a description. But I should check if there's more in other documents. The key is whether the case is a class action or individual plaintiffs. The current value says \"Individual\", but I need to confirm if that's accurate and if there are other values.\n\nLooking at the provided text from the First Amended Complaint, the plaintiff is Latoya Ratlieff, and she's the only named plaintiff. The complaint mentions \"Plaintiff\" singular, and the defendants include John Does, but no mention of a class. The description says \"unarmed and defenseless\" which is part of the individual plaintiff description. So the current extraction seems correct.\n\nBut I should check other documents. The Second and Third Amended Complaints might have more info. For example, sometimes cases start as individual and later amend to class action, or vice versa. The available documents include Second and Third Amended Complaints, which are unvisited. The user's goal is to extract all distinct values, so I need to check those.\n\nThe current status shows 1 key with 1 value, and no empty or Not Applicable keys. But to be thorough, I should read the Second Amended Complaint to see if it changes the status. The First Amended Complaint says \"Plaintiff\" (singular), but maybe the amended complaints clarify if it's a class action.\n\nWait, the checklist item definition says: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The current value uses \"Individual\" with a description. So if the Second or Third Complaints also say individual, it's the same value, so no new entry. But if they say class action, that would be a new distinct value.\n\nThe user's recent action was appending the value from the First Amended Complaint. Now, the next step is to check other documents. Since the First Amended Complaint is partially visited (only up to 10k tokens), but the rest of the document might not have more info on the class status. The next logical step is to read the Second Amended Complaint, which is unvisited. But the user might need to confirm if there's a class action.\n\nWait, the documents available include \"Second Amended Complaint\" and \"Third Amended Complaint\". The current extraction is from the First. So to be safe, I should read the Second Amended Complaint to check if it's amended to a class action. If it's still individual, then no new value. But if it's a class action, that's a new value.\n\nThe current extracted value is \"Individual\", so if the Second Amended Complaint says \"Class Action\", that's a new distinct value. Otherwise, no.\n\nGiven that the First Amended Complaint is about one plaintiff (Latoya Ratlieff), it's likely individual. But I need to verify. The safest action is to read the Second Amended Complaint to check for any mention of class action.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on \"Second Amended Complaint\" from tokens 0-10000 (since it's unvisited, start at 0). That's within the 10k token limit. The user shouldn't read the entire document at once, so 10k tokens is standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use `search_document_regex` to look for \"class action\" or \"class\" in the documents. But the user's policy says to use `read_document` for targeted reading if it's likely to contain the value. Since the Second Amended Complaint is a complaint, it's probable it would state the nature of the action.\n\nBut the user's system says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document (default) or search_document_regex\". Here, the Second Amended Complaint is the next logical document to check, so `read_document` is appropriate.\n\nCheck the document catalog: \"Second Amended Complaint\" is unvisited, so no previous reads. So call `read_document` with doc_name \"Second Amended Complaint\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the token count for Second Amended Complaint is 40,493, so reading 0-10000 is safe.\n\nSo the correct action is `read_document` on \"Second Amended Complaint\" for tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Second Amended Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Second Amended Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14157, "completion_tokens": 1094, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've already read the First Amended Complaint and appended one entry. The value was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\" from page 1. Then they read the Second Amended Complaint, but the text provided stops at page 18. The user needs to check if there's more info in the Second Amended Complaint or other documents.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value extracted. The task is to check if there are more values. The Second Amended Complaint might have additional info. The document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens, 25% coverage). So maybe there's more in the unvisited parts. But the user's last action was reading tokens 0-10000 of the Second Amended Complaint. The text given ends at page 18, which might be within the 10k tokens. Wait, the document has 40,493 tokens, so 10k tokens might cover up to around page 18 or so. But the user needs to check if the class action status is mentioned again.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. In the First Amended Complaint, it's individual plaintiffs. The Second Amended Complaint might still be individual, but maybe they added a class action. However, looking at the provided text of the Second Amended Complaint, the parties section lists \"Latoya Ratlieff\" as plaintiff, and defendants are individuals. There's no mention of a class action. The case is still about her as an individual. So maybe the status is still individual.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. Since the Second Amended Complaint was partially read, maybe there's a section that clarifies. However, the text provided ends at paragraph 93, which seems to be part of the timeline. The key part would be in the caption or the parties section. The Second Amended Complaint's caption says \"LATOYA RATLIEFF, Plaintiff,\" followed by defendants. So it's still individual. So the value would be the same as before.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure there's no other mention. The checklist says to extract every distinct value. If it's the same, then no new value. But maybe they want to confirm that it's not a class action. Wait, the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\" So the description might be different, but in both complaints, it's just Latoya Ratlieff. So the value would be the same. So appending again would be redundant. But the user might need to check if there's a class action mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWait, the user's previous action was to append the value from the First Amended Complaint. Now, after reading the Second Amended Complaint, they need to check if there's a new value. But the Second Amended Complaint still refers to Latoya Ratlieff as the plaintiff, not a class. So no new value. However, maybe the description is different. In the First Amended Complaint, the description was \"unarmed and defenseless.\" In the Second, maybe it's the same or similar.\n\nLooking at the Second Amended Complaint text: the first page mentions \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff\" and the facts state she was \"tear gassed and shot in the head by a KIP.\" So the description might be similar. But the checklist requires each unique value. If it's the same description, then it's not a new value. So no new entry needed.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to check all documents. The available documents include Third Amended Complaint, Docket, etc. But the current status shows only 1 value. The next step is to check if there's more in the Second Amended Complaint. However, since the document was partially read, maybe they should read more tokens. But the provided text for the Second Amended Complaint in the recent action ends at page 18 (tokens 0-10000). The document is 40k tokens, so 25% covered. But the key info about the plaintiff type is likely in the caption or parties section, which is early on. So the initial part (which was read) already shows it's individual. So the Second Amended Complaint doesn't add new info.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to check if other documents might have the class action status. But the other documents are Docket, Orders, etc. The Docket might list the case as class action, but the complaints don't. Wait, the user's task is to extract from the legal documents, which include complaints. The Docket might have the case type. For example, the Docket entry might state \"Class Action\" or \"Individual.\"\n\nSo the next step is to read the Docket document, which is unvisited (○ Unvisited). The Docket is 24,237 tokens, so reading the whole thing isn't necessary. But the case type is often in the Docket entry. The Docket might have a line like \"Class Action\" or \"Individual.\"\n\nBut the user's current action is to choose one action. Since the Second Amended Complaint doesn't add new info, and the Docket is unvisited, the next logical step is to read the Docket document to check for class action status. However, the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is typically in the complaint. But if the Docket lists it as a class action, that's important.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so the Docket might have the case type. For example, the Docket might say \"Case No. 0:22-cv-61029-RAR - Class Action\" or something. But the First Amended Complaint says \"Plaintiff\" (singular), so it's individual. But maybe the Docket entry clarifies.\n\nAlternatively, the user should check the Docket document. So the next action should be read_document on the Docket, tokens 0-10000. Since it's unvisited, start from 0.\n\nWait, the available documents list the Docket as \"Docket [Docket] - 24,237 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". So it's unvisited. The user should read it to see if it mentions class action.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document on the Docket document, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24778, "completion_tokens": 1447, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the format should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 3 already appended a value from the First Amended Complaint. The extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\" with evidence from page 1. Then, Step 4 read the Second Amended Complaint, and Step 5 read the Docket.\n\nNow, I need to check if the Second Amended Complaint or Docket has any additional information about the class action status. The user's goal is to extract EVERY distinct value, so I should make sure not to miss any.\n\nFirst, the First Amended Complaint was read up to page 18 (tokens 0-10000), and the value extracted was about the plaintiff being unarmed and defenseless. But the checklist item isn't about the plaintiff's description; it's about whether it's a class action or individual. Wait, the requirement says: \"a designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs\". So the key is to determine if this is a class action (multiple plaintiffs) or individual (single plaintiff).\n\nIn the First Amended Complaint, the plaintiff is Latoya Ratlieff, and the defendants include multiple individuals (City of Fort Lauderdale, Eliezer Ramos, etc.). But the complaint is filed by one plaintiff, so it's individual, not a class action. The extracted value from Step 3 was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\", which seems correct.\n\nNow, checking the Second Amended Complaint. The document starts with \"Latoya Ratlieff, Plaintiff\" and lists multiple defendants, but the plaintiff is still just one person. So it's still individual. The complaint doesn't mention a class action. The title says \"SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT\" but doesn't indicate a class action. The parties section lists only Latoya Ratlieff as the plaintiff. So it's still individual.\n\nThe Docket shows the case was filed by LaToya Ratlieff, and the complaints (First, Second, etc.) are all by her as the sole plaintiff. The Docket entries don't mention a class action. For example, the initial complaint (DE 1) is \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee... filed by LaToya Ratlieff.\"\n\nSo the only value to extract is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description from the First Amended Complaint was \"unarmed and defenseless\", but maybe there's another description in the Second Amended Complaint. Let me check the Second Amended Complaint text provided.\n\nIn the Second Amended Complaint, the first paragraph says: \"This federal civil rights and state law tort action arises from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department’s (\"FLPD\") violent dispersal of peaceful demonstrators at the May 31, 2020 George Floyd demonstration. To effectuate that dispersal, FLPD deployed, without warning or a dispersal order, tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles (“KIPs”). Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff was tear gassed and shot in the head by a KIP.\"\n\nHere, \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff\" is singular, so it's individual. The description might be similar, but the key is to get the description from the document. The First Amended Complaint had \"unarmed and defenseless\", and the Second might have a different one, but I don't see it. The Second Amended Complaint's description is about being tear-gassed and shot, but the checklist requires the description of the plaintiffs (i.e., the plaintiff's characteristics). The previous extraction used \"unarmed and defenseless\" from the First Amended Complaint. Since the Second Amended Complaint is a continuation, the plaintiff is still the same, so maybe no new description. But I need to check if the Second Amended Complaint has a different description.\n\nLooking at the Second Amended Complaint text, it's similar to the First. The relevant part would be where it describes the plaintiff. In the First Amended Complaint, it's \"the unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff\". In the Second Amended Complaint, it says \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff was tear gassed and shot in the head by a KIP.\" So the description here is \"tear gassed and shot in the head\", but the checklist requires the description to be part of the \"Individual, described as [description]\". The previous extraction used \"unarmed and defenseless\", but maybe the Second Amended Complaint has a different description. However, the checklist says to extract \"every distinct value\", so if the description is the same, it's not a new value. But the user might expect to confirm if it's still individual.\n\nWait, the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so the value should be either \"Class Action\" or \"Individual, described as...\". The First Amended Complaint's value was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\". The Second Amended Complaint doesn't change the plaintiff from individual to class, so it's still individual. But the description might be different. Let me check if the Second Amended Complaint has a different description.\n\nIn the Second Amended Complaint, the paragraph about the plaintiff says: \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff was tear gassed and shot in the head by a KIP.\" So the description here is \"tear gassed and shot in the head\", but the previous one was \"unarmed and defenseless\". Are these considered distinct descriptions? The checklist says \"every distinct value\", so if the description is different, it's a new value. But the \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" part is the same; the description is the part in brackets. So \"unarmed and defenseless\" vs. \"tear gassed and shot in the head\" would be two different descriptions, hence two different values.\n\nWait, but the requirement says \"a designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable)\". So the description is a brief description of the individual plaintiffs. In this case, there's only one plaintiff, so the description should be a brief description of her. The First Amended Complaint describes her as \"unarmed and defenseless\", the Second as \"tear gassed and shot in the head\". But the latter is more about the incident, not her inherent description. The checklist probably wants the description of the plaintiff as a person, not the incident.\n\nLooking back at Step 3's extraction: \"Value 1: 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless'\". The evidence was from the First Amended Complaint: \"unlawful and unjustified police shooting of an unarmed and defenseless Latoya Ratlieff\".\n\nIn the Second Amended Complaint, the relevant part is \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff was tear gassed and shot in the head by a KIP.\" This describes what happened to her, not her inherent state. So the description \"unarmed and defenseless\" is the one from the First Amended Complaint, and the Second doesn't add a new description. Therefore, the value is the same, so no new entry needed.\n\nNow, checking the Docket: all filings are by LaToya Ratlieff as the plaintiff, no mention of a class action. So no new values here.\n\nThe current status shows that \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" has 1 value, and there are no empty keys or Not Applicable. The user has already extracted the correct value. The next step should be to verify if there are any other documents that might have more information. The available documents include \"Third Amended Complaint\" (unvisited), but since the First and Second Amended Complaints are already read and they don't indicate a class action, and the Docket also doesn't, it's unlikely that the Third Amended Complaint would change that. However, to be thorough, maybe check the Third Amended Complaint.\n\nBut according to the decision policy: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\". The Third Amended Complaint is unvisited, so we could read it. But the checklist item is about whether it's a class action. The First and Second Amended Complaints both list a single plaintiff, so it's individual. Unless the Third Amended Complaint changes that, but the user hasn't provided it. The snapshot says the Third Amended Complaint is unvisited, but the current action is to choose one of the tools.\n\nWait, the current status shows that all keys (only one) are filled. The \"Keys with Values\" is 1/1, \"Empty Keys\" 0/1. So according to the stop criteria, if all keys are filled, we should stop.\n\nBut let me confirm. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". The extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\". The requirement is to extract every distinct value. Since the case is individual (not a class action), and the description is \"unarmed and defenseless\" (from the First Amended Complaint), and there's no indication it's a class action in any document, this is the only value.\n\nThe Second Amended Complaint doesn't provide a different description that's relevant, and the Docket doesn't either. The other documents (Third Amended Complaint, etc.) are unvisited, but since the First and Second already confirm it's individual, there's no need to read them. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are complete. The key is complete with one value.\n\nThe user's recent actions show that Step 3 appended the value, and Steps 4 and 5 read the other documents but didn't find anything new. So the next step should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.

The user is trying to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they need to find all distinct values.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the First Amended Complaint: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as unarmed and defenseless\". The system says all checklist items are fully extracted, but I need to check if there's anything missing.\n\nThe available documents include Second Amended Complaint, Docket, and others. The Second Amended Complaint was read up to token 10,000, but maybe there's more info there. The Docket shows the case started as a complaint, but the Docket entries mention \"Complaint\" and \"Amended Complaints\", but no mention of class action.\n\nWait, the checklist requires checking if it's a class action or individual. The extracted value says \"Individual\", but the documents might have more details. The First Amended Complaint's evidence mentions \"Plaintiff Latoya Ratlieff\" as the sole plaintiff, and the complaint refers to her as the plaintiff. The Second Amended Complaint also lists her as the plaintiff without mentioning a class. The Docket shows the case number and filings, but all filings are by LaToya Ratlieff as the plaintiff.\n\nThe user's prior step 6 called stop, but the system automatically ran get_checklist and says 1/1 filled. However, the checklist definition says to extract EVERY distinct value. Since all documents seem to indicate individual plaintiffs (only one plaintiff named), there's no class action mentioned. So the extracted value is correct.\n\nBut wait, the system says \"All checklist items are fully extracted\" and the checklist status shows 1 value. The user needs to confirm if there's any other possible value. Let me check the Second Amended Complaint again. In the text provided (up to page 18), the complaint is filed by LaToya Ratlieff individually. The parties section lists her as the plaintiff, and all defendants are individuals. No class action certification or mention of a class.\n\nThe Docket entries don't mention class action either. All filings are from LaToya Ratlieff as the plaintiff. The \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" should be \"Individual\" with the description. The extracted value matches the documents.\n\nSince there's no indication of a class action anywhere in the documents, and only one value was extracted, the system is correct. The user should stop because all applicable values are extracted. The checklist key has one value, and it's complete. No need to check other documents because they're either unvisited or not relevant (like the Final Judgment, which is a short document but likely confirms the individual status).\n\nThe stop criteria are met: all keys are filled (only one key, and it's filled). There are no empty keys or Not Applicable needed. So the correct action is to stop again.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted.
