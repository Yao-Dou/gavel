The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value found.\n\nFirst, I should check the available documents. There are 9 documents listed, all unvisited. The task is to find court-ordered decrees, not just agreements. So I need to look for documents that mention decrees, injunctions, or judgments.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" and \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss\" might have decree durations. The \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" is a longer document, which could also contain such info. The Complaints might not have it since they're initial filings, but maybe the amended ones do. The Mediation Report is probably not relevant.\n\nSince the user wants to start extracting, the next step is to read a document that's most likely to contain the decree duration. The \"Final Judgment\" document is short (339 tokens) and named specifically with \"Judgment,\" so that's a good candidate. It's only 339 tokens, so reading the whole thing would be efficient without exceeding the 10k token limit.\n\nI should use read_document on \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" with start_token 0 and end_token 339. That way, I can check if it contains the duration info. If not, then move to the next likely document. But since it's the most relevant, starting here makes sense.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the document name suggests it's the right place. Using search_document_regex might be overkill here. So the next action should be read_document on that specific file.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 339}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 339}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3406, "completion_tokens": 405, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" from the documents. The user provided the current status, which shows that the key is empty, and the only document read so far is \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" (tokens 0-339), which didn't contain any decree duration info.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available documents. The \"Final Judgment\" was fully visited, so no need to read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Amended Complaints, Docket, Orders, Mediation Report. Since the checklist item is about decree duration, which is likely in court orders or judgments, the relevant documents would probably be the Orders and Judgments. The \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" (70,934 tokens) and \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss\" (23,202 tokens) are good candidates. The \"Final Judgment\" was already checked, but maybe the summary judgment order mentions a decree duration.\n\nWait, the \"Final Judgment\" document mentioned \"Final Judgment\" but didn't have any duration. The \"Order on Cross Motions...\" might have details about the decree. So, the next logical step is to read a targeted window from that order. Since it's a large document (70k tokens), I should read a relevant section. But the user hasn't provided any context yet, so I need to either read the whole document or use a regex search to find \"decree\" or \"duration\" patterns.\n\nThe system's policy says to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. The checklist item is about \"duration of decree,\" so a regex like r'(?i)duration|term|length|period' might help. But the user's example uses \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" as the key, so the pattern should look for terms related to duration in court orders.\n\nWait, the requirement is to extract the duration as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So the regex should target phrases that include the duration. Maybe a pattern like r'(?i)(\\d+\\s*(?:years?|months?|days?|years?|months?|days?|indefinite|permanent))' but the user might need to search for the actual text.\n\nAlternatively, since the document is an order, the decree duration might be in the order text. The \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" (ECF No. 178) was mentioned in the Final Judgment, so it's probably the document that specifies the decree terms.\n\nGiven that, the next action should be to search that specific document for duration-related terms. So using `search_document_regex` with `doc_name` set to \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" and a pattern like r'decree duration|term of decree|duration of the decree|injunction duration' to find relevant sections.\n\nWait, the parameters for `search_document_regex` allow `doc_name` as a single name or 'all'. Since we're targeting one document, set `doc_name` to \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" and the pattern to something like r'\\b(duration|term|period|length)\\b' to find those words. Then, the top_k matches will give context around those terms, which can be read next.\n\nBut the user's example in the system prompt uses precise patterns. Let's make sure the pattern is anchored to document structure. Maybe the order mentions \"the decree shall remain in effect for X years\" so the pattern could be r'for\\s+\\d+\\s+(years|months|days)'. But to be safe, a broader regex that captures the term and surrounding context.\n\nSo, the correct action here is to use `search_document_regex` on the \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" document with a pattern that matches duration terms. Then, based on the search results, read the specific sections to extract the exact value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\", \"pattern\": \"(?i)duration|term|period|length|injunction duration\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 3, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment", "pattern": "(?i)duration|term|period|length|injunction duration", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 3, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3818, "completion_tokens": 913, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which requires the duration of court-ordered decrees, like injunctions or consent decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, the key is empty. The documents that have been checked so far are \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" (fully visited, tokens 0-339) and \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" (partially visited, with some tokens read). The other 7 documents are unvisited.\n\nIn Step 2, they read the Final Judgment, but that document seems to be a summary judgment entry, not a decree with a duration. The text mentions \"Final Judgment\" but doesn't specify any duration for a decree. The order says the plaintiff takes nothing, so maybe there's no decree here. The user's Step 3 used a regex search on the Order document for terms like duration, term, etc., but the matches found didn't have actual duration values. The matches were about protest times (3:00-6:00 p.m.) but those are event times, not court-ordered decree durations.\n\nSo, the next step should be to check other documents. The available documents include Complaints (First, Second, Third Amended), Docket, Order Granting Dismissal, and Mediation Report. The Complaints might mention any decrees, but usually, complaints are the initial filings. The Docket could have entries about orders. The Mediation Report might mention settlement terms, but the checklist specifies court-ordered decrees, not negotiated agreements.\n\nThe regex search was done on the Order document, but the matches didn't yield the needed info. The next logical step is to read more of the Order document since it's partially visited. The Order on Cross Motions has 70k tokens, and only 1% was viewed. The regex matches found were in the middle, but maybe the actual decree duration is mentioned elsewhere. However, the regex pattern used was for duration-related terms, and the matches didn't have the values. Wait, the regex pattern was \"(?i)duration|term|period|length|injunction duration\", so it's looking for those words. The matches found in the Order document's tokens 1657-1857, etc., but the text snippets don't include any duration values. For example, the first match talks about protest times (3:00-6:00), but that's not a court decree duration.\n\nSince the Order document is partially visited, maybe reading more of it could find the relevant part. The user should read a larger section of the Order document where the decree duration might be mentioned. The current viewed tokens are 1657-1857, 3478-3678, 6736-6936. The next unvisited token range could be checked. But the problem is that the regex search already looked for those terms and didn't find them, so maybe the duration isn't in that document. Alternatively, maybe the regex pattern wasn't precise enough. Wait, the pattern was for \"injunction duration\" as a phrase, but maybe the actual text uses \"duration\" or \"term\" in a different context.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies that the decree duration must be for court-ordered decrees. The Final Judgment document didn't have it, and the Order on Cross Motions might not have it either. The next step is to check other documents. The Complaints might not have decrees, but the Docket could list orders. The Docket is an unvisited document with 24k tokens. Maybe the Docket has entries that mention the decree duration. Alternatively, the Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss might have a decree.\n\nWait, the Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss is a document type that could include court orders, possibly with duration. Since the current unvisited documents include that, it's a candidate. But the user should prioritize documents that are more likely to contain the decree. The Final Judgment was a judgment on the merits, but it's a judgment against the plaintiff, so maybe there's no decree. The Order on Cross Motions is about summary judgment, so the actual decree might be in the Final Judgment, but that document's text didn't mention any duration.\n\nWait, the Final Judgment says \"Final Judgment is entered against Plaintiff... individual Defendants shall go hence without day.\" No mention of a decree duration. So that's not it.\n\nThe Order on Cross Motions is the order granting summary judgment, but the actual decree might be in the Final Judgment. But the Final Judgment is already read and has no duration.\n\nSo maybe the decree duration isn't in these documents. But the user needs to check all possibilities. The next step is to check other documents. The available documents include the Docket, which lists all court entries. The Docket might have a separate order that specifies the decree duration. For example, if there's a consent decree, the Docket might list it with a duration.\n\nSo, the Docket document (24,237 tokens) is unvisited. Reading that could be a good next step. Alternatively, the Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss might have a decree. But the Order on Cross Motions was partially read, but the regex didn't find the duration. Wait, the regex search was done on the Order document, but maybe the duration is mentioned in a different part. The user read some tokens but maybe missed it. However, the regex matches didn't include the duration value, so it's possible it's not there.\n\nAnother possibility: the Mediation Report might mention a settlement, but the checklist says only court-ordered decrees, not settlements. So if the Mediation Report talks about a settlement agreement, that's not applicable. But if there's a court-ordered decree from mediation, maybe. But the checklist specifies \"court-ordered,\" so settlement terms wouldn't count.\n\nGiven that, the most likely candidates are the Docket or the Order documents. Since the Order document was partially read and the regex didn't find anything, maybe check the Docket next. The Docket is a standard document that lists all filings and orders, so it might reference the decree duration.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so using read_document on it. The token count is 24,237, so they can read the entire document (since 24k < 10k max? Wait, no: the read_document allows up to 10,000 tokens per call. So they need to read in chunks. But the user can start with tokens 0-10,000 first.\n\nWait, the problem says \"read_document\" with a token range ≤10,000. So for the Docket (24k tokens), they can read first 10k tokens. So the next action is read_document on Docket, tokens 0-10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search the Docket with a regex pattern. But the user has to choose one action. Since the Docket is unvisited, and the previous regex didn't find it, maybe reading it directly is better.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about the decree duration. The decree might be part of a consent decree, which could be in the Docket. So reading the Docket's first 10k tokens makes sense. That's the most efficient next step.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4618, "completion_tokens": 1628, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The previous steps have read \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" (tokens 0-339) and \"Docket\" (0-10000), and searched \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\" with a regex pattern.

But the Docket document has a lot of entries, so maybe the decree duration is in there.\n\nWait, the Docket document's content shows entries like \"FINAL JUDGMENT AS TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS\" but the actual judgment text (from Step 2) doesn't mention a duration. The judgment says \"Final Judgment is entered against Plaintiff... individual Defendants shall go hence without day.\" So no duration mentioned there.\n\nThe Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment was searched with regex patterns like \"duration|term|period\", but the matches found don't seem to contain the actual decree duration. The matches were about protest times (3:00-6:00 p.m.) or crowd sizes, not court-ordered decrees.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss\" is unvisited, but maybe the decree duration is in a different document. Wait, the checklist says \"only include obligations that are ordered by the court,\" so maybe the Final Judgment doesn't have a duration because it's a dismissal. The user mentioned \"decree\" as a formal court order, so if the judgment is a dismissal without a decree, then maybe this item is Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to confirm. The Final Judgment says \"Plaintiff shall take nothing by this action as to the individual Defendants and the individual Defendants shall go hence without day.\" So it's a dismissal, not a decree with a duration. The other documents might not have any decree. The Complaint and Amended Complaints are pleadings, not judgments. The Mediation Report might not have it either.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says \"for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" The Final Judgment here is a dismissal, not an injunction or decree. So maybe there's no decree duration to extract. But I need to make sure no other documents have such a decree.\n\nThe next logical step is to check the \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss\" document. But the user's current available documents list that as unvisited. However, the regex search on the Order on Cross Motions didn't find anything. Maybe the decree duration isn't present in any document, so the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut according to the Not Applicable encoding, I need to have explicit evidence. The Final Judgment is a dismissal, so there's no decree. The checklist specifies \"only include obligations that are ordered by the court,\" so if there's no such order, it's Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 2 read the Final Judgment, which says \"Final Judgment is entered,\" but it's a dismissal. So there's no decree with a duration. Therefore, the correct action is to set \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" to Not Applicable with evidence from the Final Judgment.\n\nSo the next action should be `update_checklist` with the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" and the value \"Not Applicable\", using the evidence from the Final Judgment text. The evidence would be the part where it says \"Plaintiff shall take nothing by this action...\" indicating no decree was issued, just a dismissal.\n\nI should check if there's any other document that might have a decree. But the Docket shows the Final Judgment as the only judgment document. The other documents are motions, complaints, etc., which don't typically include decree durations. So yes, it's Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use `update_checklist` to set that key to Not Applicable with the evidence from the Final Judgment.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 and in accordance with the Court’s September 4, 2024 Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment, [ECF No. 178], it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Final Judgment is entered against Plaintiff, Latoya Ratlieff, and in favor of individual Defendants ...

The evidence cited is from the Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants, which states that the judgment was entered against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendants, with the plaintiff taking nothing by the action. The court didn't impose any ongoing obligations or decrees; it's a dismissal of the plaintiff's claims against the individual defendants.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to make sure that there's no other document that might contain a decree duration. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value, so if there's any court order with a duration, it should be included. The current state says \"Not Applicable\" because the Final Judgment doesn't have any duration mentioned. But maybe other documents like the Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment or other orders could have a decree duration.\n\nThe available documents include several unvisited ones: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Third Amended Complaint, Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss, and Mediation Report. The Docket and Order on Cross Motions have been partially read, but the key documents for decrees might be the orders or judgments.\n\nThe user's last action was updating the checklist to \"Not Applicable\" based on the Final Judgment. However, the Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 178) might have more details. The search_document_regex was run with patterns like \"duration\" but found only three matches, none of which mentioned decree duration. The matches were about the factual record, protests, and crowd descriptions.\n\nBut maybe the \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss\" (ECF 48) could have a decree. The document mentions granting the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint and denying the motions to dismiss. However, the order doesn't specify any decree duration; it's about the pleadings. The Final Judgment (ECF 179) is the only document that might have a decree, but it's a dismissal, not a decree.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies \"for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" The Final Judgment here is a dismissal, not an injunction or decree. So there's no decree in the case, hence \"Not Applicable\" is correct.\n\nBut the user should verify if any other documents contain a decree. The Mediation Report (550 tokens) is unvisited. Maybe it has a consent decree. The user hasn't read that yet. The checklist says to extract from any document, so checking the Mediation Report might be necessary.\n\nThe current status shows all keys as Not Applicable (1 key), but the user needs to confirm there's no decree in any document. The Mediation Report is a possible candidate. Since it's unvisited, the next step should be to read that document to check for any decree duration.\n\nThe document catalog shows Mediation Report is unvisited (○ Unvisited). So the next action should be to read_document on Mediation Report. The token count is 550, so reading the entire document (0-550) would be efficient.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions included reading the Docket (0-10000), but the Mediation Report hasn't been accessed. The checklist requires checking all documents. Since the Mediation Report is a possible source of a consent decree (as mediation might lead to a settlement with a decree), it's worth checking.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document on Mediation Report for tokens 0-550.

The evidence they used was from the Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants, where the court entered judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendants, stating that the plaintiff takes nothing by the action. The key point here is that there's no decree or injunction mentioned; it's a dismissal of the case, so there's no court-ordered decree with a duration.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to make sure that there's no other document that might contain a decree duration. The current status says all keys are either filled or Not Applicable, but they have to confirm if any other documents might have relevant info. The available documents include several complaints (Complaint, First Amended, etc.), but those are pleadings, not court orders with decrees. The Mediation Report mentions a settlement, but that's a settlement agreement, not a court-ordered decree. The Final Judgment is the only document that actually has a court order, and it's a dismissal without any decree.\n\nThe user has already used `update_checklist` to set the key to Not Applicable. Now, they need to check if there's any other document that might have a decree. The other documents listed are complaints, which are filed by the plaintiff and don't contain court decrees. The Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 178) was referenced in the Final Judgment, but the search they did there didn't find any duration terms. The regex search for \"duration\" etc. in that document returned matches that were about the timeline of events, not the decree duration.\n\nThe Docket has a lot of entries, but it's just a chronological log of filings, not the actual court orders. The Mediation Report talks about settlement, not a decree. So, no other documents seem to contain a court-ordered decree with a duration. The Final Judgment is the only one that would have a decree, and since it's a dismissal, there's no decree. Therefore, \"Not Applicable\" is correct.\n\nThey should check if there's any remaining document that might have a decree. The available documents show that the Complaint, First Amended, etc., are unvisited, but those are complaints, not decrees. The Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss is also unvisited, but that's an order dismissing part of the case, not a decree. So even if they read those, they probably won't find a decree duration.\n\nSince they've already confirmed that the Final Judgment has no decree (hence Not Applicable), and all other documents are either unvisited but unlikely to contain the needed info or are not court orders, the next step is to stop. The checklist key is correctly marked as Not Applicable with evidence, and there's no more documents to check that could provide a decree duration.\n\nWait, the user's step 5 was an `update_checklist` setting it to Not Applicable, and step 6 was reading the Mediation Report. The Mediation Report doesn't add any new info about a decree duration. So, all possible documents have been checked. The Docket was partially read, but it's just a log. The Order on Cross Motions was searched and didn't have the info. The other documents are complaints, which don't contain decrees.\n\nSo, the correct action here is to stop because the key is properly marked as Not Applicable with evidence, and no further documents will provide a decree duration. There's no need to read more documents or do anything else.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are resolved: 'How_Long_Decrees_will_Last' is marked as Not Applicable with evidence from Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants (dismissal without court-ordered decree).

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already marked \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" as Not Applicable. The evidence comes from the Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants, where it says \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58... it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that F...\" but the actual decree duration isn't specified. The note says it's a dismissal without court-ordered decree, so there's no decree to have a duration.\n\nThe user's task is to check if there are any other documents that might contain decree duration info. The available documents include Docket (partially read), Order on Cross Motions (partially read), Mediation Report (fully read), and several complaints (unvisited). \n\nThe Mediation Report (Step 6) shows a settlement, but it's a settlement, not a court-ordered decree. The key point is that the decree duration only applies to court-ordered decrees, not settlements. So the Mediation Report doesn't provide a decree duration.\n\nThe Docket and Order on Cross Motions were partially read, but the prior steps already processed the relevant parts. The Docket has dates and orders, but no mention of decree duration. The Order on Cross Motions was searched for terms like \"duration\" but found no matches that would indicate a decree duration.\n\nThe other complaints (Complaint, First Amended, etc.) are unvisited, but they're complaints, not court orders. The checklist specifies \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" Complaints are filed by the plaintiff, not court orders, so they won't contain decree durations.\n\nThe system already set \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" to Not Applicable with evidence from the Final Judgment. The Final Judgment is a court order, but it's a dismissal without a decree, so there's no duration to extract. The evidence provided in Step 5 is valid.\n\nSince all documents have been checked (the ones that could possibly contain the info), and no decree duration was found, the Not Applicable is correctly set. The system has already marked it as Not Applicable, and the checklist status shows it's filled. The user's next action should be to stop, as all keys are resolved.\n\nThe current status says 1/1 keys filled, 0 empty, 1 Not Applicable. So there's nothing left to extract. The stop attempt is the second one, but the system says it's stop attempt 1/2, so I need to confirm again. But since all items are handled, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are resolved: 'How_Long_Decrees_will_Last' is marked as Not Applicable with evidence from Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants (dismissal without court-ordered decree).
