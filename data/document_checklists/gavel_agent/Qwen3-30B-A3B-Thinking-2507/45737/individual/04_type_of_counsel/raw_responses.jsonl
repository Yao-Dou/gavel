Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and all documents are unvisited. The task is to find all distinct values of counsel types, including specific organizations in parentheses, and separate entries for plaintiff and defendant if both are present.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where to look for this information. In legal documents, the type of counsel is often mentioned in the complaint, especially in the introductory parts where the parties are listed. The Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Second, and Third Amended Complaints are all possible places. The Docket might have some info too, but the complaints are more likely to have the initial counsel details.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The user should start by reading one of the complaint documents. The Complaint (19k tokens) is the smallest among the complaints, so it's a good starting point. Reading the first part of the Complaint might reveal the counsel information. Since the token limit for read_document is 10k, I'll read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint to check for counsel types.\n\nI need to make sure not to read beyond the first 10k tokens. The document is 19k, so reading start_token 0 to 10000 should cover the beginning. The location would be \"first 10k tokens\" or similar. The evidence will need to include the exact text snippet, document name, and location.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint from 0 to 10000 tokens. That's the most efficient way to start gathering evidence for Type_of_Counsel.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3432, "completion_tokens": 394, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist item specifies that I should get the type of counsel for each side, like Plaintiff or Defendant, using brief categories and including specific organizations if available.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the only one read so far is the Complaint (tokens 0-10000). The Complaint is the initial filing by the Plaintiff, Latoya Ratlieff. The document mentions her as the Plaintiff, but it doesn't explicitly state the type of counsel. The complaint is filed by her, but the attorney's name or firm isn't mentioned in the text provided. The user's task is to extract the type of counsel, so if the attorney's information isn't in the complaint, I might need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that Step 2 was reading the Complaint up to token 10000. The text from the Complaint doesn't mention the attorney's name or type. For example, in the complaint, it's \"Plaintiff, Latoya Ratlieff,\" but there's no mention of her lawyer. So, the type of counsel isn't stated here. \n\nThe available documents include other complaints (Amended Complaints) and other types like Docket, Orders, etc. The next logical step would be to check if the Docket or another document has the attorney information. But according to the document catalog, the Docket is unvisited (○ Unvisited), and it's 24,237 tokens. The Docket might list the attorneys, as docket entries often include counsel names.\n\nSince the current read didn't find the counsel type, I should look for another document. The Docket is a good candidate because it's likely to have the attorney information. The next action should be to read the Docket document. But the user's policy says to read only unvisited documents or unvisited token ranges. The Docket is marked as ○ Unvisited, so I should read it. However, the maximum read is 10,000 tokens. The Docket is 24k tokens, so reading the first 10k tokens would be the first step.\n\nWait, but maybe the Docket is the right place. The Docket typically lists the attorneys. So, I should call read_document on the Docket, starting at 0-10000 tokens. That's the next step. The user hasn't found any counsel type yet, so moving to the Docket makes sense. The Complaint didn't have it, so checking the Docket is the next logical move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Mediation Report or other documents have it, but the Docket is more likely. The system's policy says to choose a document likely to contain the target value. The Docket is the most probable place for counsel info. So the next action is read_document on Docket (tokens 0-10000).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14047, "completion_tokens": 659, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Type_of_Counsel\", which requires the type of counsel representing each side, using specific categories like private counsel, public interest nonprofit, etc. If both sides are represented, they should be listed as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'.\n\nFirst, I need to check the documents that have been read so far. The recent actions show that they've read the Complaint (tokens 0-10000) and the Docket (tokens 0-10000). Let me look through those to find any mention of counsel types.\n\nStarting with the Complaint. The document starts with the case details, and the plaintiff is LaToya Ratlieff. The defendants are the City of Fort Lauderdale and several officers. But the Complaint itself is the initial filing. In legal documents, the type of counsel is often mentioned in the caption, the filing, or in the attorney appearances.\n\nLooking through the Complaint text provided, I don't see any explicit mention of the type of counsel. The Complaint is filed by \"LaToya Ratlieff\" and the attorneys listed in the docket might be in the Docket document.\n\nNow, the Docket document. The Docket shows entries like \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" This indicates that the City is represented by Jeffery Rodman Lawley, who is part of a law firm. But what type of counsel is that? The Docket also has entries like \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of Paul Cristafaro, Herns Eugene, etc.\" So the defendants (the City and individual officers) are represented by the same attorney, Jeffery Rodman Lawley. \n\nAnother entry: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" The attorney's name is Jeffery Rodman Lawley, and he's appearing for the City. The law firm isn't specified here, but the type of counsel would likely be \"private counsel\" since it's a law firm representing the City. However, sometimes government entities are represented by government counsel, but the City of Fort Lauderdale is a municipal government, so their counsel would typically be city attorneys or a law firm retained by the city. But in the Docket, it's listed as \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance,\" which suggests private counsel.\n\nWait, the plaintiff is LaToya Ratlieff. In the Docket entries, there's \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City...\" but what about the plaintiff's counsel? Let me check the Docket again. The first entry is \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\" and then \"NOTICE by LaToya Ratlieff re 1 Complaint... (Attachments: #1 Civil Cover Sheet, #2 Summon(s) Summons - City of Fort Lauderdale, Cristafaro, Eugene, Figueras, Greenlaw, Ramos, Smith) (Davis, Michael) (Entered: 06/01/2022)\".\n\nSo the plaintiff's attorney is Michael Davis. The entry says \"filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\" and later \"NOTICE... filed by LaToya Ratlieff (Davis, Michael)\". So the plaintiff is represented by Michael Davis. The type of counsel here would be \"private counsel\" since it's a private attorney, not a government attorney or public interest group.\n\nNow, the checklist says to format each side as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. So the plaintiff's counsel is Michael Davis (private counsel), and the defendants are represented by Jeffery Rodman Lawley (private counsel for the City and individual officers). Wait, but the defendants are multiple: the City and individual officers. The City is a municipal government, so their counsel might be city counsel, but the Docket shows an attorney appearance for the City, so it's likely a private firm retained by the city. So the defendant side's counsel is private counsel.\n\nWait, but the checklist says to include specific organizations if available. Here, the attorney is Jeffery Rodman Lawley, but the law firm isn't named. The Docket entries just say \"Jeffery Rodman Lawley\" without the firm. So the type would be \"private counsel\" without a specific organization mentioned.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for the plaintiff's attorney is \"Davis, Michael\" and for the defendants, \"Lawley, Jeffery\". So the plaintiff's counsel is Michael Davis (private counsel), and the defendants' counsel is Jeffery Rodman Lawley (private counsel). So both sides are represented by private counsel.\n\nBut the checklist says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". So the values would be:\n\n- Plaintiff: private counsel\n- Defendant: private counsel\n\nBut wait, the checklist also says \"including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". Since the specific law firm isn't mentioned in the Docket entries provided, we can't include it. So the entries would just be \"private counsel\" for both.\n\nWait, but the Docket entries for the attorney appearances don't mention the law firm, so we can't assume. So the value is \"private counsel\" for both sides.\n\nNow, check if there are any other documents that might have more info, but the current task is to extract from the provided documents. The user has read the Complaint and Docket, and the other documents are unvisited. But the Docket has the attorney appearances, which are key.\n\nSo from the Docket, the plaintiff is represented by Michael Davis (private counsel), and the defendants are represented by Jeffery Rodman Lawley (private counsel). So the Type_of_Counsel should have two entries: \"Plaintiff: private counsel\" and \"Defendant: private counsel\".\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"the type(s) of counsel representing each side\". So each side's counsel type. The plaintiff's side is one, the defendant's side is another. So two entries.\n\nNow, evidence for each. For Plaintiff: the Docket entry \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\" shows that the attorney is Davis, Michael, so private counsel. The document entry \"NOTICE by LaToya Ratlieff re 1 Complaint... (Davis, Michael)\" confirms the attorney.\n\nFor Defendant: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" and similar for other defendants. So the attorney for the defendants is Jeffery Rodman Lawley, so private counsel.\n\nSo the extracted values are:\n\n- Plaintiff: private counsel\n- Defendant: private counsel\n\nEach with evidence from the Docket document.\n\nNow, check if the Type_of_Counsel is empty. The current status says \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so it's empty. So we need to extract these values.\n\nThe next step is to append these to the checklist. Since we have two values, we need to use append_checklist to add them. Each entry needs evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nFor Plaintiff:\n- Value: \"Plaintiff: private counsel\"\n- Evidence: The text \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\" from the Docket document, location \"Docket entry 1\".\n\nFor Defendant:\n- Value: \"Defendant: private counsel\"\n- Evidence: The text \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" from the Docket document, location \"Docket entry 21\".\n\nWait, the Docket entries: Entry 21 is \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" So that's the evidence for defendant counsel.\n\nEntry 1 is the Complaint filing with Davis, Michael, so that's plaintiff counsel.\n\nSo the evidence for Plaintiff is from Docket entry 1, and Defendant from Docket entry 21.\n\nNow, the action should be to append these two entries using append_checklist.\n\nCheck the parameters for append_checklist: it's an array of patches. Each patch has a key and an extracted list of entries (each with evidence and value).\n\nSo the patch would be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Plaintiff: private counsel\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants. Filing fee $402.00 receipt number AFLSDC-15679987, filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket entry 1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Defendant: private counsel\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket entry 21\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Type_of_Counsel\", so the key is exactly that. The extracted list should have these two entries.\n\nThe user's recent actions have read the Docket, so the evidence is from the Docket document, which is partially visited (tokens 0-10000). But since the text is in the first 10,000 tokens (which were read), it's okay.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the two entries.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", and here the values are two separate entries (Plaintiff and Defendant), so both should be added.\n\nNow, check if the Type_of_Counsel is the only key. Yes, based on the current status.\n\nSo the correct action is to call append_checklist with those two entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: private counsel\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Complaint pursuant to 42 USC 1983 against All Defendants.

The user is asking me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from legal documents, specifically looking for distinct values for plaintiff and defendant sides. \n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The checklist already has two entries from the Docket document: \"Plaintiff: private counsel\" and \"Defendant: private counsel\". The evidence points to Docket entries 1 and 21.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint was partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the Docket was also partially read (0-10000). The key here is that the Docket entries 1 and 21 are sufficient to confirm the counsel types. \n\nWait, but I should verify if there are more entries. The Docket entry 1 says \"filed by LaToya Ratlieff.(Davis, Michael)\" - that's clearly private counsel for plaintiff. Entry 21 mentions \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by Jeffery Rodman Lawley on behalf of City of Fort Lauderdale\" - that's private counsel for defendant. \n\nThe other documents like First Amended Complaint or Order Granting Motions to Dismiss might have more attorney appearances, but the current evidence already covers both sides. The checklist only requires \"every distinct value\" found in any document. Since we've got both plaintiff and defendant covered with private counsel, and the instructions say not to include entries if unclear, we don't need to check further.\n\nThe user's recent action was an append_checklist that successfully added these two values. Now I need to confirm if there's anything else to extract. The current status shows 2 values extracted, and the checklist has only one key. \n\nChecking the document coverage: Complaint and Docket are partially visited, but we've already read the relevant parts in Docket. The other documents (like First Amended Complaint) might have more counsel info, but the instructions say \"extract EVERY distinct value\" - meaning we should check if there are additional values beyond what's already found. However, the two values we have are already distinct and cover both sides. \n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as separate values\". We have both sides covered. The evidence is solid from Docket entries. No need to read more documents because we've got all required values. \n\nThe Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here since both sides have clear counsel types.
