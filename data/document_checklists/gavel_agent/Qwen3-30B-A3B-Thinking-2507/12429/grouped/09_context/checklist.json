In violation of DHS policy and reasonable professional standards limiting shelter stays for children under five years old to a maximum of twenty-four hours, DHS kept D.G. languishing in the shelter for at least twenty-two days. In September of 2007, due to inadequate supervision by DHS at the overcrowded Mayer Emergency Shelter, a DHS worker carrying D.G. and another infant at the same time dropped D.G. who was then less than a month old and he fell and struck his head on the floor. DHS did not take D.G. to the hospital until the next day, where he was diagnosed with a fractured skull."
