            "text": "When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010, millions of Americans gained access to affordable, comprehensive health care for the first time. Individuals could seek the medical care they needed, when they needed it, and medical providers across the country were better able to provide optimal treatment to their patients. One of the ways the ACA has achieved this result is through the establishment of health insurance Exchanges, where individuals can identify and enroll in affordable insurance policies that meet their health care needs. To ensure lower costs for more comprehensive coverage, the ACA subsidizes the costs of that coverage, which leads younger and healthier individuals to the insurance market, improving the risk pool and lowering premiums for everyone. And the ACA guarantees that individuals are not denied coverage because of a pre-existing health condition or discriminated against based on their history of insurance coverage."

            "text": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has now published a final rule, purportedly pursuant to the ACA, whose effects will be directly contrary to that landmark legislation. That rule\u2014entitled \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability\u201d (2025 Rule), 90 Fed. Reg. 27,074\u2014purports to \u201cstrengthen[] the integrity of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) eligibility and enrollment systems to reduce waste, fraud and abuse\u201d and \u201cprovide emergent relief from rising improper enrollment and health care costs.\u201d Id. at 27,074. But the rule accomplishes the opposite. Rather than reducing the cost of insurance for consumers, or increasing their enrollment rates and benefits, Defendants\u2019 new policies will cause at least 1.8 million Americans to lose coverage on the ACA\u2019s health insurance Exchanges in 2026 alone and will ultimately result in higher premiums in the long term and higher out-of-pocket costs for the remaining enrollees."

During the first Trump presidency, the Administration vowed to \u201cwatch Obamacare go down the tubes.\u201d1 Previously, in a 2019 rule, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (Apr. 17, 2018), CMS and HHS attempted to contravene the ACA with proposals that would have eliminated many of the ACA\u2019s guarantees, deterred consumers from enrolling in quality health insurance plans, and increased out-of-pocket costs, similar to the 2025 Rule. This Court responded to those efforts, vacating and remanding portions of the rule as arbitrary and capricious."
