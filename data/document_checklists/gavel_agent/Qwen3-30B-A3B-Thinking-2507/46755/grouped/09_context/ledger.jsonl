Individuals could seek the medical care they needed, when they needed it, and medical providers across the country were better able to provide optimal treatment to their patients. One of the ways the ACA has achieved this result is through the establishment of health insurance Exchanges, where individuals can identify and enroll in affordable insurance policies that meet their health care needs. To ensure lower costs for more comprehensive coverage, the ACA subsidizes the costs of that coverage, which leads younger and healthier individuals to the insurance market, improving the risk pool and lowering premiums for everyone. And the ACA guarantees that individuals are not denied coverage because of a pre-existing health condition or discriminated against based on their history of insurance coverage.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 3 of 30"}], "value": "ACA enacted in 2010 to provide affordable health care access, including subsidies, pre-existing condition protections, and health insurance Exchanges"}, {"evidence": [{"text": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has now published a final rule, purportedly pursuant to the ACA, whose effects will be directly contrary to that landmark legislation.
