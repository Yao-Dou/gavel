            "text": "When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010, millions of Americans gained access to affordable, comprehensive health care for the first time. Individuals could seek the medical care they needed, when they needed it, and medical providers across the country were better able to provide optimal treatment to their patients. One of the ways the ACA has achieved this result is through the establishment of health insurance Exchanges, where individuals can identify and enroll in affordable insurance policies that meet their health care needs. To ensure lower costs for more comprehensive coverage, the ACA subsidizes the costs of that coverage, which leads younger and healthier individuals to the insurance market, improving the risk pool and lowering premiums for everyone. And the ACA guarantees that individuals are not denied coverage because of a pre-existing health condition or discriminated against based on their history of insurance coverage."

During the first Trump presidency, the Administration vowed to 'watch Obamacare go down the tubes.' Previously, in a 2019 rule, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (Apr. 17, 2018), CMS and HHS attempted to contravene the ACA with proposals that would have eliminated many of the ACA\u2019s guarantees, deterred consumers from enrolling in quality health insurance plans, and increased out-of-pocket costs, similar to the 2025 Rule. This Court responded to those efforts, vacating and remanding portions of the rule as arbitrary and capricious."

Cloaked in the pretense of government efficiency and fraud prevention, the 2025 Rule creates numerous barriers to affordable insurance coverage, negating the ACA\u2019s goal of extending affordable health coverage to all Americans, and instead increasing the population of underinsured and uninsured Americans. Many of the 2025 Rule\u2019s provisions are in direct conflict with federal law. And many of its provisions are arbitrary, having been promulgated without observance of proper procedure, reasonable explanation, or meaningful response to public comments, and without consideration of the harm the Rule will impose on the millions of consumers whose health and wellbeing depend on access to affordable coverage and, ultimately, on the American public."
