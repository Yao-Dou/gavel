Individuals could seek the medical care they needed, when they needed it, and medical providers across the country were better able to provide optimal treatment to their patients. One of the ways the ACA has achieved this result is through the establishment of health insurance Exchanges, where individuals can identify and enroll in affordable insurance policies that meet their health care needs. To ensure lower costs for more comprehensive coverage, the ACA subsidizes the costs of that coverage, which leads younger and healthier individuals to the insurance market, improving the risk pool and lowering premiums for everyone. And the ACA guarantees that individuals are not denied coverage because of a pre-existing health condition or discriminated against based on their history of insurance coverage.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 3"}], "value": "ACA enacted in 2010 established health insurance Exchanges, subsidized coverage, guaranteed pre-existing condition coverage"}, {"evidence": [{"text": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has now published a final rule, purportedly pursuant to the ACA, whose effects will be directly contrary to that landmark legislation.

Reg. 16,930 (Apr. 17, 2018), CMS and HHS attempted to contravene the ACA with proposals that would have eliminated many of the ACA\u2019s guarantees, deterred consumers from enrolling in quality health insurance plans, and increased out-of-pocket costs, similar to the 2025 Rule.

Many of the 2025 Rule\u2019s provisions are in direct conflict with federal law.
