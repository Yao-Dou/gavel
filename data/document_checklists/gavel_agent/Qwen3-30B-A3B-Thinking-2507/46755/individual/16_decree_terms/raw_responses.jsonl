Since there are no documents listed, I need to use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none, those can't be used yet.

The user needs to extract all distinct significant terms of decrees from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. Important to note that terms from settlement agreements only count if they're expressly incorporated into the court order.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available documents. There are four: Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and an Untitled Document. All are unvisited (marked with ○). The current status shows 0 values extracted for the checklist item, so I need to find where the decree terms might be.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is the most likely candidate since it's a court opinion that would include the court's order. The Complaint might have claims but not the decree terms. The Docket might list case events but not the detailed terms. The Untitled Document is vague, but maybe it's a settlement agreement. However, the requirement says to only include terms incorporated into the court order, so the Memorandum Opinion is the priority.\n\nI should start by reading the Memorandum Opinion. Since it's 47k tokens, I can't read the whole thing at once. The maximum per read is 10k tokens. I'll start with the beginning, maybe the section where the court's order is stated. Typically, court opinions have the order at the end. But to be safe, I'll read the first 10k tokens to see if there's any mention of decrees or orders.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" specifically. The Memorandum Opinion should have the court's ruling, so the decree terms would be in there. Let me confirm the document names: \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion] is listed. That's the right document.\n\nSo the next action should be to read_document for the Memorandum Opinion, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. I need to make sure not to reread any tokens, but since it's unvisited, all tokens are new. So start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nI should not use search_document_regex yet because the user hasn't specified a pattern. The checklist item is about the terms themselves, which might not have a clear regex pattern. Better to read the document first to find where the decree terms are mentioned.\n\nAlso, the Docket might have the order, but the Memorandum Opinion is more likely to contain the detailed terms. So prioritizing that document makes sense. Let's go with read_document on the Memorandum Opinion for the first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3287, "completion_tokens": 618, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and there are 4 documents available. The Memorandum Opinion has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the other documents are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the provided text from the Memorandum Opinion, I need to find any court-ordered terms that are part of the decree. The case is about a stay of certain provisions of the Rule. The court granted a stay enjoining certain provisions from taking effect on August 25, 2025. The key part here is where it says \"the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs' Motion and enters a STAY enjoining certain provisions of the Rule from taking effect on August 25, 2025.\"\n\nSo the significant terms of the decree would be the specific provisions that are enjoined. The text mentions \"seven provisions\" where the court found likelihood of success. However, the actual terms aren't listed in the excerpt provided. The document says the court found that seven provisions were enjoined, but the specific terms aren't detailed here. The excerpt stops at a point where the analysis is ongoing.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says to extract the substantive obligations ordered by the court. The stay is an order, so the terms would be the specific provisions that are stayed. But in the given text, it's not specified which seven provisions. The document mentions \"seven provisions of the Rule\" but doesn't list them. So maybe the specific terms aren't in this document, or perhaps they are referenced elsewhere.\n\nSince the Memorandum Opinion is only partially read (up to 10,000 tokens), maybe the actual list of provisions is in the remaining tokens. But the user's task is to extract based on what's provided. The current read is up to page 16, and the text cuts off. The next step would be to read more of the Memorandum Opinion to find the specific terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stay order is the decree, and the terms are the injunctions against the seven provisions. But the checklist requires extracting each term as a separate value. However, without knowing which specific provisions are being enjoined, I can't list them. The document says \"seven provisions\" but doesn't name them here. So perhaps the actual terms are in the court's order, which might be a separate document.\n\nLooking at the available documents: there's a Memorandum Opinion (partially read), Complaint, Docket, and an Untitled Document. The Memorandum Opinion is the main opinion, but the actual order might be in the Docket or another document. The Docket is unvisited, so maybe the order details are there.\n\nWait, the Docket document is listed as [Docket], which typically contains the court's orders. So maybe the specific terms are in the Docket. Since the Memorandum Opinion mentions the stay but doesn't list the provisions, the Docket might have the actual order with the terms.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document, which is unvisited. The Docket has 4,335 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the entire document would be possible with one read_document call. Alternatively, maybe the Docket has a summary of the order, so reading it could provide the specific terms.\n\nAlternatively, the Memorandum Opinion might have the terms in the part that's not yet read (beyond token 10,000). But since the user provided up to token 10,000, and the text stops at page 16, maybe the actual injunction terms are in the remaining part. However, the user's snapshot shows that the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (21% coverage), so reading more tokens there could be an option. But the Docket seems more likely to contain the order details.\n\nWait, the Docket is a separate document. In legal contexts, the Docket lists all entries, including the court's orders. So the actual decree terms might be in the Docket. Therefore, the next step should be to read the Docket document to find the specific terms.\n\nThe available actions are to either read_document or search_document_regex. Since the key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and the Docket is the place where the order would be listed, reading the entire Docket (since it's only 4,335 tokens) would be efficient. So the correct action is to call read_document on the Docket, starting from 0 to 4335 tokens.\n\nWait, but the Docket is a small document, so reading it all at once is possible. The read_document function allows up to 10k tokens, and the Docket is 4,335 tokens. So the parameters would be doc_name: \"Docket\", start_token: 0, end_token: 4335.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket has a specific entry for the order. But since it's unvisited, reading it is the next step. The Memorandum Opinion was read partially, but the specific terms might not be there. So the next action should be to read the Docket.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4335}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4335}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13723, "completion_tokens": 1143, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The requirement is to extract every distinct value of this item, with each term as a separate entry, including evidence from the documents.\n\nLooking at the Docket document, which is fully read (tokens 0-4335), I need to check if there's any mention of decree terms. The Docket is a chronological list of court filings, so it's unlikely to contain the actual decree terms. The key terms would be in the Memorandum Opinion or the Order.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion was read up to token 10000, which is about 21% of the document. The text provided shows the opinion from the court, but the actual decree terms might be in the Order (Document 36 in the Docket). The Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) mentions the Court's decision to grant in part and deny in part the motion, but the specific terms of the decree are likely in the Order (Document 36).\n\nWait, the Docket entry 36 is \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\" But the actual text of the Order isn't in the Docket; the Docket just lists the entry. The Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) is the opinion explaining the decision, and the Order (Document 36) is the actual order. However, the user hasn't read Document 36 yet. The Memorandum Opinion (35) is the opinion, and the Order (36) is the separate document.\n\nWait, in the Docket, Document 35 is the Memorandum Opinion, and Document 36 is the Order. The user read Document 35 (Memorandum Opinion) up to token 10000, but the Order (Document 36) hasn't been read yet. The Order would contain the actual decree terms.\n\nSo, the next step should be to read the Order document. But the Order is listed as Document 36 in the Docket, but the available documents are:\n\n- Docket [Docket] - fully visited\n- Memorandum Opinion [Order/Opinion] - partially visited (0-10000)\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint] - unvisited\n- Untitled Document [Unknown] - unvisited\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion is Document 35, and the Order is Document 36, but in the available documents, the Order isn't listed as a separate document. Wait, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document is the one with the opinion, and the Order might be part of that or a separate document. But according to the Docket, Document 35 is Memorandum Opinion, Document 36 is the Order. However, in the available documents, the user has a \"Memorandum Opinion\" document (which is Document 35) and the Order (Document 36) isn't listed as a separate document in the catalog. Wait, the catalog shows:\n\nAvailable Documents:\n- Docket [Docket] - fully visited\n- Memorandum Opinion [Order/Opinion] - partially visited\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint] - unvisited\n- Untitled Document [Unknown] - unvisited\n\nSo the Order (Document 36) might be part of the Memorandum Opinion document, or perhaps it's the same as the Memorandum Opinion. Wait, in the Docket, Document 35 is the Memorandum Opinion, and Document 36 is the Order. But the Memorandum Opinion is a separate document from the Order. However, the catalog only lists \"Memorandum Opinion\" as a document, not the Order. Maybe the Order is included in the Memorandum Opinion document. Wait, the Memorandum Opinion is Document 35, and the Order is Document 36, but the catalog doesn't list the Order as a separate document. So perhaps the Order is part of the Memorandum Opinion document, or the user needs to read the Memorandum Opinion further.\n\nWait, the user read the Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) up to token 10000. The document is 47,265 tokens, so 21% is 10000 tokens. The actual Order might be at the end of the Memorandum Opinion document. The Memorandum Opinion text provided ends at page 16, but the document is 76 pages. The user needs to read further into the Memorandum Opinion to find the Order.\n\nAlternatively, the Order might be a separate document, but since it's not listed in the available documents, maybe it's included in the Memorandum Opinion. The Docket shows that Document 36 is the Order, but the catalog doesn't have a separate Order document. So the user should continue reading the Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) beyond token 10000 to find the Order.\n\nThe next action should be to read the next token range of the Memorandum Opinion. Since the current read was 0-10000, the next range should be 10000-20000, up to 10,000 tokens. So the next read_document call should be on Memorandum Opinion, start_token 10000, end_token 20000.\n\nWait, but the user should check if the Order is in the Memorandum Opinion. The Memorandum Opinion is the opinion, and the Order is a separate order, but sometimes they are combined. However, the Docket lists them as separate entries (35 and 36), so the Order might be a separate document. But since the catalog doesn't list it, maybe the user needs to check if the Order is part of the Memorandum Opinion. The user has to work with the documents provided.\n\nGiven the available documents, the next logical step is to read more of the Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) to see if the decree terms are there. The current read was 0-10000, so the next read should be 10000-20000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decree terms are in the Order (Document 36), but since it's not listed as a separate document, perhaps the user should read the Memorandum Opinion further. Let's check the provided text from the Memorandum Opinion. The text ends at page 16, which is part of the opinion, but the Order is typically at the end. So the Order might be in the remaining tokens of the Memorandum Opinion document.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the next 10,000 tokens (10000-20000) of the Memorandum Opinion.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18196, "completion_tokens": 1660, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The current status shows:\n- Docket is fully visited (4,335 tokens, 100% coverage)\n- Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (20,000 tokens out of 47,265)\n- Two documents are unvisited: Complaint and Untitled Document\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents (found 4 docs), Step 2 read Memorandum Opinion tokens 0-10,000, Step 3 read Docket 0-4335, Step 4 read Memorandum Opinion tokens 10,000-20,000.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these documents contain the decree terms. The Docket document is just a chronological log of filings - it's unlikely to contain substantive decree terms. The Memorandum Opinion is the court's decision document, which is where I'd expect to find the decree terms.\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Opinion content (tokens 0-20,000), I see it's a legal opinion discussing standing, merits of the case, and the court's decision. The key part I'm looking for is the actual decree terms. In the document, I see at the end of the opinion (in the Docket entry 36), there's an \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\"\n\nThis suggests the court issued an order granting a stay on some provisions. The actual decree terms would be in the order document, not the memorandum opinion. But the Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) is the opinion explaining the decision, while the Order (Document 36) is the actual decree.\n\nWait, the documents listed are:\n- Docket\n- Memorandum Opinion\n- Complaint\n- Untitled Document\n\nThe Order (Document 36) is part of the Docket document, which is already fully visited. The Docket document entry 36 says: \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\"\n\nBut the actual text of the order isn't in the Docket document - the Docket is just a log of filings. The Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) is the opinion, and the Order (Document 36) would be a separate document, but it's not listed as a separate document in the catalog. The catalog shows only 4 documents: Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, and Untitled Document.\n\nSo where is the actual decree? The Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) says \"Signed by Judge Brendan Abell Hurson on 8/22/25\" but doesn't contain the decree terms. The actual decree terms would be in the Order document (Document 36), but it's not listed as a separate document - it's referenced in the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket document (which is fully visited) contains entry 36: \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay. Signed by Judge Brendan Abell Hurson on 8/22/25.\"\n\nBut the Docket is just a log - it doesn't contain the full text of the order. The actual order text would be in a separate document, but it's not in the catalog. The catalog shows only the 4 documents.\n\nI should check if the Memorandum Opinion contains the decree terms. Looking at the Memorandum Opinion text, I don't see the actual decree terms listed. The court says \"This memorandum opinion is offered to explain the Court's reasoning\" and then discusses the legal merits, but doesn't list the specific decree terms.\n\nThe key part I'm looking for is in the actual order document, but since it's not listed as a separate document in the catalog, I need to see if it's included in one of the existing documents.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) is the opinion, and the Order (Document 36) is the actual decree. But the catalog doesn't list Document 36 as a separate document. The Docket document lists Document 36 as an entry, but the Docket itself is just a log.\n\nGiven the current document catalog, the only document that might contain the decree terms is the Memorandum Opinion, but it's not there. The Memorandum Opinion is the court's reasoning, not the decree itself.\n\nI should check if the \"Order\" is actually included in the Memorandum Opinion. Looking at the text of the Memorandum Opinion, it ends with \"Signed by Judge Brendan Abell Hurson on 8/22/25.\" But it doesn't contain the actual decree terms.\n\nWait, in the Docket document, entry 36 is the Order, but the Docket is just a log. The actual text of the Order would be in a separate document, but it's not listed. The catalog shows \"Memorandum Opinion\" as Document 35 and \"Order\" as Document 36, but the catalog doesn't list Document 36 as a separate document to read.\n\nThe catalog shows:\n- Docket [Docket] - 4,335 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\n- Memorandum Opinion [Order/Opinion] - 47,265 tokens - ◐ Partially Visited\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint] - 14,907 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- Untitled Document [Unknown] - 948 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSo Document 36 (the Order) is not listed as a separate document. The Memorandum Opinion is Document 35, and the Order is Document 36, but Document 36 isn't in the catalog as a separate document. The catalog only has 4 documents, so Document 36 must be part of one of them.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion document (Document 35) is the opinion, and the Order (Document 36) might be included in the same document or in the Docket. But the Docket is a log, not the actual order.\n\nGiven the current state, the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (up to 20,000 tokens), and the text I've read so far doesn't contain the decree terms. The decree terms would be in the actual Order, which is probably in a different document, but it's not listed in the catalog.\n\nWait, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document (Document 35) might actually contain the Order. In legal documents, sometimes the opinion includes the order. Let me check the text again.\n\nIn the Memorandum Opinion, it says \"This memorandum opinion is offered to explain the Court's reasoning\" and then discusses the merits, but doesn't list the decree terms. The actual decree terms would be in the Order document, which is referenced in the Docket as Document 36.\n\nSince Document 36 isn't listed as a separate document in the catalog, I should look for it in the existing documents. The only document that might contain it is the Memorandum Opinion, but I haven't read the entire thing yet.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is 47,265 tokens, and I've read up to 20,000 tokens. So there's still 27,265 tokens to read. The decree terms are likely at the end of the opinion, where the court would state the order.\n\nI should read more of the Memorandum Opinion to find the decree terms. The next logical step is to read the next window of the Memorandum Opinion, from 20,000 to 30,000 tokens.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on Memorandum Opinion for tokens 20,000-30,000.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 20000, \"end_token\": 30000}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 20000, "end_token": 30000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 28635, "completion_tokens": 1867, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Wait, the user's Docket shows Document 35 as the Memorandum Opinion, and Document 36 as the Order. So the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document (Document 35) likely contains the opinion, and the Order is a separate document (Document 36), but the catalog lists only four documents: Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, Untitled. Wait, the \"Docket\" is a separate document (4335 tokens), \"Memorandum Opinion\" is another (47k tokens), and two others.\n\nWait, the document catalog says:\n\n- Docket [Docket] - 4335 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\n- Memorandum Opinion [Order/Opinion] - 47,265 tokens - ◐ Partially Visited (0-30000)\n- Complaint [Complaint] - 14,907 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- Untitled Document [Unknown] - 948 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSo \"Memorandum Opinion\" is Document 35, which is the opinion. The Order (Document 36) is probably part of another document or maybe it's included in the Memorandum Opinion. Wait, the Docket entry 35 is \"MEMORANDUM OPINION\" and 36 is \"ORDER GRANTING...\", so Document 35 is the opinion, and Document 36 is the order. But the catalog lists \"Memorandum Opinion\" as the document name, so perhaps the actual Order (Document 36) is not in the catalog, or maybe it's part of the Memorandum Opinion. Wait, the user's provided text for \"Memorandum Opinion\" (tokens 0-30000) includes the opinion, but the actual order might be in the next part of the same document. However, the token range given for the Memorandum Opinion is up to 30000, but the document is 47k tokens, so there's more to read.\n\nWait, the user's Step 5 says they read Memorandum Opinion tokens 20000-30000. So the document has 47k tokens, so reading up to 30k leaves 17k tokens unvisited. The Order (Document 36) might be the next part, but according to the catalog, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" is one document, so the Order is probably part of it. The Docket entry 36 is the order, but the document is still called \"Memorandum Opinion\" in the catalog.\n\nBut the key is to find the decree terms. The Memorandum Opinion (Document 35) explains the court's decision, but the actual decree terms would be in the Order (Document 36). However, since the catalog lists \"Memorandum Opinion\" as the document, perhaps the Order is included in the same document. The user's Step 5 read up to 30000 tokens, but the document is 47k, so the Order might be in the remaining tokens (30000-47265).\n\nSo the next step is to read the next token range of the Memorandum Opinion to get the Order. The current read was up to 30000, so the next range would be 30000-40000 (within 10k tokens).\n\nLooking at the provided text in Step 5 (tokens 20000-30000), it ends with \"the lack of in-circuit precedent\" and the document continues. The actual Order (Document 36) is likely in the latter part of the Memorandum Opinion document.\n\nThe user needs to read the next 10k tokens (30000-40000) to find the Order, which contains the specific decree terms. For example, the Order might state \"the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs' Motion and enters a STAY enjoining certain provisions of the Rule from taking effect on August 25, 2025.\"\n\nThe \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" should include the specific provisions that are stayed. From the Memorandum Opinion, the court found that Plaintiffs succeeded on seven provisions, so the decree would stay those seven provisions.\n\nIn the text provided (Step 5), the court mentions \"the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that there is a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the Rule.\" So the decree would stay those seven provisions.\n\nBut the actual terms need to be extracted from the Order (Document 36), which is part of the Memorandum Opinion document. Since the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited, the next step is to read the next token range to get the Order.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call `read_document` on \"Memorandum Opinion\" for tokens 30000-40000.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\",\n    \"start_token\": 30000,\n    \"end_token\": 40000\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 30000, "end_token": 40000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 39080, "completion_tokens": 1920, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, specifically the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The available documents are Docket (fully visited), Memorandum Opinion (partially visited, tokens 0-40000), and two unvisited documents: Complaint and Untitled Document.\n\nThe checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" is empty. The task is to extract all distinct values from the documents. The Memorandum Opinion has been partially read up to token 40000, but the user's last read was tokens 30000-40000. Wait, the snapshot says \"Memorandum Opinion\" is partially visited with tokens 0-40000 viewed (85% coverage). The last action was reading tokens 30000-40000. So the remaining tokens would be 40000-47265.\n\nBut the user needs to find the decree terms. The Memorandum Opinion is a court opinion that might contain the court's order. The Docket is already fully visited, so no need to read it again. The other two documents are unvisited. However, the Memorandum Opinion is the key document here because it's the court's opinion where the decree would be stated.\n\nLooking at the provided text snippets from the Memorandum Opinion, the court grants a stay and denies other parts. The relevant part for the decree terms would be in the order. The Docket entry 36 says \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\" So the order itself would have the terms.\n\nIn the Memorandum Opinion, the court states: \"This memorandum opinion is offered to explain the Court's reasoning.\" But the actual decree terms might be in the order, which is a separate document. Wait, the Docket entry 36 is the order. The Memorandum Opinion is the reasoning, but the order (Docket 36) would have the actual decree.\n\nBut the Docket is already fully visited. The Docket entry 36 says: \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay. Signed by Judge Brendan Abell Hurson on 8/22/25.\" However, the Docket entry doesn't contain the actual terms of the order, just the fact that it was granted. The actual order would be in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document or another document.\n\nWait, the document catalog lists \"Memorandum Opinion\" as a document. The Docket is a separate document. The Memorandum Opinion (tokens 0-40000) is part of the court's opinion, which might include the order. But the order is usually a separate document. However, in the Docket, entry 35 is \"MEMORANDUM OPINION\" and entry 36 is \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART...\". So the Memorandum Opinion (document 35) is the opinion, and the order (document 36) is separate. But the user's available documents don't list the order as a separate document; the \"Memorandum Opinion\" might include the order.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows \"Memorandum Opinion\" as a document with 47,265 tokens. The Docket is another document. The order (Docket 36) is part of the Docket, but the actual text of the order isn't in the Docket; the Docket just lists that an order was issued. The actual order text would be in another document, perhaps the \"Memorandum Opinion\" or a separate \"Order\" document. But the available documents are Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, and Untitled. The Memorandum Opinion is the main document here.\n\nLooking at the text provided in the Memorandum Opinion, the court says: \"the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs' Motion and enters a STAY enjoining certain provisions of the Rule from taking effect on August 25, 2025.\" So the decree terms would include the stay on certain provisions. But the user needs to extract the specific terms.\n\nThe key here is to find the exact terms ordered by the court. The court mentions \"seven provisions\" where they granted the stay. The specific terms would be the injunction on those provisions. The Memorandum Opinion lists which provisions were stayed. Let's look for the part where it says \"the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part... enjoining certain provisions.\"\n\nIn the text, the court states: \"The Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that there is a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the Rule. Plaintiffs have failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief on the remaining challenges to two other provisions of the Rule.\"\n\nSo the decree terms include the stay on seven provisions. But the specific terms would need to be listed. However, the user's task is to extract the substantive obligations ordered by the court. The decree here is a stay on certain provisions of the Rule.\n\nThe problem is that the Memorandum Opinion doesn't list the specific seven provisions by name. It refers to them as \"seven provisions\" but doesn't detail each one. The actual terms would be in the order document, which might not be fully covered yet.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion is up to token 40000, but the document is 47,265 tokens. So there's still 7,265 tokens left. The user should read the remaining tokens to see if the specific terms are listed.\n\nAlternatively, the Complaint might contain the terms, but the Complaint is unvisited. However, the Complaint is the initial filing, which would outline the claims, not the court's decree. The decree would be in the order, which is likely in the Memorandum Opinion or a separate order document.\n\nSince the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited, the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens of the Memorandum Opinion (40000-47265) to find the specific decree terms.\n\nThe user's last read was tokens 30000-40000, so the next read should be 40000-47265 (7265 tokens, which is under 10,000). So the correct action is to call `read_document` on Memorandum Opinion for tokens 40000-47265.\n\nThis is because the decree terms might be in the later part of the opinion, where the court states the specific order. The initial part of the opinion explains the reasoning, but the actual decree (the order) might be at the end.\n\nLooking at the provided text, the last part of the Memorandum Opinion (tokens 30000-40000) ends with discussing the income verification provisions. The actual order might be in the remaining tokens. So reading the remaining tokens is necessary.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 40000, \"end_token\": 47265}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 40000, "end_token": 47265}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 49513, "completion_tokens": 1620, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking for the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents. The checklist item requires extracting substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty except for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which is empty. The available documents are Docket (fully visited), Memorandum Opinion (fully visited), and two unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and an Untitled Document.\n\nThe Docket and Memorandum Opinion have already been fully read. The Docket is a list of court entries, and the Memorandum Opinion is the court's reasoning. The Memorandum Opinion mentions several provisions being challenged, but the actual decree terms might be in the ORDER document.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion ends with \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\" But the actual order text isn't in the excerpts provided. The user's Step 6 and 7 show the Memorandum Opinion, but the ORDER might be a separate document.\n\nThe available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" which was read fully, but there's also \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"Untitled Document\" that haven't been visited yet. The ORDER granting the stay would likely be in a separate document. Wait, the Docket entry 36 says \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion...\" so maybe the actual ORDER is in a document called \"Order\" or something. But looking at the available documents, the only ones are Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, and Untitled.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion is the court's opinion, but the ORDER might be a separate document. The user's Step 6 shows the Memorandum Opinion up to page 76, but the ORDER itself might be in a different document. However, the available documents list \"Memorandum Opinion\" as fully visited, but the ORDER might be part of that or in another document.\n\nWait, the user's Step 5 and 6 show that the Memorandum Opinion was read up to 47,265 tokens, which is the full document. But the ORDER (entry 36 in the Docket) is probably included in the Memorandum Opinion. However, the excerpts provided don't show the actual order terms. The Memorandum Opinion explains the court's reasoning but the actual decree terms might be in the ORDER document.\n\nWait, the Docket has an entry 36: \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay.\" So the actual ORDER document would be separate, but it's not listed in the available documents. The available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" which is the opinion, and the ORDER might be a separate file, but it's not listed here. The user's available documents are Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, and Untitled. The Docket is the log, not the actual order.\n\nWait, the user's \"Available Documents\" list shows \"Memorandum Opinion\" as the document type, but the ORDER might be included in that. However, the text provided in Step 5 and 6 is the Memorandum Opinion, which is the court's reasoning, not the order. The actual order would have the specific terms. But the user's Step 5 and 6 don't include the ORDER text. The last part of the Memorandum Opinion says \"Dated: August 22, 2025\" and the judge's signature, but the actual order terms are probably in a separate document.\n\nWait, the user's Step 4-7 show that they read the Memorandum Opinion, but the ORDER is a different document. The available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"Untitled Document\" which are unvisited. Maybe the ORDER is in one of those. But the Complaint is the plaintiff's filing, not the court's order.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which are the court's ordered terms. The court's order would be in the \"ORDER\" document. But the available documents don't have an \"ORDER\" document. The Memorandum Opinion is the opinion, and the ORDER might be a separate document. However, in the Docket, entry 36 is the ORDER, so maybe the actual ORDER text is in a document called \"Order\" but it's listed as \"Untitled Document\" or something else.\n\nWait, the available documents are:\n\n- Docket [Docket] - fully visited\n- Memorandum Opinion [Order/Opinion] - fully visited\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [Complaint] - unvisited\n- Untitled Document [Unknown] - unvisited\n\nThe \"Memorandum Opinion\" is labeled as [Order/Opinion], so maybe the actual ORDER is part of that document. But the excerpts provided don't show the ORDER text. The Memorandum Opinion ends with the judge's signature, but the actual ORDER might be a separate section. Wait, in the Docket, entry 36 is \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART...\", so the ORDER document would have the text of the order. The Memorandum Opinion is the court's reasoning, and the ORDER is the actual order. So the ORDER might be in the \"Untitled Document\" or \"Complaint\" but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 shows that they read the Docket (tokens 0-4335), which lists the Docket entries, including entry 36 as the ORDER. But the Docket is just a log of filings, not the actual document. The actual ORDER document would be a separate file. Since the available documents include \"Untitled Document\", maybe that's the ORDER.\n\nSo, the next step is to read the \"Untitled Document\" because it's unvisited and likely contains the ORDER text with the decree terms. The \"Complaint\" is probably the plaintiff's filing, which wouldn't have the court's decree terms.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call `read_document` on \"Untitled Document\" to get the actual order text.

The user wants me to extract all distinct values for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents provided. The checklist item definition specifies that this includes substantive obligations ordered by the court, such as consent decrees or stipulated judgments, but only if they're expressly incorporated into the court order. I need to find all unique terms from the documents.\n\nFirst, I'll review the documents that have been read so far. The Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and Untitled Document are all fully visited. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is unvisited, but since the task is to extract from the documents, I should check if the unvisited document might contain relevant terms. However, the Memorandum Opinion and Untitled Document (which is an Order) likely contain the court's decrees.\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Opinion (Step 5-7), the court discusses various provisions of the Rule that were challenged. The key part is in the Order (Step 8), where the court lists the specific provisions stayed. The Order (Document 38) explicitly states the provisions that are stayed, which are the court-ordered decrees. \n\nThe Order lists seven provisions (a-g) that are stayed. Each of these represents a substantive obligation ordered by the court. For example:\n- a. The imposition of a $5 premium penalty\n- b. Revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for past-due premiums\n- c. Failure to reconcile policy\n- d. Eligibility verification for SEP\n- e. Requirement to verify household income inconsistencies\n- f. Changes to de minimis ranges for actuarial value\n- g. Changes to self-attestation of projected income\n\nThese are the specific terms the court ordered to be stayed. Each of these is a distinct term that should be extracted. The Complaint might have more details, but since the Order explicitly lists the decrees, and the Memorandum Opinion discusses the legal basis, the Order is the primary source for the court's decrees.\n\nThe user mentioned \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" and the Order provides the exact terms the court is staying. So the values to extract are the seven provisions listed in the Order. Each needs to be a separate entry with evidence from the Order document.\n\nI need to confirm if the Order is the document where these terms are stated. The Untitled Document (Document 38) is the Order, and it's fully visited. The relevant text is in the Order, specifically the list under point 2. \n\nSo, the next step is to extract these seven terms as separate values. The evidence for each would be the specific provision listed in the Order. For example, for term \"a\", the evidence is the text \"The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.330(j);\"\n\nI should use `append_checklist` to add each of these terms as separate entries. The checklist key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and each term is a distinct value. Each entry needs evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nThe source document for all these terms is \"Untitled Document\" (Document 38), and the location is the specific bullet point (e.g., \"Section 2a\" or the exact text line).\n\nWait, the document name is \"Untitled Document\" but it's the Order. The evidence location should be the page number and section. In the Order, it's on Page 1-2, specifically the list under point 2.\n\nSo, for each of the seven terms, I'll create an entry with:\n- value: the term (e.g., \"The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees\")\n- evidence: text from the document, source document name, location (e.g., \"Page 1-2, Section 2a\")\n\nI need to make sure each is a separate entry. The Order lists them as a-g, so seven distinct terms.\n\nNow, checking if all are present in the visited documents. The Order is fully visited, so the text is available. The Memorandum Opinion discusses the legal reasoning but the actual decree terms are in the Order. So the Untitled Document (Order) is the correct source.\n\nNo need to read more documents since all relevant text is in the visited Order. The Complaint is unvisited, but it's a complaint, not the court's decree, so it's less likely to contain the specific terms ordered by the court. The Order is the final document with the court's decree.\n\nSo, the next action is to append each of the seven terms to the checklist under \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". Since the checklist is empty, and I have the values from the Order, I should use `append_checklist` with all seven entries.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So each term should have its own evidence.\n\nAlso, the evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be \"Page 1-2, Section 2a\" for each.\n\nNow, to structure the `append_checklist` call. The patch should have the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" with an array of extracted entries, each with evidence (text, source, location) and value.\n\nI'll need to list all seven terms. Let me list them from the Order:\n\na. The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.330(j)\nb. The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 147.104(i)\nc. The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule’s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(iii)\nd. The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.420(g)\ne. The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer’s attested projected annual household income differs from “trusted data sources,” through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2)\nf. The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. §§ 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400\ng. The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5)\n\nEach of these is a distinct term. For evidence, the text would be the exact phrase from the Order. Source document is \"Untitled Document\" (since that's the name of the document in the catalog). Location is \"Page 1-2, Section 2a\" etc.\n\nWait, the document name in the catalog is \"Untitled Document [Unknown]\", so source_document should be \"Untitled Document\".\n\nLocation for each: since the Order is on pages 1-2, and the list is under section 2, the location can be \"Page 1-2, Section 2 (provisions a-g)\".\n\nBut to be precise, for each entry, the location would be the specific bullet point. However, the exact page numbers in the document are given as \"Page 1 of 2\" and \"Page 2 of 2\", so the text for a is on Page 1, and b-g on Page 2? Wait, looking at the document:\n\nCase 1:25-cv-02114-BAH Document 38 Filed 08/25/25 Page 1 of 2\n...\n2. The effective dates of the following provisions ... are STAYED ...:\n   a. ... \n   b. ...\n   c. ...\n   d. ...\n   e. ...\n   f. ...\n   g. ...\n\nSo all are on Page 1 of the document, since Page 2 starts with \"SO ORDERED.\"\n\nWait, the document shows:\nPage 1 of 2: has the Order text including the list under 2.\nPage 2 of 2: has \"SO ORDERED.\" and signature.\n\nSo the list from a to g is on Page 1.\n\nThus, location for all is \"Page 1, Section 2 (provisions a-g)\".\n\nBut to be precise, the exact location can be \"Page 1, Section 2\" since the text is in that section.\n\nNow, for the evidence text, it's the exact phrase from the document.

The user is asking me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents, and I've already done several steps. The current status shows that I've successfully appended 7 values for this checklist item from the Untitled Document. The documents listed are Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Untitled Document, and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, the Complaint is marked as \"○ Unvisited\" (unvisited), meaning I haven't read it yet. But the user's task is to extract decree terms, and the checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". The previous steps show that the Untitled Document (which appears to be the court's order) already provided all 7 terms listed in the append_checklist step. \n\nWait, but the instructions say to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" from any document. The Memorandum Opinion and Docket were fully read in prior steps, and the Untitled Document was just read in Step 8. The Complaint is the only unvisited document. However, the Complaint is a legal filing by plaintiffs, not a court order or decree. The decree terms would be in the court's order (the Untitled Document), not in the Complaint. \n\nThe key point: the Checklist Item definition says \"substantive obligations ordered by the court\" – meaning the court's decree, not the parties' arguments. The Untitled Document is the court's order that lists the stayed provisions (which are the decree terms), so all 7 values are already extracted from that. \n\nThe Memorandum Opinion (the judge's reasoning) doesn't contain new decree terms – it's the analysis leading to the order. The Docket is just a case log. The Complaint is the plaintiffs' request, not the decree. \n\nTherefore, no new values should be found in the unvisited Complaint. The checklist item is fully covered with the 7 values already appended. \n\nI should verify with `get_checklist` to confirm, but the instructions say to stop when all keys are complete. Since there's only one key (\"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\") and it has 7 values with evidence, and the other documents aren't likely to contain new decree terms (as they're not the court's order), I should stop here. \n\nWait – the \"Current Status\" says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 7\", so all values are extracted.

The Memorandum Opinion and Docket have already been fully read (100% coverage), and the Untitled Document (court order) was fully read in step 8.\n\nThe system's automatic review confirms \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" has 7 values (all extracted), and no other checklist items exist.
