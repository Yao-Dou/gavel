The user is trying to extract related cases from legal documents, but the current status shows no documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is empty, and there are zero documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next move is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the legal documents. The checklist item requires every distinct value found in any document, each with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows all documents are unvisited. The available documents are Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and Untitled Document. Since none have been read yet, the next step should be to read a document. But which one?\n\nThe Docket document is the smallest (4,335 tokens), so maybe it's a good starting point because it's shorter and might contain case references. Dockets often list related cases. The Complaint might have references too, but Docket seems more likely to have case numbers.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" Dockets usually list related cases under \"Related Cases\" or similar sections. So searching the Docket first makes sense. But the instructions say to use read_document for targeted windows. However, since the Docket is unvisited, I should read it entirely or a part. But the Docket is only 4k tokens, so reading the whole thing is possible within 10k tokens.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Docket as 4,335 tokens. So reading the entire document in one go is allowed. So the next action should be read_document for the Docket, starting at 0 and ending at 4335.\n\nBut the user's previous step was list_documents, which found 4 documents. Now, since all are unvisited, the next logical step is to read one. The Docket is the smallest, so it's efficient to start there. If the Docket has the related cases, that's where the info is. If not, move to the next document.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on the Docket document with start_token 0 and end_token 4335. That way, we get the full content of the Docket to check for case codes.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4335}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4335}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3225, "completion_tokens": 463, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that none of the checklist items have values yet, and the Docket document has been fully read (tokens 0-4335), but the other documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should check the Docket document again to see if there are any related cases mentioned. The Docket entries listed in the recent actions include case numbers like \"1\" to \"38\", but those are docket entries, not case codes. The checklist item asks for related matters identified by their case numbers/codes. The Docket document doesn't seem to list other case numbers; it's just the docket entries for this case.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited and no related cases were found there, the next step is to check the other documents. The available documents are Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, and Untitled Document. The Complaint might have references to related cases. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) might also mention related cases, especially since it's an order from the judge.\n\nThe user needs to extract distinct values of related cases by their case codes. The Docket didn't have any, so I should read the Complaint document next. The Complaint is 14,907 tokens, which is under 10,000? Wait, no, 14,907 is more than 10,000. Wait, the maximum for read_document is 10,000 tokens. So I can't read the entire Complaint in one go. But the document is unvisited, so I need to read a portion of it. The best approach is to read the first 10,000 tokens (0-10,000) to check for any case codes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for patterns like \"Case No.\" or \"related case\" followed by numbers. But the checklist specifies \"case code number,\" so maybe looking for something like \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01234\" or similar. However, the user's example in the requirements mentions \"case numbers/codes,\" so maybe they're looking for specific case identifiers.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that the Docket was read, but the other documents haven't been. Since the Docket didn't have related cases, the next logical step is to read the Complaint document. The Complaint is the main document, so it might have references to other cases. Let me check the document names: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" — this is likely the main complaint, which might mention related cases in the text.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Complaint, starting from 0 to 10,000 tokens. That's within the limit. The other documents (Memorandum Opinion and Untitled) can be checked later if needed, but the Complaint is the most probable place to find related case numbers.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The Complaint might list other cases as part of the legal references, like \"See also Case No. 2:24-cv-5678\". So reading the Complaint's first 10k tokens makes sense.\n\nSince the Docket was fully read and no related cases found, proceed to read the Complaint. The current state says the Complaint is unvisited, so read_document is the right choice here.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7699, "completion_tokens": 799, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

I need to extract the related cases listed by their case code numbers. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". So, I have to look through the documents for any case numbers.\n\nFirst, check the available documents. The Docket document was fully read (tokens 0-4335), and the Complaint was partially read (0-10000). The other two documents, Memorandum Opinion and Untitled, are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the Docket, which was fully read, I need to scan for case numbers. The Docket entries have entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-02114-BAH\" in the Complaint document. Wait, the Docket is a list of filings, but the case number might be mentioned there. Let me check the Docket text provided.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 1 says: \"COMPLAINT against CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR, MEHMET OZ ( Filing fee $ 405 receipt number AMDDC-12075996.), filed by CITY OF CHICAGO, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, CITY OF COLUMBUS, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE. (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Summons, ...)(McElvain, Joel) (Entered: 07/01/2025)\"\n\nWait, but the case number in the Complaint document is mentioned as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-2114\" on page 3. So the case code number is 1:25-cv-2114. But the checklist asks for related cases, so maybe there are other case numbers mentioned in the documents.\n\nWait, the Docket might have other case numbers. Let me check the Docket entries again. The Docket entries are numbered 1 to 38, but they don't mention other case numbers. For example, entry 12 says \"PAPERLESS ORDER confirming the briefing schedule re 11 MOTION...\" which refers to Motion 11, not a case number. The Complaint document's case number is 1:25-cv-02114-BAH, but that's the current case. The task is to find related cases listed by their case codes.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". So, are there any other case numbers mentioned in the documents that are related to this case? For example, maybe in the Complaint or other documents, there's a reference to another case.\n\nLooking at the Complaint document, the case number is 1:25-cv-02114-BAH. The document starts with \"Case 1:25-cv-02114-BAH     Document 1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 1 of 30\". But the checklist is about related cases, so maybe the Complaint references another case. Let me check the text.\n\nIn the Complaint, on page 3, it says \"Case No. 1:25-cv-2114\". Wait, that's the same as the document's case number. But maybe there's a reference to another case. Let me look through the Complaint for other case numbers.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text, I see references to other legal cases. For example, in footnote 1: \"Excerpts From The Times’s Interview with Trump, N.Y. Times (July 19, 2017), https://perma.cc/XT6Q-LSPA.\" That's a citation, not a case number. Then on page 5, footnote 2: \"See City Code and Charter, City of Columbus (May 28, 2025), https://perma.cc/B9VK-D6JH; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 715.01 (West 1953).\" Not a case number.\n\nWait, maybe in the Docket entries. Let's check the Docket again. Entry 36: \"ORDER GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART 11 Motion for a Stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, for a Preliminary Injunction, construed as a Motion for a Stay. Signed by Judge Brendan Abell Hurson on 8/22/2025. (hmls, Deputy Clerk) (Entered: 08/22/2025)\".\n\nWait, entry 11 refers to a Motion, but not a case number. The case number for this case is 1:25-cv-02114. Are there other case numbers mentioned? Let me check the Complaint again.\n\nWait, the Complaint's title is \"COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and it's Case No. 1:25-cv-2114. The Docket shows that the case is filed in the District of Maryland, and the case number is consistent.\n\nBut the task is to extract related cases. Maybe the related cases are listed elsewhere. Wait, in the Docket, entry 40 mentions \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763.\" Wait, that's a case citation. F. Supp. 3d refers to Federal Supplement, Third Series. So 523 F. Supp. 3d 763 is a case. Let me check that.\n\nEntry 40: \"In 2017, CMS adopted a policy requiring the Exchanges to audit all enrollees who project that their household income for the upcoming year will be greater than 100% of the federal poverty level, if the IRS reports data indicating that the enrollee’s current income is below that threshold. Because this policy created 'immense administrative burdens' for low-income enrollees, this Court held that it 'defie[d] logic' and vacated it as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763.\"\n\nSo \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" is a case citation. The case number here is 523 F. Supp. 3d 763. But the checklist asks for case code numbers. F. Supp. 3d is the reporter, so the case is City of Columbus v. CMS, and the citation is 523 F. Supp. 3d 763. However, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which probably refers to the case number like \"1:25-cv-02114\" or similar. But the citation here is a court case citation, not a case code number. However, the user's instruction says \"case numbers/codes\", so maybe the citation is considered a related case.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So the case code here would be the federal case number, like 523 F. Supp. 3d 763. But that's a citation, not a case code. Wait, maybe the case code in the court system for that case is different. However, in the document, it's cited as \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", so the related case is City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763. But the checklist item wants the case code number, which might be the docket number of that case. However, the current document doesn't provide that; it just cites the case. So perhaps the related case is identified by its citation, and the case code number is the citation itself.\n\nWait, but the user's example in the Recent Actions shows that the case code is like \"1:25-cv-02114\", which is the docket number. So the related cases should be other docket numbers mentioned in the documents.\n\nWait, let's check the Docket again. The Docket is for this case (1:25-cv-02114), so other entries in the Docket are filings for this case, not related cases. The Complaint document refers to the City of Columbus case (523 F. Supp. 3d 763), which is a different case. So that's a related case. But the case code for that would be the docket number of that case, but the document doesn't provide it; it just cites the case. So the related case is listed as \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", so the case code number here might be \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" or the case name. But the checklist item says \"case numbers/codes\", so probably the citation is the identifier.\n\nBut the user's requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the document mentions \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", that's a related case, and the case code number is \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\". However, the example in the problem statement (Complaint) has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-2114\", which is a docket number. So maybe the related case's case code is the docket number, but the document doesn't provide it. The document refers to the case by its citation.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item says \"case numbers/codes\", so perhaps the citation is considered the case code here. Let's see. The Complaint references \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" as a prior case. So the related case is that case, and its case code is 523 F. Supp. 3d 763.\n\nBut I need to confirm if there are other references. Let's check the Complaint again. On page 5, footnote 2: \"See City Code and Charter, City of Columbus (May 28, 2025), https://perma.cc/B9VK-D6JH; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 715.01 (West 1953).\" That's a statute, not a case.\n\nAnother reference: \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\" Wait, in the Complaint, on page 5, it says \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\" So that's another citation. So this case, \"City of Columbus v. Cochran\", has a case number of 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, but the docket number would be something like 1:21-cv-00001 or similar. However, the document doesn't provide the docket number; it provides the citation.\n\nBut the checklist item says \"case numbers/codes\", so perhaps the citation is considered the code here. The problem statement's example uses \"Case No. 1:25-cv-2114\", which is the docket number, but in the Complaint, the case code mentioned is \"1:25-cv-2114\", and the related case is cited as \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\".\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract the related cases listed by their case codes. So in the document, if a related case is mentioned with its case code (like \"Case No. 1:21-cv-00001\"), then that's the value. But in the Complaint, it's cited as \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", which is the citation, not the docket number. However, the checklist item says \"case numbers/codes\", so maybe the citation is acceptable as the case code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the related case is listed elsewhere. Let's check the Docket again. The Docket entries are all for the current case (1:25-cv-02114), so no other case numbers there.\n\nThe Complaint document mentions \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" on page 4 (in the text: \"this Court responded to those efforts, vacating and remanding portions of the rule as arbitrary and capricious.\") and also \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021)\" on page 5. So those are two related cases.\n\nWait, the problem is that the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The case codes here would be the docket numbers, but the document uses citations. However, the user's example shows that the case code is the docket number (1:25-cv-2114), so perhaps the related case's code is the citation. But the user might consider the citation as the case code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the related case's code is the citation, so the value would be \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let's look at the exact text in the Complaint.\n\nFrom the Complaint:\n\n\"During the first Trump presidency, the Administration vowed to 'watch Obamacare go down the tubes.'1 Previously, in a 2019 rule, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (Apr. 17, 2018), CMS and HHS attempted to contravene the ACA with proposals that would have eliminated many of the ACA’s guarantees, deterred consumers from enrolling in quality health insurance plans, and increased out-of-pocket costs, similar to the 2025 Rule. This Court responded to those efforts, vacating and remanding portions of the rule as arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThen, footnote 1: \"Excerpts From The Times’s Interview with Trump, N.Y. Times (July 19, 2017), https://perma.cc/XT6Q-LSPA.\"\n\nThen, on page 5: \"In 2017, CMS adopted a policy requiring the Exchanges to audit all enrollees who project that their household income for the upcoming year will be greater than 100% of the federal poverty level, if the IRS reports data indicating that the enrollee’s current income is below that threshold. Because this policy created 'immense administrative burdens' for low-income enrollees, this Court held that it 'defie[d] logic' and vacated it as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763.\"\n\nSo \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" is the citation for the case. The case code number here is \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", which is the citation.\n\nAnother reference: \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\" So that's another case.\n\nSo the related cases listed are \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nBut the checklist item is to extract the case code numbers. So the values would be \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\". Wait, but the full citation includes the court and year. However, the user's example uses \"1:25-cv-2114\", which is the docket number. The related cases' docket numbers aren't provided, so the citation might be the best we have.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"case numbers/codes\", so perhaps the citation is considered the case code here. So the extracted values should be the citations as they appear in the document.\n\nSo, the related cases listed are:\n\n1. 523 F. Supp. 3d 763 (from the text \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\")\n2. 523 F. Supp. 3d 731 (from \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731\")\n\nWait, but the second one is \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731\", so the case code would be \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nNow, I need to make sure these are the only ones. Let's check the Complaint for any other references.\n\nLooking through the Complaint, I don't see other case citations. The Docket doesn't mention other case numbers. So these two are the related cases listed.\n\nNow, the next step is to extract these values with evidence. The evidence should be the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nFor the first one: \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" is on page 4 (as per the text), but in the provided text, it's on page 4 of the Complaint. Wait, in the Complaint text provided, the line is:\n\n\"In 2017, CMS adopted a policy requiring the Exchanges to audit all enrollees who project that their household income for the upcoming year will be greater than 100% of the federal poverty level, if the IRS reports data indicating that the enrollee’s current income is below that threshold. Because this policy created 'immense administrative burdens' for low-income enrollees, this Court held that it 'defie[d] logic' and vacated it as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763.\"\n\nThis is in the Complaint document, page 4 (as per the page numbers in the document). The location would be \"page 4\" or \"page 4 of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSimilarly, the other citation is on page 5:\n\n\"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\"\n\nSo the values are \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nWait, but the checklist item says \"case numbers/codes\", so the value should be the case code. However, the document lists the cases with their citations. So the extracted value would be the citation part. For example, \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nBut I need to confirm if these are considered case codes. Since the user's example uses \"1:25-cv-2114\" as the case code, which is the docket number, but here the document uses citations, perhaps the user expects the citation as the case code for related cases. So I'll proceed with those.\n\nNow, the current state shows that the checklist item is empty. So I need to append these values.\n\nBut the user's recent actions have already read the Complaint up to token 10000, which includes these references. So I should use append_checklist to add these two entries.\n\nWait, the Complaint was read from tokens 0-10000, and the relevant text is within that range. So I can extract the values now.\n\nSo the action is to append the checklist entries for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number with the two values.\n\nEach entry needs evidence: text, source_document, location.\n\nFirst value: \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" with evidence:\n\ntext: \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\"\n\nsource_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n\nlocation: \"page 4\"\n\nSecond value: \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\" with evidence:\n\ntext: \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\"\n\nsource_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n\nlocation: \"page 5\"\n\nWait, the second one's text is \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021).\", so the case code part is \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nSo the value to extract is \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nSimilarly, the first one's value is \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\".\n\nSo the extracted values are those two strings.\n\nNow, check if there are any other related cases. I don't see any others in the documents provided.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the values are the case codes. So the extracted list should have [\"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\", \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\"].\n\nBut I need to make sure these are the correct case codes. Since the document lists them as part of the citation, that's the best we have.\n\nSo the correct action is to append these two values to the checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"523 F.

The task is to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and so far we've extracted two values from the Complaint document: \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are more related cases in the remaining documents. The current status shows:\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: partially visited (67% coverage, tokens 0-10000)\n- Docket: fully visited (100% coverage)\n- Memorandum Opinion: unvisited (47,265 tokens)\n- Untitled Document: unvisited (948 tokens)\n\nThe Docket has already been fully read (tokens 0-4335), and the Complaint has 33% of its content left (10000-14907 tokens). Since the checklist item is about case code numbers, which are often cited in legal documents, I should check the remaining parts of the Complaint first because that's where the previous entries came from.\n\nThe next logical step is to read the remaining tokens in the Complaint document (from 10000 to 14907) to see if there are more case code numbers. The document is 14,907 tokens total, and we've read up to 10,000. So I'll call read_document for the Complaint with start_token=10000 and end_token=14907.\n\nWait, but the maximum token range per call is 10,000 tokens. The remaining tokens are 14907 - 10000 = 4907 tokens, which is under 10,000, so it's safe to read the entire remaining portion in one go.\n\nI should check if any other documents might contain related case numbers. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is a 47k token document, which is large, but since the previous entries came from the Complaint, it's more efficient to first finish reading the Complaint before moving to other documents. The Untitled Document is small (948 tokens), but it's unknown what it contains, so it's better to prioritize the Complaint first.\n\nAfter reading the remaining tokens of the Complaint, I'll analyze the text to see if there are additional case code numbers. If found, I'll use append_checklist to add them. If not, then I'll proceed to check the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Complaint for the remaining tokens (10000-14907).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 14907}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 14907}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18481, "completion_tokens": 662, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. So far, they've already read the Docket and the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. From the Complaint, they found two entries: \"523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"523 F. Supp. 3d 731\". \n\nNow, the current status shows that all keys (only one key here) have values, with two extracted values. The documents available are Complaint (fully visited), Docket (fully visited), Memorandum Opinion (unvisited), and an Untitled Document (unvisited). \n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the extracted values are case references. The user found two values in the Complaint. But maybe there are more in the other documents. The Memorandum Opinion and Untitled Document haven't been read yet. However, the previous steps show that Step 5 was reading the Complaint again (tokens 10000-14907), but it's already fully visited. The other two documents (Memorandum Opinion and Untitled) are unvisited.\n\nBut the task is to extract all distinct values. So I need to check if the Memorandum Opinion or the Untitled Document have any case codes. The Memorandum Opinion is a court order, so it might cite other cases. The Untitled Document might be a related document.\n\nWait, the Recent Actions show that the user has already done list_documents, read the Docket, read the Complaint, appended the checklist, and read more of the Complaint. Now, the next step is to check if there are more documents to read. The available documents include Memorandum Opinion and Untitled, which are unvisited. So maybe I should read those to see if they have any related cases.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The values extracted so far are from the Complaint, which references \"City of Columbus, 523 F. Supp. 3d 763\" and \"City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731, 740 (D. Md. 2021)\". These are case references, so they're valid.\n\nNow, the question is: do the other documents contain more case codes? The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) might cite other cases. The Untitled Document might be a related case. So the next action should be to read those unvisited documents.\n\nBut the user's next action should be one of the options. The available actions are to read_document, search_document_regex, etc. Since the Memorandum Opinion is a large document (47,265 tokens), it's better to read a portion of it. But the user can only read up to 10,000 tokens per call. So maybe start with reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Documents in Corpus: 4\", and the available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" as unvisited. So the next logical step is to read that document. The user should call read_document on Memorandum Opinion for tokens 0-10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for case codes like \"F. Supp. 3d\" or similar patterns. But since the checklist is specifically about case code numbers, maybe searching for patterns like \"F. Supp. 3d\" or \"D. Md.\" would help find more references. However, the user has already extracted two values from the Complaint, and the task is to find all. But the user might need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the user's current checklist has 2 values, but maybe there are more. The Memorandum Opinion is the next document to check. So the correct action is to read_document on Memorandum Opinion (tokens 0-10000) to see if it contains more case references.\n\nWait, the previous steps show that after reading the Complaint (which was fully visited), the next step is to check the other unvisited documents. So the next action should be to read the Memorandum Opinion document, starting from token 0.\n\nSo the tool call should be read_document with doc_name \"Memorandum Opinion\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 23724, "completion_tokens": 996, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The status shows that these two values are already appended to the checklist.\n\nLooking at the current status, the keys with values are 1 out of 1, empty keys are 0, and Not Applicable is 0. So all checklist items have been filled.
