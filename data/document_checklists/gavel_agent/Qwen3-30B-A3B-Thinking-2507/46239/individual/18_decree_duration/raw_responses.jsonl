The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the next step should be. The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information. But right now, the immediate action is to call `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3150, "completion_tokens": 253, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value found.\n\nFirst, I need to check which documents are available. The current status shows 5 unvisited documents: Complaint, Docket, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Defendants’ Opposition, and Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nSince the task is about decree duration, which is likely in court orders or judgments, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the Defendants’ Opposition might contain relevant info. But the Docket could also list court orders. However, the Complaint is probably the initial filing, which might not have the decree yet. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal probably means the case was dismissed, so no decree.\n\nThe next step is to decide which document to read first. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (8,976 tokens) is a good candidate because it's a motion that might discuss the terms of a potential decree. The Defendants’ Opposition (16,947 tokens) is longer but might have arguments against the decree, so maybe the Motion is more likely to have the decree details.\n\nWait, but the user specified \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". The Motion for Preliminary Injunction is a motion asking the court to issue an injunction, so the court's order granting it would have the duration. But the Motion itself might not contain the court's order; it's the pleading before the court decides. The actual decree would be in the court's order, which might be in the Docket or another document.\n\nThe Docket (1,054 tokens) is a log of court entries. The Docket might list the court's orders, including the duration of any decrees. So maybe the Docket is the best place to start.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is small (1,054 tokens), so reading it entirely is feasible. The Docket might have entries like \"Order Granting Preliminary Injunction\" with a duration specified.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, use read_document for the entire document. The token count is 1,054, so start_token 0, end_token 1054.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so read the whole thing. The parameters would be doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 1054.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"decree\" or \"injunction\" duration. But since the document is small, reading it directly is efficient. The Docket is likely to have the court's order entries, so reading it makes sense.\n\nYes, the Docket is the most probable place to find the decree duration. So the correct action is read_document on the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1054}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1054}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3324, "completion_tokens": 654, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" from the legal documents. So far, they've read the Docket, which is fully visited, and didn't find anything related to decree duration. The Docket has entries like motions, orders, dismissals, but nothing about the duration of a decree.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is done. The next step is to check the other documents. The Checklist item is about the duration of court-ordered decrees, like injunctions or consent decrees. The Docket mentions a MINUTE ORDER on March 25th that orders Defendants to file opposition by April 4, and a hearing on April 25. But that's about deadlines for motions, not the duration of a decree. Then on April 14th, there's a dismissal without prejudice. So the case was dismissed, meaning no decree was entered. Wait, the dismissal without prejudice might mean there's no decree, so maybe \"Not Applicable\" for that key.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if there's any decree. The Docket shows a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (entry 5), but the MINUTE ORDER (entry 6) only sets deadlines and a hearing date. Then the opposition (entry 7) and the dismissal (entries 14 and 8). The dismissal says \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE,\" which means the court didn't issue a decree or judgment. So there's no decree duration to extract. Therefore, the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut before setting it to Not Applicable, I need to check if any other documents might have the decree. The other documents are Complaint, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Defendants’ Opposition, and Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (entry 5) mentions a \"Text of Proposed Order\" as an attachment. That proposed order might include the duration. So the Motion document (8,976 tokens) is unvisited and likely contains the proposed decree terms.\n\nWait, the Motion document is called \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum...\" and it has a proposed order. So the duration might be in there. The Docket entry 5 says \"Text of Proposed Order\" is attached. So reading that document would be the next step. But the Docket itself doesn't have the decree duration, so the next logical step is to read the Motion document to check for the proposed order.\n\nThe available documents include \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction...\" which is unvisited. So the next action should be to read that document. Since it's a large document (8,976 tokens), but the max per read is 10k tokens, so reading the whole thing is possible. But maybe they can read the entire document since it's under 10k.\n\nWait, the Motion document is 8,976 tokens, which is under 10k, so read_document on that whole document. But the user needs to choose one action. So the correct action here is to read the Motion document to check for the proposed order which might contain the decree duration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"duration\" or \"decree\" in that document. But the problem says to use read_document as default. Since the Motion document is the most likely to contain the proposed order, reading it would be better.\n\nSo the next step is to call read_document on \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" with start_token 0 and end_token 8976 (the whole document).\n\nWait, the document's token count is 8,976, so start 0, end 8976. That's within the 10k limit. So that's the correct action.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8976}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8976}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4466, "completion_tokens": 891, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of court-ordered decrees like injunctions or consent decrees.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The system says all keys are empty, and they've already read the Docket and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Docket was fully visited (100% coverage), and the Motion document was also fully read (100% coverage). The other documents are unvisited, but maybe they don't contain the decree duration.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, the case was dismissed without prejudice on April 14, 2025. The dismissal order says \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" There's no mention of a decree or injunction duration here. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed, but the court didn't grant the injunction yet. The minute order from March 25, 2025, only sets deadlines for opposition and hearing, not a decree. The dismissal on April 14 ended the case without a decree being issued.\n\nWait, the Motion document (page 13-16) discusses the requested injunction, but the court hasn't granted it yet. The plaintiff is asking for a preliminary injunction, but the order from the Docket shows the case was dismissed before the injunction could be finalized. So there's no court-ordered decree here. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled, but no decree was issued.\n\nThe user needs to check if any document mentions a decree duration. Since the case was dismissed without prejudice, there's no decree. But according to the Not Applicable encoding rules, they need explicit evidence. The dismissal order states \"DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE,\" which implies no decree was entered. However, the checklist requires court-ordered decrees like injunctions. Since the injunction wasn't granted (the case was dismissed before the hearing), there's no decree to have a duration.\n\nSo, for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last,\" there are no applicable values. The correct action is to set this to \"Not Applicable\" via update_checklist with evidence from the dismissal order. The evidence would be the text from the Docket: \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\"\n\nWait, but the user has already read both documents. The Motion document was fully read, and the Docket was fully read. The dismissal happened, so no decree was issued. Therefore, the item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nThe current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so they need to set it to Not Applicable. The next action should be update_checklist with the value \"Not Applicable\" and the evidence from the Docket entry about dismissal without prejudice.\n\nI should check if any other documents might have a decree. The Complaint, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Defendants' Opposition are unvisited, but the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (from April 14) says the case was dismissed, so it's the same as the Docket entry. The Complaint probably doesn't have a decree since it's the initial filing. The Defendants' Opposition would be about the motion, but since the case was dismissed, there's no decree there either.\n\nSo, the only evidence needed is from the dismissal order.

The Docket entry states: \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" \n\nThe key point here is that the case was dismissed without prejudice, which means there was no final judgment or decree issued.
