Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is definitely unknown. So the first step is to get the list of documents.\n\nThe tools provided include list_documents, which is supposed to return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the correct action here is to call list_documents.\n\nI need to make sure I'm following the instructions. The snapshot says \"If the document catalog is unknown → call list_documents.\" Since there are no documents discovered, the catalog is unknown. So the next action must be list_documents. I shouldn't try to read or search anything else because there's nothing to read from.\n\nNo other actions make sense here. The user hasn't provided any documents, so I can't use read_document or search_document_regex. Get_checklist would just return empty results, and append/update aren't applicable yet.

The user has a task to extract four specific items from legal documents. They've already listed the documents, and all are unvisited. The first step is to figure out which document to start with.\n\nLooking at the checklist items, Filing_Date is the date the lawsuit was filed. That's usually in the Complaint or the Docket. The Complaint is the first document filed, so it's a good starting point. The Docket might have the filing date too, but the Complaint is more likely to have it as part of the case initiation.\n\nThe other items: Who_are_the_Parties would be in the Complaint as well, since parties are listed there. Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs and Type_of_Counsel might also be in the Complaint or other pleadings. But the Complaint is the primary document for the case's start.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I need to pick one. The Complaint is the most logical first choice. The user's instructions say not to reread visited documents, but all are unvisited, so starting with Complaint makes sense.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint. The token count is 13,096. The maximum allowed per read is 10,000 tokens, so I'll read the first 10,000 tokens. The start_token is 0, end_token 10000. That way, I cover the beginning of the document where the filing date and parties are typically listed.\n\nNo regex needed here since the filing date is likely in a standard part of the Complaint. Using read_document directly on the Complaint's start makes sense. The other documents might have more details, but the Complaint is the best place to start for the initial filing details.\n\nCheck if there's a reason to use search_document_regex. The checklist items are specific, but the filing date might be a date in a particular format. However, since it's the first document, reading it directly is safer to avoid missing context. Regex could be used later if needed, but for now, reading the document is better.\n\nSo, the next action is to read the Complaint from tokens 0 to 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3615, "completion_tokens": 509, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract four checklist items from the legal case documents. The current status shows all keys are empty. The recent action was reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text provided, I need to find the Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, and Type_of_Counsel.\n\nFirst, Filing_Date. In the document header, it says \"Filed 06/09/25\" on Page 1. So the filing date is June 9, 2025. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, Who_are_the_Parties. The document lists Plaintiffs as Gavin Newsom (Governor) and the State of California. Defendants are Donald Trump (President), Pete Hegseth (Secretary of Defense), and the U.S. Department of Defense. The parties are described in the \"PARTIES\" section starting at paragraph 15. So Plaintiffs: Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of California; State of California. Defendants: Donald Trump, in his official capacity as President; Pete Hegseth, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense; U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nFor Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, the complaint is brought by the State of California and the Governor, so it's a state action. The document says \"Plaintiffs: State of California\" and \"Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor.\" Since it's a state and its official, it's not a class action. The plaintiffs are individual entities (the state and governor), so it should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom in his official capacity.\"\n\nType_of_Counsel: The attorneys listed are \"Attorney General of California\" and \"Deputy Attorneys General,\" so it's government counsel. The document states \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" and lists the California Attorney General's office, which is government counsel.\n\nNow, I need to check if all these are in the read text. The Filing_Date is on page 1. The parties are in the PARTIES section (page 4-5). The class action status is implied since it's a state suing, not a class. The counsel is government.\n\nWait, the checklist says for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since it's the State of California and the Governor, not a class, it's individual. So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom in his official capacity.\"\n\nType_of_Counsel: The attorneys are from the California Attorney General's office, which is government counsel. So \"Government Counsel.\"\n\nNow, evidence needs to be cited with text, source document, and location. For Filing_Date, the text is \"Filed 06/09/25\" on page 1. For Who_are_the_Parties, the parties are listed in the PARTIES section. For Class_Action, the complaint is brought by the state, so it's individual. For Type_of_Counsel, the attorneys are \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" from the CA AG's office.\n\nI need to make sure all these are extracted. The Complaint document has been partially read (0-10000 tokens), and the relevant sections are within that range. The PARTIES section starts on page 4, which is within the first 10k tokens.\n\nSo, I should use append_checklist to add these values. Each key gets one entry. For Who_are_the_Parties, it's two entries: Plaintiff and Defendant. Wait, the checklist says \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants...\" so each party should be a separate entry. But the format requires \"Plaintiff: [description]\" or \"Defendant: [description]\". So for Plaintiffs, it's \"Plaintiff: Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of California; Plaintiff: State of California\". Similarly, Defendants: \"Defendant: Donald Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; Defendant: Pete Hegseth, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense; Defendant: U.S. Department of Defense\".\n\nWait, the document lists the Plaintiffs as \"GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA\". So the Plaintiffs are two entities: the Governor as an individual in his official capacity, and the State itself. So the extracted values should be two entries for Plaintiffs.\n\nSimilarly, Defendants are three: Trump, Hegseth, DOD.\n\nSo for Who_are_the_Parties, the extracted list should have four entries: two Plaintiffs, three Defendants? Wait, no. The Plaintiffs are listed as \"Gavin Newsom...; State of California\", so two plaintiffs. Defendants: \"DONALD TRUMP...; PETE HEGSETH...; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\", so three defendants.\n\nBut the checklist says \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles...\". So each party should have its own entry. So the extracted values for Who_are_the_Parties should be:\n\n- Plaintiff: Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of California\n- Plaintiff: State of California\n- Defendant: Donald Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States\n- Defendant: Pete Hegseth, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense\n- Defendant: U.S. Department of Defense\n\nWait, but the document says \"Defendants\" include the Department of Defense as a defendant. So yes, five entries.\n\nBut the problem is, the user's checklist item says \"Who_are_the_Parties\" should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. So each party is a separate entry. So all five should be listed.\n\nBut let's check the document. In the PARTIES section (paragraphs 15-20), it lists:\n\n15. Plaintiff Gavin Newsom is the Governor of the State of California. In his capacity as Governor, Governor Newsom is the Commander-in-Chief...\n\n16. Attorney General Rob Bonta is the chief law officer... (but this is part of the plaintiffs' description, but the attorney is separate from the party. Wait, the party is the State and the Governor. The attorneys are the AG's office representing them.\n\nWait, the parties are:\n\nPlaintiffs: Gavin Newsom (in his official capacity), State of California.\n\nDefendants: Donald Trump (President), Pete Hegseth (Secretary of Defense), U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nSo the Who_are_the_Parties entries should be:\n\n- Plaintiff: Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of California\n- Plaintiff: State of California\n- Defendant: Donald Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States\n- Defendant: Pete Hegseth, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense\n- Defendant: U.S. Department of Defense\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: Since the plaintiffs are the State and the Governor, not a class action, it's Individual. The description would be \"State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom in his official capacity\".\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel: The attorneys are from the California Attorney General's office, which is government counsel. So \"Government Counsel\".\n\nNow, evidence for each:\n\nFiling_Date: \"Filed 06/09/25\" on page 1 (tokens 0-10000).\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: The PARTIES section on page 4-5, which is within the read tokens.\n\nClass_Action: The complaint is brought by the State, not a class, so the description is as above.\n\nType_of_Counsel: The \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" listed as the California AG's office.\n\nSo I need to append all these to the checklist. Since all are in the read document, I should use append_checklist with all the entries.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist has four items, and each can have multiple values. So for Who_are_the_Parties, it's multiple entries (5), but each is a separate entry.\n\nNow, the action to take is append_checklist with the extracted values. The document is Complaint, tokens 0-10000, which covers all these sections.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the four keys, each with their respective values and evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"06/09/25\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Case 3:25-cv-04870-CRB     Document 1     Filed 06/09/25     Page 1 of 22\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 header\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of California\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"15.
