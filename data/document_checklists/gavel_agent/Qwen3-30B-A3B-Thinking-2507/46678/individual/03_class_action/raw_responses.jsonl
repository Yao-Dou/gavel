The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

All 8 documents are unvisited, marked as ○ Unvisited. The current status shows that all keys are empty, so I need to start reading documents to find the relevant info.\n\nThe task is to find where the plaintiffs are designated as class or individual. The key terms might be in the Complaint, Docket, or motions. The Complaint is the first document listed, which usually states the nature of the suit. It's common for class actions to be mentioned there.\n\nSince the Complaint is the foundational document, I should read it first. The Complaint has 13,096 tokens, but I can read up to 10,000 tokens. Maybe start from the beginning. The \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" likely has the plaintiff's claim structure.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. The other documents might have info too, but starting with the Complaint makes sense. The Docket might have the case type, but the Complaint is more likely to have the plaintiffs' designation.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the target is specific. The checklist item is clear, so reading the main document first is better. So the next action is read_document for the Complaint from 0 to 10,000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3434, "completion_tokens": 398, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The current status shows it's empty, and I've already read part of the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000). \n\nLooking at the document content provided, I need to check if there's any mention of the plaintiffs proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. The document is a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by Gavin Newsom and the State of California. \n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs are listed as \"GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA\" as Plaintiffs. There's no indication that this is a class action. The case is brought by the State of California and the Governor in his official capacity, which suggests it's a sovereign entity acting on behalf of the state, not a class action with individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe checklist requires the value to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. Since this is a state government entity suing, it's not a class action. The plaintiffs here are the State of California and the Governor, so it's not individual plaintiffs either. Wait, but the instruction says \"with a brief description of the individuals when applicable.\" In this case, there are no individual plaintiffs; it's the state as a plaintiff.\n\nBut the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. Since it's the state suing, which is a sovereign entity, it's neither a class action nor individual plaintiffs. However, the problem states that if it's not applicable, we need to set it to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence. Wait, but the requirements say to extract every distinct value. If the case is brought by the state as a plaintiff, then it's not a class action, but is it considered individual plaintiffs? Probably not. \n\nWait, the checklist says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". But here, the plaintiffs are the State of California and the Governor in his official capacity. So it's not individual plaintiffs. So this case isn't a class action, and it's not individual plaintiffs either. Therefore, the item might be \"Not Applicable\" because the case isn't structured as a class action or individual plaintiffs. But I need to check if there's any mention of class action in the document.\n\nLooking through the text, there's no mention of \"class action\" or any similar term. The complaint is filed by the state, so it's a state action, not a class action. The checklist item is specifically for when plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or as individual plaintiffs. Since this is a state, not a class, it's not applicable. So the correct action is to set it to Not Applicable.\n\nBut wait, the user's instructions say that \"Not Applicable\" should be marked only if there's explicit evidence. The document doesn't say \"this is not a class action,\" but the fact that the plaintiffs are the State of California and the Governor in his official capacity suggests it's not a class action. However, the checklist definition says \"A designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs.\" Since the plaintiffs here are the state, which is a sovereign entity, it's neither. So the checklist item doesn't apply, hence Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, I should use update_checklist to set \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the document. The evidence would be the plaintiff identification in the complaint.\n\nLooking at the document, the plaintiffs are listed as \"GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA\". This is the state suing, not a class action. So the evidence is the plaintiff identification.\n\nSo the next step is to call update_checklist with the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" and the value \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the document.\n\nWait, but the current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so it's empty. Since there's no indication of class action or individual plaintiffs, it should be marked as Not Applicable. So the correct action is update_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Plaintiffs\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1, Line 17-18\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Plaintiffs", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1, Line 17-18"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14559, "completion_tokens": 1041, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, which needs to be either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already updated the checklist with \"Not Applicable\" based on the Complaint document. The evidence they provided is from Page 1, Lines 17-18, where it says \"GAVIN NEWSOM, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Plaintiffs\". \n\nWait, but the problem here is that the complaint lists the plaintiffs as \"GAVIN NEWSOM...; STATE OF CALIFORNIA\", which are two entities, but not a class action. The key point is whether they're proceeding as a class action. The complaint doesn't mention a class action, so it's likely that this is a case where the plaintiffs are the state and governor acting in their official capacities, not as a class. So \"Not Applicable\" makes sense here because the checklist item is about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. Since this is a state and governor, it's not a class action, but the item requires specifying if it's class or individual. Wait, but the checklist says \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" and the value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. \n\nWait, the current entry says \"Not Applicable\". But why? The user's evidence says \"Not Applicable\" because the plaintiffs are the state and governor, not a class. But maybe the checklist item is only relevant if it's a class action. Wait, the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the case isn't a class action, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user's previous step set it to Not Applicable based on the complaint. \n\nNow, checking the documents. The current state shows that the Complaint document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but the evidence they used was from the first page. The complaint is titled \"COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and lists the plaintiffs as the Governor and the State of California. There's no mention of a class action here. The case is being brought by the State and Governor, not as a class of individuals. So the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" item should be marked as Not Applicable because it's not a class action. \n\nBut wait, the checklist item's description says \"A designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs\". If the plaintiffs are the State and Governor, which are not individuals, then this item might not apply. So \"Not Applicable\" is correct. However, I need to make sure that there's no other document that might indicate a class action. The other documents listed are Docket, Order, etc. But the current status shows that all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. The checklist has only one key, which is marked as Not Applicable. \n\nThe user's recent actions show that they used update_checklist to set Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs to Not Applicable. The evidence is from the complaint. Now, the question is whether there are any other documents that might have information about this. But the task is to extract from all documents, but the complaint already shows it's not a class action. The other documents might be orders or motions, but if the complaint doesn't mention a class action, and the case is filed by the state, it's unlikely that the other documents would change that. \n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Not Applicable: 1/1\". So the only key is done. The next step is to check if all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's marked as Not Applicable, the system should stop. \n\nWait, the user's current step says \"Your Next Action\" and lists options. The possible actions include 'stop'. Since all keys are accounted for (one key, marked Not Applicable), the correct action is to stop. The reason is that the checklist item is correctly marked as Not Applicable based on the evidence from the complaint, and no other documents need to be checked because the item is not applicable. \n\nI should verify if there's any other document that might have a different value. But the complaint is the first document, and it's clear that the plaintiffs are the state and governor, not a class action. The other documents are motions or orders, which wouldn't change the plaintiff's status. So it's safe to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully processed.
