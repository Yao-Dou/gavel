The document catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the decision policy again. It says: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call list_documents.\" The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog hasn't been discovered. So the next action must be list_documents. No other actions make sense here because there are no documents to read or search. The user can't proceed without knowing what documents exist.

The complaint is usually where the legal claims are first stated, so the Complaint document is a good candidate. The other documents like motions and orders might reference it, but the complaint is the primary source.\n\nThe task says to extract every distinct value, so I need to read the complaint to find the specific provisions mentioned. Since the document is 13,096 tokens, I can't read the whole thing at once. But the max token range per read is 10,000, so I'll start with the first part.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting at token 0 to 10,000. That's within the limit. The next step after reading would be to check the text for the basis. The user's instructions say to avoid rereading, so I'll make sure not to revisit this document until necessary.\n\nWait, the recent actions already did list_documents, so the catalog is known. No need for that again. The next logical step is to read a document. The Complaint seems the best bet.

The user needs to extract the statutory or constitutional basis from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the provided document, which is the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The user read tokens 0-10000. I need to check if there's any mention of specific constitutional or statutory provisions.\n\nScanning through the text, I see in paragraph 57 where the Trump Memo cites 10 U.S.C. § 12406. Then in paragraph 57, it quotes the statute. The statute mentions \"10 U.S.C. § 12406\" which is the statutory basis. But the checklist says not to include the cause of action vehicle like 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but here it's the statute being used. Wait, the requirement says \"Do not include the cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), remedies, or procedural doctrines.\" So 10 U.S.C. § 12406 is the statute they're invoking, but the checklist item is about the substantive rights violated. Wait, the problem says \"the substantive rights and sources of law allegedly violated—the 'what' was violated—such as specific constitutional provisions or clauses (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection, First Amendment – Freedom of Association, Eighth Amendment) and statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504).\"\n\nSo 10 U.S.C. § 12406 is the statute they're using as authority, but the actual basis for the case is the constitutional and statutory rights being violated. Let me check if the complaint mentions specific constitutional clauses.\n\nLooking at paragraph 8: \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\" So that's referencing the Constitution, but not a specific amendment. Then in paragraph 9: \"The Constitution grants the States—not the federal Executive—the authority to conduct ordinary law enforcement activities...\" Again, general constitutional reference.\n\nParagraph 10 mentions the Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act is a statute (18 U.S.C. § 1365), so that's a statutory basis. The complaint says: \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.\" So the Posse Comitatus Act is a statutory basis.\n\nAlso, in paragraph 7: \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\" This refers to the Constitution, but which part? The Constitution's Article I, Section 8 gives Congress power to raise and support armies, and the Militia Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 15) says Congress can \"provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.\" But the complaint mentions the Constitution's general principle, not a specific amendment. However, the checklist example includes \"Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection,\" so they want specific clauses. The Constitution doesn't have a specific amendment for militia, but the Militia Clause is part of Article I. Wait, but the checklist says \"constitutional provisions or clauses,\" so maybe the Militia Clause is the basis.\n\nWait, the complaint also references the 10 U.S.C. § 12406 as the statute they're arguing is being misapplied, but the actual basis for the case is the constitutional right to state control of the National Guard. So the statutory basis would be the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1365), and the constitutional basis is the Militia Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 15) or the Tenth Amendment (reserving powers to states). Wait, the complaint says \"the Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias,\" which is a reference to the Tenth Amendment or the Militia Clause. The Tenth Amendment states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. So the Tenth Amendment might be the basis.\n\nWait, paragraph 8: \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\" That's a reference to the Tenth Amendment. So the Tenth Amendment is a constitutional basis.\n\nAlso, the Posse Comitatus Act is a statute. So the statutory basis would be the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1365), and the constitutional basis is the Tenth Amendment.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504)\", so the Posse Comitatus Act is a statutory basis. And \"constitutional provisions or clauses (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection)\" so the Tenth Amendment is a constitutional basis.\n\nLet me check the text again. In paragraph 10: \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules...\" So the Posse Comitatus Act is cited as the statute that prohibits military in civil law enforcement. So the statutory basis for the case's claim would be the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nThe constitutional basis is the Tenth Amendment (as per paragraph 8's reference to the Constitution reserving power to the states).\n\nWait, but the complaint also mentions \"the Constitution\" in paragraph 9: \"The Constitution grants the States—not the federal Executive—the authority to conduct ordinary law enforcement activities...\" So that's another constitutional reference, but it's the same as the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment is the one that reserves powers to the states, so it's the main basis.\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\n- \"Tenth Amendment\" (constitutional basis)\n- \"Posse Comitatus Act\" (statutory basis)\n\nBut need to check if the complaint explicitly states these as the basis. The complaint's arguments are that the President violated the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) and the Posse Comitatus Act. So the statutory basis is Posse Comitatus Act, constitutional basis is Tenth Amendment.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"the substantive rights and sources of law allegedly violated\". So the rights violated are under the Tenth Amendment (state's right to control militia) and the Posse Comitatus Act (prohibiting military in civil enforcement).\n\nSo the distinct values are \"Tenth Amendment\" and \"Posse Comitatus Act\".\n\nNow, evidence:\n\nFor Tenth Amendment: Paragraph 8 mentions \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\" The Tenth Amendment is the constitutional basis here.\n\nFor Posse Comitatus Act: Paragraph 10: \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.\"\n\nSo the evidence for each would be the quoted text.\n\nNow, the checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", so each distinct value (Tenth Amendment, Posse Comitatus Act) should be a separate entry.\n\nCheck if there are other mentions. The complaint also cites 10 U.S.C. § 12406, but that's the statute the defendants are using, not the basis for the plaintiffs' claim. The plaintiffs are arguing that the defendants violated the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) and the Posse Comitatus Act. So 10 U.S.C. § 12406 is not the basis but the statute they're misapplying. So it shouldn't be included.\n\nSo the two values are Tenth Amendment and Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nNow, need to create evidence for each. The document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is the paragraph numbers (e.g., paragraph 8 for Tenth Amendment, paragraph 10 for Posse Comitatus Act).\n\nThe tokens read are 0-10000, which covers up to page 16, so paragraphs 8 and 10 are within the read tokens.\n\nSo the next action is to append these two values to the checklist. Since it's a new extraction, use append_checklist.\n\nEach entry needs evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nFor Tenth Amendment:\n- value: \"Tenth Amendment\"\n- evidence: text from paragraph 8, location \"Page 8, paragraph 8\" (since it's page 8 in the document, but the token range might not have page numbers. Wait, the document shows page numbers like \"Page 8 of 22\", so location can be \"Page 8\".\n\nSimilarly, Posse Comitatus Act: text from paragraph 10, location \"Page 10\".\n\nSo the append_checklist call should have two entries under the key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\".\n\nWait, the checklist key is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", so the key name is exactly that.\n\nSo the patch should have key: \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", and extracted array with two entries.\n\nEach entry has evidence (array of one evidence object) with text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the evidence for Tenth Amendment:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\",\n  \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"location\": \"Page 8\"\n}\n\nFor Posse Comitatus Act:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.\",\n  \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"location\": \"Page 10\"\n}\n\nSo the append_checklist parameters would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Tenth Amendment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 8\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Posse Comitatus Act\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 10\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the checklist requires each value to be a separate entry. So two entries under the same key.\n\nYes, the extracted array can have multiple entries for the same key.\n\nSo this should be the correct action. Since the user read the document and found these values, the next step is to append them.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, so this will add two entries.\n\nNo other documents need to be read yet because the required values are found in the already read document.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the two entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Tenth Amendment\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 8\"}]}, {\"value\": \"Posse Comitatus Act\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 10\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case", "extracted": [{"value": "Tenth Amendment", "evidence": [{"text": "The Constitution reserves to the States power over their respective state militias—now the National Guard—unless the State requests or consents to federal control.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 8"}]}, {"value": "Posse Comitatus Act", "evidence": [{"text": "The Posse Comitatus Act codifies these strict rules, prohibiting the military from engaging in civil law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by law.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 10"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14658, "completion_tokens": 2705, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The available documents include Docket, Order, and several motions. Since the Complaint is fully read, I should check other documents for additional statutory or constitutional bases.\n\nThe user's recent actions show they read the Complaint up to token 13096, which is the entire document. Now, they need to check the other documents. But the instructions say not to reread visited documents. So, the next logical step is to check if any other documents might contain the required basis.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract specific constitutional provisions or statutes. The current extracted values are Tenth Amendment and Posse Comitatus Act. Are there any other mentions in other documents?\n\nFor example, the Docket or Orders might reference other constitutional clauses. But since the user hasn't read those yet, I need to decide whether to read a document or search for a pattern.\n\nThe available documents are mostly unvisited. The best approach is to use `search_document_regex` to look for common constitutional references or statutory citations. But the instructions say to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable, like \"Case No.\" or citations.\n\nLooking at the checklist item, the values are things like \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"ADA Title II\", etc. So, a regex pattern like \"Amendment [IV|V|VI|VII|VIII|IX|X|XI|XII|XIII|XIV|XV|XVI|XVII|XVIII|XIX|XX|XXI|XXII|XXIII|XXIV|XXV|XXVI|XXVII|XXVIII|XXIX|XXX]\" or \"10 U.S.C. § [0-9]+\", but that might be too broad.\n\nWait, the user's current extraction has \"Tenth Amendment\" and \"Posse Comitatus Act\". The Posse Comitatus Act is a statute, so maybe other statutes like \"10 U.S.C. § 12406\" but the checklist says not to include the cause-of-action vehicle (like 42 U.S.C. § 1983), so 10 U.S.C. § 12406 is the statute cited in the complaint but not the basis. The basis should be the constitutional or statutory right being violated, like the Tenth Amendment or Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nSo, the regex should look for constitutional amendments (like \"Tenth Amendment\", \"First Amendment\", etc.) or specific statutes mentioned as the basis. But the checklist says to extract the basis, not the statute used to invoke it.\n\nIn the Complaint, they mention \"Tenth Amendment\" and \"Posse Comitatus Act\". The other documents might have more. For example, in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, they might cite other constitutional clauses.\n\nBut since I don't have the content of the other documents, I should search them. The best action is to use `search_document_regex` to look for constitutional amendments or the Posse Comitatus Act. But the Posse Comitatus Act is a specific statute, so maybe search for \"Posse Comitatus Act\" and \"Amendment\" followed by a number.\n\nWait, the user's previous action was reading the Complaint, which was fully visited. Now, they need to check other documents. The next step should be to search the other documents for possible references to constitutional bases.\n\nSo, the correct action is to use `search_document_regex` with a pattern that matches constitutional amendments or the Posse Comitatus Act. But the checklist says to extract the basis, so the pattern should target phrases like \"Tenth Amendment\", \"First Amendment\", \"Posse Comitatus Act\", etc.\n\nThe pattern could be something like: `(Tenth Amendment|First Amendment|Second Amendment|...|Posse Comitatus Act)`. But listing all amendments might be tedious. Alternatively, a pattern like `\\b(Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act)\\b`.\n\nBut since the user is supposed to use precise patterns, maybe search for \"Amendment\" followed by a Roman numeral or \"Posse Comitatus Act\".\n\nHowever, the instructions say to use `search_document_regex` with a pattern that's anchored to document structure. So, perhaps a regex like `Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act`.\n\nWait, the user's current extraction has two values. They need to check if there are more. The other documents might have additional mentions. For example, the Order or the Motion might cite other constitutional provisions.\n\nSince the user hasn't read those documents yet, the next step is to search them. So, call `search_document_regex` with the pattern to find those terms.\n\nThe parameters for `search_document_regex` need a pattern, and optionally doc_name or doc_names. Since all documents are unvisited, maybe search all documents. But the user might want to target specific ones. However, the instruction says to use 'all' for searching all documents.\n\nSo, the function call should be `search_document_regex` with pattern `Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act` and doc_name='all' to search all unvisited documents.\n\nWait, the pattern should be case-insensitive, so add IGNORECASE flag. The pattern might be `Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act` with IGNORECASE.\n\nBut the user's example in the instructions uses precise patterns.

The user is working on extracting statutory or constitutional bases from legal documents. The current task is Step 6, and they've already extracted two values: \"Tenth Amendment\" and \"Posse Comitatus Act\" from the Complaint document.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they did a search_document_regex for \"Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act\" across all documents. The search found 26 matches, but most of the matches are in the Complaint, which is already fully visited (100% coverage). The other documents like Order, Order Granting TRO, Defendants' Opposition, etc., have some matches but are only partially visited (3-5% coverage).\n\nThe key point here is that the Complaint is already fully read (tokens 0-13096), so no need to read it again.

For example, in the Order Granting TRO, they mention \"Posse Comitatus Act\" again, but it's the same as before.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value. The user has two values already: Tenth Amendment and Posse Comitatus Act. The search results don't show any new distinct bases.

The other matches in the search results are either repetitions or in the same context.\n\nThe current status shows 2 values extracted, and the keys with values are 1/1. The empty keys and Not Applicable are 0. So, the checklist item is complete. But wait, the user needs to confirm if there are any other distinct bases. The search was done for \"Amendment [IVX]+\" which would catch any amendment (like First, Fourth, etc.), but in the search results, the only amendment mentioned is the Tenth Amendment. The \"Posse Comitatus Act\" is a statutory basis, which is already extracted.\n\nLooking at the search results in the Defendants' Opposition document, there's a mention of \"Posse Comitatus Act\" again, but that's the same as before.

The Defendants' Notice might not have the statutory bases. But the search was already done across all documents, and the matches found are all related to the two already extracted.\n\nWait, the search pattern was \"Amendment [IVX]+|Posse Comitatus Act\", so it's looking for specific amendments (like Tenth, First, etc.) and the Posse Comitatus Act. The search results show that the only amendment mentioned is Tenth, and Posse Comitatus Act. There's no mention of other amendments like First Amendment, which was mentioned in the Complaint but as part of the context (protesters exercising First Amendment rights), but the checklist says not to include cause-of-action vehicles or procedural doctrines. The First Amendment was mentioned in the Complaint (lines 21-22), but the user didn't extract it because it's about the protesters' rights, not the basis for the case. The checklist specifies: \"Do not include the cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), remedies (injunctive relief, damages), or purely procedural doctrines (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young). Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\"\n\nSo the First Amendment mention is about the protesters' rights, not the legal basis for the case. The actual legal bases for the case are the Tenth Amendment and Posse Comitatus Act. Therefore, no new values are found in the search results.\n\nThe user has already extracted both values from the Complaint, which is fully visited. The other documents' partial matches don't add new values. So the checklist item is complete. The next action should be to stop, as all values are extracted.\n\nWait, but the user might need to confirm with get_checklist to make sure there are no other keys. But the checklist only has one key: Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case. The current status shows it's filled with 2 values. The system says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Since this key has two values, and there are no empty keys, the process should stop.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop, using the stop decision with the reason that all distinct values have been extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct statutory/constitutional bases (Tenth Amendment, Posse Comitatus Act) have been extracted from fully visited documents.

The user is asking me to extract the statutory or constitutional basis from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\".\n\nFrom the prior steps, they've already extracted two values: \"Tenth Amendment\" and \"Posse Comitatus Act\". The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief document was fully visited (tokens 0-13096), and those two values were found there. \n\nNow, looking at the current status: the system says \"All distinct statutory/constitutional bases (Tenth Amendment, Posse Comitatus Act) have been extracted from fully visited documents. No new distinct values found in remaining documents via regex search.\" So they've done a regex search on all documents and found matches, but no new values beyond the two already extracted.\n\nThe available documents show that some are partially visited (like Order, Order Granting TRO, etc.), but the regex search already covered those and didn't find any new statutory bases. The other documents (Docket, Defendants' Notice) are unvisited, but the regex search was done on all documents, so those unvisited ones probably don't have the relevant info.\n\nThe checklist status shows 1 key filled with 2 values, and the system says it's complete. The user called stop at step 6, but the system is asking for a second stop attempt. Since no new values were found in the regex search, and the two existing values are already extracted with evidence from the fully visited document, there's nothing more to do. \n\nSo the next action should be to stop again, confirming that all values are extracted. The system allows a second stop as final. The reason would be that all distinct values have been found in the fully visited document and no new ones were found in other documents via regex search.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct statutory/constitutional bases (Tenth Amendment, Posse Comitatus Act) have been extracted from fully visited documents.
