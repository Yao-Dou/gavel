Congress provided SIJS for children and youth under the age of 21 who obtain specific factual determinations by a state court with jurisdiction over their custody. Namely, the state court must find that (1) reunification with one or both of the youth\u2019s parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or similar basis under state law, and (2) it is not in the youth\u2019s best interest to be returned to their country of origin."
