The user needs to extract related cases listed by their case code numbers from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item is empty. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out what documents are available. Since there are no documents listed, the next logical action is to call list_documents to get the catalog. The system's decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, use list_documents. Here, it's definitely unknown because the corpus has 0 documents. \n\nI shouldn't try to read or search documents because there are none to read. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which don't exist here. So, the correct first action is to list the documents. That's the only possible step to move forward. The user's instructions say to choose one action, and list_documents is the right one here.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 211, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and it's currently empty.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are 10 documents, all unvisited. The user has already done a list_documents in Step 1, so the catalog is known. The next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain case numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most probable to have related case numbers. The \"Docket\" document (12,331 tokens) is a good candidate because dockets often list related cases, case numbers, and other procedural details. The \"Complaint\" might also have some references, but dockets are more structured for that purpose.\n\nSince the Docket is unvisited, reading it first makes sense. The maximum token range for a read is 10,000 tokens, but the Docket is 12,331 tokens. So I should read the first 10,000 tokens (from 0 to 10000) to get the beginning part where related cases might be listed. The rest can be read later if needed, but starting with the first chunk is efficient.\n\nThe other option is using search_document_regex to look for patterns like \"Case No.\" or \"Case Number\", but since the task is to extract all distinct values, and the Docket is a likely source, reading it directly might be more efficient than searching. Plus, the regex might not be precise enough, and the user should avoid broad patterns.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Docket, starting at 0, ending at 10000. That's within the 10k token limit. Once that text is read, I can check for case numbers and then append them to the checklist if found.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3447, "completion_tokens": 449, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the provided documents. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the current status. The checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" is completely empty (0 values extracted), and there's one document partially visited: Docket (tokens 0-10000). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nHmm, the Docket entry is a docket sheet listing court filings. I should check if any case numbers appear here. The user provided the first 10,000 tokens of the Docket document. Let me scan through that text.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, I see several mentions of other cases. For example, entry 77 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (20-36052) re 76 Order on Motion for Summary Judgment...\" and entry 78 mentions \"TIME SCHEDULE ORDER (20-36052)\". Then later, entry 84 says \"NOTICE of Pendency of Other Action in Central District of California, case number(s) in other court 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\".\n\nAh! Here's a clear case code: \"2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\". That's a related case number. Also, entry 56 mentions \"USCA Case Number 19-35884\" from the appeal. So both \"19-35884\" and \"2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\" are case codes.\n\nWait, let me confirm these are the only ones. Scanning further, entry 77 has \"20-36052\" for the appeal. So that's another case number. Entry 81 refers to \"20-36052\" again. Entry 83 mentions \"20-36052\" in the mandate.\n\nSo the related case codes I found are:\n- 19-35884 (from entry 56, 57)\n- 20-36052 (from entries 77, 78, 81, 82, 83)\n- 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR (from entry 84)\n\nI should check if these are distinct. Yes, they're different case numbers. Now I need to extract each with evidence. \n\nFor \"19-35884\", it's in entry 56: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (19-35884) re 42 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction...\". The evidence text would be that line, source document is Docket, location is entry 56.\n\nFor \"20-36052\", entries 77-83 mention it. Entry 77 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (20-36052) re 76 Order on Motion for Summary Judgment\". So evidence is that line.\n\nFor \"2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\", entry 84: \"NOTICE of Pendency of Other Action in Central District of California, case number(s) in other court 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\".\n\nAll these are in the Docket document, which I've already partially read (tokens 0-10000). Since I've already read the relevant parts, I should now append these to the checklist.\n\nI need to make sure each entry has proper evidence: verbatim text, source document, location. The location can be the docket entry number (e.g., \"Docket Entry 56\").\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n- \"19-35884\" from Docket Entry 56\n- \"20-36052\" from Docket Entry 77\n- \"2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\" from Docket Entry 84\n\nNo \"Not Applicable\" here since we found values. I'll use append_checklist to add these three entries. Since the checklist item allows multiple values, I'll add them all at once in one append_checklist call.\n\nWait, the user said \"EVERY distinct value\", and these are distinct. I should verify no duplicates. 19-35884, 20-36052, and 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR are all different, so three entries.\n\nNow, for evidence:\n- For 19-35884: text is \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (19-35884 ) re 42 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", source \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 56\"\n- For 20-36052: text is \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (20-36052) re 76 Order on Motion for Summary Judgment\", source \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 77\"\n- For 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR: text is \"NOTICE of Pendency of Other Action in Central District of California, case number(s) in other court 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\", source \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 84\"\n\nAll good. Now I'll format this as an append_checklist action with three entries. The key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nI should make sure the evidence has the required fields: text, source_document, location. The location here is the docket entry number, which is acceptable as per the instructions.\n\nNo need for other actions since I've found the values in the already-read document. I won't need to read more documents or use regex since the values are directly visible in the Docket.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"19-35884\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to Ninth Circuit (19-35884 ) re 42 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 52 Order on Motion for Reconsideration by Defendants Lee Francis Cissna, Robert Cowan, Kirstjen M Nielsen, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, United States Department of Homeland Security.

The user wants me to extract all checklist items from the provided documents. The current task is to extract \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" which are case numbers from other related cases.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the Docket document (tokens 0-10000) and found three case numbers: 19-35884, 20-36052, and 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR. They appended these using append_checklist. The Docket document is partially visited (81% coverage), so they might need to check if there are more entries in the remaining tokens.\n\nBut the Docket entry 79 to 97 mentions the case numbers 19-35884 and 20-36052 again, but they've already been extracted. The third one, 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR, was found in entry 84. Are there any other related cases mentioned in the remaining tokens of the Docket?\n\nThe Docket is 12,331 tokens, and they read 0-10000. The remaining tokens would be 10000-12331. Let me check if any other case numbers appear there. The snapshot shows the Docket entries up to 97, but the read was only up to 10000 tokens. The actual Docket text provided in Step 2 includes entries up to 97, but maybe the token count includes more. Wait, the Docket entry 97 is cut off in the provided text: \"97 | 2023-09-15 | NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF COUNSEL: Attorney Meghan E Casey for All Plaintiffs. (Kang, Leila) (Entered: 09/15/202\" – so maybe the full entry is longer. But since the read was up to 10000 tokens, which covers most of the Docket (since it's 12,331 tokens), perhaps the remaining tokens don't have new case numbers.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about related cases listed by their case numbers. The three values found are from the Docket entries 56, 77, and 84. Are there any other entries that mention other case numbers? Let's scan the provided Docket text again.\n\nLooking through the entries:\n\n- Entry 56: Notice of Appeal to Ninth Circuit (19-35884)\n- Entry 77: Notice of Appeal to Ninth Circuit (20-36052)\n- Entry 84: Notice of Pendency of Other Action in Central District of California, case number 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR\n\nAny others? Let's check entries 79-97. Entry 79 mentions USCA (20-36052), but that's the same as entry 77. Entry 81 mentions 20-36052 again. Entry 84 is the one with the Central District case number. Entry 85, 86, etc., don't mention other case numbers. Entry 84 is the only one with 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR. The other entries reference the same appellate case numbers.\n\nSo the three values are all from the Docket. The Docket's remaining tokens (10000-12331) might not have more case numbers. The next step would be to check if there are other documents that might have more related cases. The available documents list other documents like Complaint, Amended Permanent Injunction, etc. But the checklist item is about related cases, which are typically mentioned in the docket entries as appeal numbers or other case numbers. The other documents (like the Complaint or Orders) might not list other case numbers; they might refer to the current case.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So the related cases would be other cases that are related to this one, like appeals or other proceedings. The three found are the appellate cases (19-35884, 20-36052) and the other action in Central District (2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR). \n\nThe other documents (Complaint, Orders, etc.) might not contain additional case numbers. For example, the Complaint is the initial filing, so it might not reference other case numbers. The Orders might reference the current case but not others. The Amicus Brief might mention other cases, but the checklist item is about the case code numbers, so perhaps the Docket is the main source.\n\nSince the Docket was partially read, and the three values were extracted from it, maybe there are no more. But to be thorough, the next step would be to check the remaining tokens of the Docket to ensure no other case numbers are present. The Docket is partially visited (0-10000), so reading the next token range (10000-12331) could be done with read_document.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents have case numbers. For example, the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might reference other cases, but the checklist item is about related cases to the current matter, so it's likely the appellate cases and the other district court case.\n\nThe user's recent action was append_checklist with the three values. The current status shows all keys have values (1/1), but they need to confirm if there are more values. However, the Docket's remaining tokens might not have more, but to be safe, they should check.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 84 mentions 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR, which is the Central District case. The other entries (like 79-83) reference 20-36052, which is the same as entry 77. So no new values there.\n\nThe next logical step is to check if there are any other documents that might have related case numbers. But the other documents (like the Complaint, Orders) are probably not listing other case numbers. The \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment\" (entry 76) might reference the appellate case, but it's already covered in the Docket.\n\nWait, the checklist item is to extract all distinct values. The three values found are distinct. So maybe they have all of them. But the system says to extract EVERY distinct value found in any document. So if the Docket has all, then the three are all.\n\nBut the user's current state shows that the Docket is partially visited. To confirm, they should read the remaining tokens of the Docket to make sure no other case numbers are there. For example, maybe the very end of the Docket has another reference.\n\nThe Docket has 12,331 tokens, and they read 0-10000. The remaining is 10000-12331 (2331 tokens). So they should read that range to check.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be read_document on Docket, tokens 10000-12331. That way, they can confirm if there are more case numbers in the remaining part of the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 12331}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12331}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14079, "completion_tokens": 1670, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract related cases from legal documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" checklist item. From the recent actions, they've already extracted three values: 19-35884, 20-36052, and 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR. These were all found in the Docket document, which is now fully visited (tokens 0-12331).\n\nNow, looking at the current status, the Docket is fully visited, so there's no need to read it again. The other documents are unvisited (marked with ○), like the Complaint, Amended Permanent Injunction, etc. But the checklist item is about related cases, which are typically mentioned in docket entries or notices of appeal. The Docket already has the three values, but maybe there's another case number in the other documents.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" The three extracted values are from the Docket entries (56, 77, 84). The other documents might have more case numbers. For example, the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might reference another case. But the user's recent step 4 read the Docket up to token 12331, which seems to cover all docket entries. The Docket is fully visited, so no more new entries there.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited, but do they likely contain related case numbers? Let's check the document names. The \"Brief of Amicus Curiae State of Washington\" might mention other cases. The \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment\" could reference prior cases. But the checklist is about related cases listed by their case codes, so maybe the other documents have case numbers in their text.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to extract every distinct value found in any document. The Docket already provided three values, but maybe another document has another one. For example, the \"Notice of Pendency of Other Action\" in Docket 84 mentions 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR, which was already extracted. But maybe another document like the Complaint or the Amended Permanent Injunction has a case number.\n\nWait, the Complaint is a document. Sometimes complaints reference related cases. But in the Docket, the related cases are already listed as appeal numbers and other case numbers. The Docket is the primary place where related cases would be mentioned in the context of the case. The other documents are orders or briefs, which might cite other cases but not necessarily list them as \"related matters\" in the sense of the checklist.\n\nThe checklist item says \"related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" The three values extracted are appeal numbers (19-35884, 20-36052) and a district court case number (2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR). The Docket has all of these. The other documents might not have additional case numbers that are related to this case. For example, the Order Granting Summary Judgment might reference the same cases, but not new ones.\n\nThe user's current status shows 3 values extracted, all from Docket. The other documents are unvisited, but the Docket is fully visited, and the other documents might not contain additional related case numbers. The task is to extract \"every distinct value,\" so if the Docket has all the related cases listed, then no need to check other documents.\n\nWait, but the system's decision policy says to use `get_checklist` to assess remaining gaps. The current checklist has one key, which has three values. The user's recent action was appending those three. Now, they should check if all values are extracted. Since the Docket is fully visited and the other documents are unvisited, but the related cases are likely in the Docket (as they're mentioned in docket entries like notices of appeal), maybe there are no more values. But to be thorough, maybe check if the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" has another case number.\n\nHowever, the checklist item is about the case codes listed in the documents. The three values are already extracted. The next step might be to use `get_checklist` to confirm all values are present. Wait, the user's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled. The key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" has three values, and the checklist is complete. But the user should verify if there are more.\n\nWait, looking at the Docket entries, entry 84 mentions 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR, which was extracted. Entry 56 has 19-35884, entry 77 has 20-36052. Are there any other entries that mention case numbers? For example, entry 79-83 are USCA case numbers, but those are the same as 20-36052. Entry 84 is the only other case number. So three distinct values.\n\nThe other documents like the Complaint or Amended Permanent Injunction might not have new case numbers. For instance, the Amended Permanent Injunction (Docket 99) might reference the case, but not another case number. The \"Order Granting Summary Judgment\" (76) refers to the same case. So probably no more values.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to check if all values are extracted. The current status shows 3 values, but to confirm, use `get_checklist` to see if the key is complete. Wait, the user's step 3 already appended the three values. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the key is filled. So maybe it's time to stop.\n\nWait, the stop criteria is when all applicable checklist items are fully extracted. There's only one checklist item, which has three values. The Docket is fully visited, and no more values are likely in other documents. So the next step is to stop.\n\nBut according to the system's process, before stopping, they should verify with `get_checklist`. However, the user's recent action was appending the three values, and the status shows 3 values. The next logical step is to call `get_checklist` to confirm, but the decision policy says to stop when all keys are complete. Since the key is already filled (3 values), and the Docket is fully visited, there's no need to read more documents. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's step 4 read the Docket up to 12331, which is the end, so the Docket is fully visited.

The user is asking me to extract related case codes from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 already appended three values from the Docket document: 19-35884, 20-36052, and 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR. Then Step 4 read more of the Docket (tokens 10000-12331), but the new entries (98-126) don't mention any new case codes. The Docket is fully visited (100% coverage), so no more text there.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion, etc. But the checklist is about case codes, which are typically in docket entries or notices of appeal. The existing evidence came from Docket entries (56, 77, 84). The other documents are orders or briefs, which might not list related case numbers. For example, the Opinion (81) mentions the case number 20-36052 but that's the same as the one already extracted. The Amended Permanent Injunction (99) refers to the case but doesn't list a related case code.\n\nThe system says Docket is fully visited and no other documents have been checked. But the other documents are unlikely to contain new case codes. The checklist definition says \"any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes,\" so unless another document explicitly states a case number (like \"related to 2:22-cv-01510\"), there's nothing new.\n\nThe current checklist has 3 values, all from Docket. The document catalog shows all other documents are unvisited, but reading them would be inefficient since the Docket already covered all case codes mentioned. The stop decision in Step 5 was correct because the Docket is fully covered and the other documents don't seem relevant. The automatic `get_checklist` in Step 6 confirms 1/1 key filled with 3 values.\n\nSo, no more values to extract. The next action should be to stop since all applicable items are extracted. The system allows a second stop attempt, so this is the final stop.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All related case codes (19-35884, 20-36052, 2:22-cv-01510-ODW-JPR) extracted from fully visited Docket document.
