The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are 10 unvisited ones. The Complaint is the most likely place to find the filing date since it's the initial document. The Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is the primary source for the filing date.\n\nThe user has already listed the documents, and the Complaint is marked as unvisited. Since the goal is to find the filing date, reading the Complaint makes sense. The Complaint is 18,696 tokens, but the system allows up to 10,000 tokens per read. So I should read the first part of the Complaint to find the date.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000. That's within the limit. The Docket might have it too, but the Complaint is the first place to check. The other documents like Orders and Motions are probably later in the case, so the filing date would be in the Complaint.\n\nNo regex search needed yet because the filing date is likely in the beginning of the Complaint.

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. Looking at the provided snapshot, they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document.\n\nIn the complaint, I see \"Filed 03/05/19\" on the first page. That's clearly the filing date. The document is titled \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and the date appears right after \"Document 1\" on the header. \n\nThe requirement says to extract EVERY distinct value, but since this is the only document read so far and the date is clearly stated, I should extract \"03/05/19\" as the filing date. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. \n\nThe location is \"Case 2:19-cv-00321-RSL Document 1 Filed 03/05/19 Page 1 of 30\" - I'll note the page as \"Page 1\" since token positions aren't specified beyond the read range. The source document is \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" (abbreviated as [Complaint] in the catalog).\n\nI need to use append_checklist since this is a new value for the Filing_Date key. The value should be \"03/05/19\" but I should confirm if the date format needs standardization. The document uses MM/DD/YY so I'll keep it as is since the requirement says \"verbatim snippet\" for evidence.\n\nNo other dates are visible in the read portion, and the other documents haven't been accessed yet. Since the task is to extract from all documents, I should consider reading more documents later, but for now I have one valid value from the complaint.\n\nWait - the checklist summary shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\" for Filing_Date, so I'm on the right track.

The user is asking me to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. So far, they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document and found the date \"03/05/19\" on page 1. The checklist item Filing_Date has one value extracted.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are more documents that might have the same or additional filing dates. The current status shows that only one document has been partially read (Complaint), and the rest are unvisited. But the task is to extract every distinct value of Filing_Date from all documents.\n\nWait, the checklist item is specifically for the filing date of the lawsuit. The Complaint document's header says \"Filed 03/05/19\", which is the filing date. But maybe other documents like the Docket or Orders might have the same or different dates? However, in legal cases, the filing date is usually the same across all documents as the initial filing. But sometimes, there might be amendments or different dates for other filings. But the checklist specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court,\" so it's the original filing date.\n\nSince the Complaint is the first document, and it's labeled as Document 1 with the filed date, that's likely the correct date. But I should check if other documents might have the same date or if there's a possibility of another date. For example, the Docket might list the filing date again, but it's probably redundant. However, the requirement is to extract every distinct value. So if other documents also mention the same date, it's still the same value, so no need to add duplicates.\n\nThe current extracted value is \"03/05/19\". The next step is to check if there are other documents that might have a different filing date. But since the lawsuit's filing date is the initial date, all other documents would reference that same date. However, maybe some documents like the Amended Complaint might have a different date, but the checklist is for the first filing. The user's task is to extract the first filing date, so even if there's an amended complaint, the original filing date is still the same.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is unvisited. The Docket might list the filing date. But since the Complaint already has it, and the Docket is likely to have the same date, maybe it's redundant. However, the instructions say to extract every distinct value found in any document. So if the Docket also says \"Filed 03/05/19\", it's the same value, so no new entry needed.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if there are other dates. Wait, the Complaint's header says \"Filed 03/05/19\", which is the date. The next step is to check if any other document has a different filing date. But given the context, it's unlikely. However, to be thorough, maybe check the Docket document, which is the next most likely place to find the filing date.\n\nThe Docket document has 12,331 tokens and is unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document to see if it contains the filing date. But since the Complaint already has it, maybe it's redundant. However, the system requires checking all documents to ensure all values are captured. But the checklist item is for the first filing date, which is a single value. So even if multiple documents have it, it's still one distinct value.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 already appended the value from the Complaint. The next action should be to check if there's any other document that might have a different value. But since the filing date is the same across all documents for the case, there's no other value. So the checklist should be complete with one value.\n\nBut let me confirm. The Docket document might have the same date. If I read the Docket and find the same date, it's the same value, so no need to append again. If there's a different date, then it would be a problem, but that's unlikely.\n\nThe current status shows that all keys (only Filing_Date) have 1 value, and no empty or Not Applicable. So the checklist is complete. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: • Complete: all relevant values present in the corpus for that key have been extracted, each with evidence. • Not Applicable: represented as a single extracted entry with value 'Not Applicable'.\"\n\nSince there's one value, and it's correctly extracted from the Complaint, and there's no indication of other values or need for Not Applicable, the checklist is complete. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut wait, the user might need to verify if all documents have been checked. However, the system's policy says not to reread visited documents, and the Complaint is partially visited (53% coverage), but the relevant date was found in the first 10k tokens. The rest of the document might not have additional filing dates. The other documents are unvisited, but they're not likely to have a different filing date for the case. The filing date is the initial date, so other documents would reference that same date. So no new values would be found.\n\nTherefore, the checklist is complete.
