The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the documents in the corpus count is 0.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first.

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents, there's a \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" which sounds like it would mention the class action status. The name itself suggests it's a class action. But I need to confirm by reading the document.\n\nThe other documents are orders, opinions, and motions. Some might reference the class action status, like the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. But the complaint is the most direct place to start. The document is unvisited, so I should read it.\n\nThe complaint is 18,696 tokens, but the max per read is 10k tokens. So I'll start from the beginning, maybe read the first 10k tokens. The user said to avoid rereading, so since it's unvisited, I can read the first chunk.\n\nWait, the decision policy says to use read_document for targeted windows. The complaint is the most relevant. Let me check if there's a better way. The checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, so the complaint would state that upfront. The other documents like the order for class certification would confirm it, but the complaint is primary.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the complaint document. Start from token 0 to 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. I'll use read_document with doc_name \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nNo need for regex here since the document name suggests it's the right place. Using search_document_regex might be overkill. So, the correct action is read_document on the complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3484, "completion_tokens": 475, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to format the value as either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the document that's been partially read: the Complaint. The user provided the first 10,000 tokens of this document. Scanning through the text, I notice the document is titled \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\" on page 1. The plaintiffs are listed as Leobardo Moreno Galvez, Jose Luis Vicente Ramos, and Angel de Jesus Muñoz Olivera, \"on behalf of themselves as individuals and on behalf of others similarly situated\". The phrase \"on behalf of others similarly situated\" is a key indicator of a class action. Also, the complaint explicitly states \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" in the header and mentions \"Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge...\".\n\nLooking at the specific sections: on page 1, line 11 says \"Plaintiffs, COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\". Then on page 2, line 18 states \"Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge...\". The plaintiffs are named as individuals but they're suing on behalf of a class. So the correct extraction here is \"Class Action\".\n\nI need to confirm there's no indication of individual plaintiffs. The document clearly labels it as a class action complaint. The plaintiffs are named as individuals but the suit is a class action, so the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nNow, checking the evidence. The exact text from the document: \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\" on page 1, and \"Plaintiffs bring this class action...\" on page 2. The source document is \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", and the location is page 1 and page 2. Since the token range read was 0-10000, which covers these pages, I can use that.\n\nI need to format the evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text can be the header line and the phrase \"class action\" in the complaint. The location can be specified as \"Page 1\" and \"Page 2\" as per the document's page numbers.\n\nSince this is the first extraction, I should use `append_checklist` to add this value. The key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The evidence will include the text snippets from the document.\n\nWait, the checklist item requires the format to be 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual...'. So the value should be exactly that string. The evidence needs to show where this is stated.\n\nLooking at the text:\n\n- Page 1: \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\"\n- Page 2: \"Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge...\"\n\nSo the evidence text can be \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\" and \"Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge...\". The source document is \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", and location is \"Page 1\" and \"Page 2\".\n\nI need to structure the evidence as an array of objects with text, source_document, and location. Since there are two references, I can include both in the evidence array.\n\nSo the extracted value would be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and the evidence includes both text snippets.\n\nNow, checking if this is the only value. The document clearly states it's a class action, so no need for \"Individual\" description. The key is now filled, so I should append this entry.\n\nThe next action after reading the document is to append the checklist item. Since the user has read the document and found the value, the correct action is `append_checklist` with the patch containing the key and the extracted value with evidence.\n\nI should make sure that the evidence has the exact text. Let me verify the tokens. The text on page 1: \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\" is on line 11. The token range 0-10000 includes that, so it's valid.\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call would be append_checklist with the patch for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, with the extracted value and evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge the federal government's policy\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Class Action", "evidence": [{"text": "COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF", "source_document": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "location": "Page 1"}, {"text": "Plaintiffs bring this class action to challenge the federal government's policy", "source_document": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "location": "Page 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14380, "completion_tokens": 1219, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint, which was partially read (tokens 0-10000). Step 3 was append_checklist, which successfully added one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from the complaint.\n\nNow, the current status shows that all keys (just one) have values. The checklist summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", and \"Not Applicable: 0/1\". The document catalog shows that the Complaint document is partially visited (53% coverage), but the other documents are unvisited.\n\nWait, but the checklist item only needs to be extracted once. The complaint already has the class action designation. The user's requirement is to extract every distinct value. Since the complaint says \"COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION\" and \"Plaintiffs bring this class action\", that's clear. The other documents might have more info, but the checklist item is already filled. The system's policy says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract the class action status. The extracted value is already present. There's no indication that other documents would have a different value for this key. For example, if another document was a different case, but the complaint is the main document. The other documents are orders or motions, which might confirm the class action but don't add new values for this specific key.\n\nThe extraction progress shows 1 value from the complaint. The checklist item is complete. The next step should be to check if there's any need to look further. But according to the stop criteria, if all keys are filled, stop. The current state has 1/1 keys filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is filled.
