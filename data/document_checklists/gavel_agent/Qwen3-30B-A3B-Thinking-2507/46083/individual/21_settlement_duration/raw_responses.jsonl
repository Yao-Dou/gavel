The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the first function to call here is list_documents. There's no need to read or search any documents yet because there are none to read. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system needs to discover them first.

The task is to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the provided documents. The user has already listed 10 documents, and the current status shows that the key is empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain settlement duration information. The checklist specifies that settlement obligations not incorporated into court orders should be included. So, documents like the \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" (Order/Opinion) seem promising because they're directly related to settlement approvals. Other documents like the Complaint or Docket might not have the specific duration details.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" is a good candidate. It's a court order approving the settlement, so it probably includes the duration of the settlement obligations. The other orders (like for class certification or injunctions) might not have settlement details, but the settlement approval order is the most relevant.\n\nI should use `read_document` to access this specific document. The document is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I need to read a portion of it. Since it's 1,579 tokens, which is under 10k, I can read the whole thing. But to be efficient, maybe start from the beginning. The user's instructions say to avoid rereading, but since it's unvisited, reading the entire document is okay.\n\nWait, the document name is \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement [Order/Opinion]\". The key here is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", so the settlement duration would be in this document. Let's call `read_document` with the full token range (start 0, end 1579) to get all the text.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use `search_document_regex` to find specific terms like \"settlement duration\" or \"term\", but since the document is small, reading it directly might be faster. The user's policy says to use `read_document` as the default choice when targeting a specific document. So, I'll go with `read_document` for the settlement approval order.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1579}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1579}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3493, "completion_tokens": 510, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which needs the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was reading the \"Order Granting Joint Motion...\" document from tokens 0-1579. The user provided the text from that document. Now, I need to check if that document contains the settlement duration.\n\nIn the document text, I see sections about the settlement. Let me scan through it. The order mentions the Settlement Agreement dated May 17, 2024. Then, in the body, there's a part under \"WHEREAS\" that says \"the Settlement Agreement dated May 17, 2024, setting forth the terms and conditions for the settlement of...\" But it doesn't specify the duration. Then later, in the order, it says \"The Agreement provides that Defendants shall pay Plaintiffs the amount of $400,000...\" but again, no mention of how long the settlement lasts.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the settlement duration must be for obligations not incorporated into a court order. The order itself is a court order approving the settlement, so the actual settlement terms might be in the Settlement Agreement document, not in the order. But the user hasn't provided that document yet. The available documents include \"Order Granting Joint Motion...\" which is fully visited, but the actual Settlement Agreement might be a separate document. However, looking at the document list, there's no \"Settlement Agreement\" listed. The documents are all court orders, complaints, dockets, etc. The Settlement Agreement might be referenced in the order, but the order itself doesn't state the duration.\n\nThe user's example says to extract the duration as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". In the provided text, there's no explicit duration mentioned. The order just says the settlement is approved, but the duration isn't stated here. So maybe the duration isn't in this document. The next step would be to check other documents. But the current available documents that are unvisited include the Complaint, Docket, Amended Permanent Injunction, etc. The Complaint might have the settlement terms if it's a class action settlement, but typically the complaint would state the claims, not the settlement duration. The Settlement Agreement itself would have the terms, but it's not listed here. Wait, the document names don't include a Settlement Agreement. The only related document is the \"Order Granting Joint Motion...\" which we've already read.\n\nSince the Order doesn't mention the duration, and the other documents are unvisited, I should check if any of the other documents might contain the settlement duration. But the checklist says to extract from the documents provided. The Order is fully visited, and no duration was found there. So maybe the duration is not present, but the instructions say not to mark as Not Applicable without explicit evidence. However, the user's task is to extract every distinct value. If none are found, but we can't confirm it's Not Applicable yet, we need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Complaint - Class Action...\" which is unvisited. Maybe the complaint mentions the settlement terms? But usually, the complaint would state the claims, and the settlement would be in a separate agreement. However, sometimes in class actions, the settlement terms might be outlined in the complaint if it's a settlement agreement being filed. But the complaint is typically the initial filing, not the settlement.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Docket\" might have entries about the settlement. The Docket is a document that lists all filings, so maybe the settlement agreement is listed there with terms. But the user hasn't read it yet. The current status says all keys are empty, so we need to find the duration.\n\nBut the user has to choose one action. The previous step was reading the Order, which didn't have the duration. Now, since the Order is fully visited and no value was found, the next step is to look at other documents. The most likely candidates are the Settlement Agreement, but since it's not listed, maybe the \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" or other orders. Wait, the document names don't include a Settlement Agreement, so perhaps the settlement terms are in the Order or another document.\n\nWait, the Order's text says \"the Settlement Agreement dated May 17, 2024\", so the actual agreement is a separate document, but it's not in the list. The available documents are the ones listed. So maybe the settlement duration isn't in any of the provided documents. But the task is to extract from the provided documents. If none have it, then we might need to set it as Not Applicable. However, the Not Applicable requires explicit evidence. For example, if the case was dismissed without a settlement, but here it's a settlement being approved, so the settlement exists, but the duration might not be in the documents. Wait, the problem says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The Order is the court order, so the actual settlement terms (duration) would be in the Settlement Agreement, which isn't in the provided documents. Therefore, the duration isn't in any of the provided documents. But do we have evidence that it's not present?\n\nThe Order refers to the Settlement Agreement, but the Agreement itself isn't part of the corpus. So the documents provided don't contain the settlement duration. Therefore, we should mark it as Not Applicable. But wait, the Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry with \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence would need to state that the settlement duration isn't in the provided documents. But the instructions say \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\"\n\nIn this case, since the Settlement Agreement (which would contain the duration) is not among the provided documents, the duration isn't present in the corpus. However, the Order mentions the Agreement exists, but the duration isn't in the Order. So maybe the duration is not in the corpus. But the user's documents don't include the Agreement, so the duration can't be extracted. Therefore, we need to set it as Not Applicable. But how to confirm?\n\nWait, the Checklist Summary says \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", meaning it's empty. The user needs to either fill it or mark as Not Applicable. Since the settlement duration isn't in any of the documents we've checked (the Order is fully visited), and the other documents haven't been read, perhaps we should check another document. But the most likely place would be the Settlement Agreement, which isn't listed. So the next logical step is to check if any other document might have it. However, the available documents don't include a Settlement Agreement, so maybe the duration is in another order.\n\nWait, looking at the Order, it says \"the Settlement Agreement dated May 17, 2024\". If the Settlement Agreement was filed as part of the case, it should be in the documents. But the document list provided doesn't have it. So perhaps it's not present, and the duration can't be extracted. Therefore, we should mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe another document like the Complaint or Docket might reference it. Let's check the document names again. The documents are:\n\n- Order Granting Joint Motion...\n- Complaint\n- Docket\n- Amended Permanent Injunction\n- Opinion\n- Order Granting Class Certification\n- Order Granting Preliminary Injunction\n- Order Granting Summary Judgment\n- Order Regarding Motion for Reconsideration\n- Amicus Brief\n\nThe Complaint might mention the settlement terms if it's a settlement case, but typically the complaint is the initial filing. The Docket might list the settlement agreement as a filed document. Let's assume the Docket is the next best place to check. The Docket is 12,331 tokens, unvisited. So the next action should be to read the Docket document, possibly using read_document or search_document_regex.\n\nBut the user's current step is after reading the Order. The Order didn't have the duration, so we need to check other documents. The most efficient way might be to use search_document_regex on the Docket for \"settlement\" or \"duration\" to find relevant sections. But since the user can only do one action, maybe read the Docket. However, the Docket is large (12k tokens), so reading the whole thing might be inefficient. Alternatively, use search_document_regex with a pattern like \"settlement duration\" to find where it's mentioned.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", so the pattern could be \"settlement duration\" or \"duration of settlement\". So using search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement duration\" might find it. Let's consider that.\n\nAlternatively, the Order mentioned the Settlement Agreement, but the duration isn't there. The Docket might list the settlement terms. So the next action should be to search the Docket for the term \"settlement duration\" to find where it's mentioned.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call search_document_regex on the Docket document (doc_name: \"Docket\") with pattern \"settlement duration\" to see if it's present. If it is, then read that section. If not, check other documents. But since we need to do one action, search_document_regex is appropriate here.\n\nWait, the user has to choose exactly one action. The previous step was read_document on the Order, which was fully visited. Now, since the Order didn't have the value, the next step is to check other documents. The Docket is a likely candidate because it lists all filings, so the settlement agreement might be referenced there with terms. So using search_document_regex on the Docket for \"settlement duration\" would be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't find it in the Docket, check the Complaint. But the Docket is more likely. So the action should be search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\" and pattern \"settlement duration\".\n\nWait, the pattern should be precise. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", so the exact wording might not be used. The duration could be phrased as \"duration of the settlement\" or \"settlement period\". So the pattern should be flexible. But the instructions say to use precise patterns. Maybe \"settlement duration\" is a common phrase. Let's use that.\n\nSo the function call would be search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\" and pattern \"settlement duration\". But the tool parameters: doc_name can be a single name or 'all'. Here, we want to search the Docket document specifically. So doc_name: \"Docket\", pattern: \"settlement duration\".\n\nWait, the pattern is case-insensitive, but the regex can be made case-insensitive with flags. But the default is to not use flags, so the pattern is case-sensitive. However, the text might have \"Settlement Duration\" with capitalization. To cover that, maybe add IGNORECASE flag. But the default is no flags, so maybe include it to be safe.\n\nBut the user's example in the tools shows flags as optional. So include \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"] to make it case-insensitive.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\ndoc_name: \"Docket\"\n\npattern: \"settlement duration\"\n\nflags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]\n\ntop_k: 5 (default)\n\ncontext_tokens: 200 (default)\n\nYes, that's the way to go. So the next action is to call search_document_regex on the Docket document with that pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"settlement duration\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "settlement duration", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5350, "completion_tokens": 2508, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The other 9 documents are unvisited. The checklist item is still empty.\n\nHmm, the Order document mentions the settlement but doesn't specify a duration. Let me double-check that text. The key parts are about the $400,000 payment and the court retaining jurisdiction, but no mention of how long the settlement lasts. The regex search for \"settlement duration\" returned zero matches, so that's probably not in the Docket either.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The Order document is a court order approving the settlement, so any duration mentioned there would be incorporated into the court order. That means I shouldn't extract anything from this document for this checklist item. \n\nSo the Order document is fully visited and doesn't have the required info. Now I need to check other documents. The next logical step is to read another document that might contain the settlement duration.

Since it's unvisited, I should read a portion of that. But to be efficient, maybe I should first try a regex search on all documents for terms like \"settlement duration\", \"term\", \"period\", \"ongoing\", etc. But the user's recent action already tried \"settlement duration\" with zero matches.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract the duration as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". Maybe the duration is phrased differently. Let me think of common terms: \"for a period of\", \"for 3 years\", \"ongoing\", \"indefinite\", \"until compliance\", etc.\n\nSince the regex search on \"settlement duration\" didn't work, maybe I should try a broader pattern.

The available documents include the Docket and others that are unvisited. The Docket might have settlement-related info, like dates or duration.

The regex might need to be adjusted, but the user's instruction says to use precise patterns.\n\nWait, the Order document mentioned the settlement agreement but didn't specify the duration. The complaint doesn't talk about settlements at all. The next step is to check other documents. The Docket is unvisited and might contain settlement details. So, the next action should be to read the Docket document. But since the previous regex search on Docket with \"settlement duration\" didn't find anything, maybe try a different pattern. However, the problem states to use `search_document_regex` only when the target is clearly patternable. Since \"settlement duration\" didn't work, perhaps the Docket has the info in a different way. Alternatively, read the Docket document directly to check for settlement terms.\n\nWait, the Docket is listed as unvisited.

The user needs me to extract \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" from the documents, specifically the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into court orders.\n\nFirst, I'll review what's been done so far. The previous steps included:\n- Listing documents (10 total found)\n- Reading the Order Granting Settlement Agreement (tokens 0-1579)\n- Searching Docket for \"settlement duration\" (0 matches)\n- Reading Complaint (tokens 0-10000)\n- Reading Docket (tokens 0-10000)\n\nNow looking at the current status: only \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" is empty, with 0 values extracted. The Order Granting Settlement Agreement was fully read (✓ Fully Visited), but I need to check if it contains settlement duration info.\n\nLet me re-examine the Order document snippet provided in Step 2. The key part is:\n> \"2. The Agreement provides that Defendants shall pay Plaintiffs the amount of $400,000 in costs are reasonable.\"\n\nWait, this mentions payment amount but no duration. The settlement terms seem to be about payment, not time-bound obligations. The court order says it's incorporating the agreement, so this might not qualify as a settlement obligation outside court order.\n\nThe Complaint (Step 4) talks about SIJS petitions and USCIS delays, but no settlement duration mentioned. The Docket (Step 5) is just a timeline of court events.\n\nHmm... the key instruction says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" The Order document shows the settlement was incorporated into the court order (it says \"the Settlement Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference\"), so this doesn't count. \n\nI need to check other documents that might contain settlement terms. The available documents show:\n- Amended Permanent Injunction (unvisited)\n- Opinion (unvisited)\n- Other Orders (unvisited)\n\nBut the user's task specifically says \"settlement duration\" for negotiated agreements not in court orders. Since the only settlement mentioned is in the court order (which we've read), I should check if any other documents describe a settlement without court incorporation.\n\nWait—the Complaint mentions \"settlement\" but it's about a class action lawsuit, not a settlement agreement. The Docket shows case progression but no settlement terms.\n\nI should consider if \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" might be Not Applicable. But the requirement says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\"\n\nLooking at the case history:\n- The case went to summary judgment (Step 76)\n- There was an appeal (Steps 77-83)\n- Then a joint status report (Step 88) about revising the injunction\n\nBut no mention of a settlement agreement outside court orders. The \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" is the only settlement document, and it's court-ordered.\n\nSo the evidence suggests there is no settlement obligation outside court orders.

So marking it as Not Applicable is correct based on the evidence.\n\nNow, checking the documents. The Order Granting Joint Motion is fully visited (✓), so no need to read it again. The Complaint and Docket have been partially read. The Complaint (tokens 0-10000) was read, but the settlement duration might not be in there. The Docket (tokens 0-10000) was also read. The other documents are unvisited, but the task is to extract settlement duration, which might be in the Order or other settlement-related documents.\n\nWait, the Order that was read (Order Granting Joint Motion) is the one that approved the settlement. The key point here is that the settlement terms are incorporated into the court order, so per the checklist definition, we shouldn't extract the duration because it's part of the court order. Therefore, the Not Applicable is correct.\n\nBut I should check if there are other documents that might have a settlement agreement not incorporated into a court order. The other documents listed are like Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion, etc. The Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment might have settlement terms, but the current status shows that the checklist is already marked as Not Applicable. However, the user's recent action was an update_checklist setting it to Not Applicable, so maybe there's no need to look further.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if the settlement is part of the court order (like the Order Granting Joint Motion), then it's not applicable. But if there's a separate settlement agreement outside the court order, then we should extract it. However, in this case, the Order mentions the Settlement Agreement is incorporated by reference, so it's part of the court order. Therefore, Not Applicable is correct.\n\nNow, the current status shows all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. The only key is How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, which is marked Not Applicable. The next step would be to stop, as all keys are accounted for.\n\nWait, the user's step 6 was an update_checklist setting it to Not Applicable. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Not Applicable: 1/1\", so all keys are covered. The system should stop now.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other document that might have a settlement duration outside a court order. The Complaint is a complaint, not a settlement. The Docket is a list of filings, but the settlement was approved via the Order. The other documents like Amended Permanent Injunction might have settlement terms, but the Order already incorporated the settlement into the court order, so even if they mention duration, it's part of the court order. Therefore, the Not Applicable is correct.\n\nSo, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.

The user is trying to extract the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" checklist item from legal documents. The task is to find all distinct values of this item, formatted as '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already marked \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement. The evidence cited is from page 2, lines 20-21, where the court incorporated the settlement agreement into the order.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if the settlement is part of the court order, it shouldn't be extracted. The evidence they have shows that the settlement terms are incorporated into the court order, which is why it's marked as Not Applicable.\n\nNow, checking the documents. The Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to re-read it. The other documents are either partially visited or unvisited. But since the checklist item is already marked as Not Applicable based on a fully visited document, there's no need to look further.\n\nThe system's automatic checklist review shows that all keys are filled (1/1), and the key is marked as Not Applicable. The user tried to stop at step 7, but the system requires a second stop attempt. The current step is after the automatic `get_checklist`, and the status is still showing the key as Not Applicable with evidence.\n\nThe available documents include others like the Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion, etc., but since the settlement is already confirmed as part of the court order (hence Not Applicable), there's no need to check other documents. The checklist item is correctly marked as Not Applicable based on the evidence from the Order document.\n\nThe user's next action should be to stop again. The system allows two stop attempts, and this is the second one. The reason is that all checklist items are fully extracted, with the only item marked as Not Applicable with supporting evidence.
