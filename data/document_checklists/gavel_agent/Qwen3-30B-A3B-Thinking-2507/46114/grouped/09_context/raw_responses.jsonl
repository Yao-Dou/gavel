The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown.

Therefore, the correct action is to list the documents first. I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents exist.

The Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (Complaint) is the starting point of a lawsuit, so it should detail the facts of the case. The other documents like Docket, Memorandum, and Motions might have some facts but the Complaint is primary.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited (○ Unvisited).

The user is asking me to extract the checklist item \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the provided legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and the only document read so far is the Complaint, which is fully visited.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the Complaint contains any factual basis information. The Complaint document is the first one read, and it's a legal complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The description of the checklist item says it should include details of relevant events, evidence, and background.\n\nLooking at the text from the Complaint, there are several sections that detail the facts. For example, paragraphs 26-39 talk about the factual allegations: Vought being named Acting Director, his actions like instructing employees to stop work, requesting $0 funding, closing headquarters, etc. Also, paragraphs 43-57 describe the harm to the plaintiffs, which includes specific events and their impact.\n\nI need to extract all these factual details as separate entries. Each paragraph that provides a distinct fact or event should be a separate extracted value. The evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location (page number here).\n\nWait, the user mentioned that each extracted value should be self-contained. So, for each key fact, I should create an entry with the specific text from the document. Let me go through the Complaint again to identify all the factual points.\n\nParagraph 26: Vought named Acting Director on Feb 7, 2025.\nParagraph 27: Trump administration wants to dissolve CFPB.\nParagraph 28: Vought was part of Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.\nParagraph 29-31: Vought's immediate actions after becoming Acting Director (email to stand down, request $0 for Q3).\nParagraph 32-34: Details about the reserve fund and Vought's comments.\nParagraph 35-37: Further actions like closing headquarters, comments by Vought and Trump.\nParagraph 39: Elon Musk's social media posts.\nParagraph 43: Baltimore's demographics and historical issues with lending.\nParagraph 44-47: How Baltimore relies on CFPB for consumer protection.\nParagraph 48-52: Economic Action's programs and reliance on CFPB.\nParagraph 53-55: Use of CFPB's complaint database and HMDA data.\n\nEach of these should be a separate extracted entry. But wait, the checklist item says \"every distinct value,\" so each of these facts is a distinct value. However, the user also says \"when multiple values exist, create separate entries.\" So each factual point is a separate entry.\n\nBut I need to check if the evidence meets the requirements: verbatim text, source document, location (page number). The Complaint is the source, and the page numbers are given in the document (e.g., Page 7, 8, etc.).\n\nFor example, the entry for Vought being named Acting Director would have the text from paragraph 26, source \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location \"Page 7\".\n\nI should make sure not to miss any. Let's list them:\n\n1. Vought appointed Acting Director on Feb 7, 2025 (para 26, p.7)\n2. Trump administration seeks to dissolve CFPB (para 27, p.7)\n3. Vought's involvement with Project 2025 (para 28, p.7)\n4. Vought's email to employees to stand down (para 30, p.8)\n5. Vought's $0 funding request (para 31, p.8)\n6. Vought's comment on reserve fund (para 32-34, p.8)\n7. Closure of CFPB headquarters (para 35, p.8)\n8. Vought's comments on CFPB being \"woke\" (para 36, p.8)\n9. Trump's public statements to close CFPB (para 37-38, p.8-9)\n10. Elon Musk's social media posts (para 39, p.9)\n11. Baltimore's population demographics (para 43, p.9)\n12. Baltimore's consumer protection efforts using CFPB (para 44-47, p.10-11)\n13. Economic Action's programs relying on CFPB (para 48-52, p.11-12)\n14. Use of CFPB's HMDA data (para 54-55, p.12)\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"details of relevant events, evidence, background.\" So all these are part of the factual basis. Each should be a separate extracted value.\n\nBut the user's example in the checklist might expect grouping, but the instructions say \"every distinct value,\" so each fact is separate. However, the example in the Complaint shows that each paragraph is a separate fact. So I need to create entries for each.\n\nNow, since the Complaint is fully read, and these facts are in it, the next step is to append these to the checklist. The current status shows 0 values extracted, so I should use append_checklist to add all these entries.\n\nWait, but the user said \"each extracted value should be self-contained,\" so each fact as a separate entry. So for Factual_Basis_of_Case, each of these points is an entry with evidence.\n\nI need to structure each entry with value (the fact), evidence (text, source, location). Let's make sure the text is verbatim.\n\nFor example, for paragraph 26:\n\nValue: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\"\n\nEvidence: text from para 26, source \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location \"Page 7\".\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the document's page numbers are in the header (e.g., Page 7 of 15), so location can be \"Page 7\" or \"Page 7 of 15\".\n\nNow, the next action after reading the document is to append the checklist entries. Since the document is fully read, and we have the facts, the correct action is to call append_checklist with all these entries.\n\nBut the user says \"choose exactly one action per turn.\" So I need to generate the append_checklist call with all the entries.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted. ... Your next action MUST be append_checklist or update_checklist if you found extractable values in the text just read.\"\n\nSo since the read_document was done on the Complaint, and we found the facts, the next action is append_checklist.\n\nNow, I need to make sure all the entries are included. Let me list them properly.\n\nChecklist key: Factual_Basis_of_Case\n\nEntries:\n\n1. Value: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\"\n   Evidence: text from para 26, source \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location \"Page 7\"\n\n2. Value: \"The Trump administration, acting through Defendants CFPB and its Acting Director, Russell Vought, seeks to defund the CFPB by fiat, using its statutory funding mechanism to transfer away operating reserves.\"\n   (from para 12-13, but maybe better to take exact text. Wait, the exact text is in para 12: \"Defendants seek to use the CFPB’s statutory funding mechanism, by which it draws funds directly from the Federal Reserve System of which it is a part, see 12 U.S.C. 5491, 5497, to effectively defund the CFPB and leave it unable to carry out its congressionally mandated mission and specific statutory responsibilities.\")\n   So value: \"Defendants seek to use the CFPB’s statutory funding mechanism, by which it draws funds directly from the Federal Reserve System of which it is a part, to effectively defund the CFPB and leave it unable to carry out its congressionally mandated mission and specific statutory responsibilities.\"\n\nBut wait, the checklist is about facts, so the factual basis includes the allegations made in the complaint. So the plaintiffs' allegations are part of the factual basis.\n\nSo each of the factual allegations (paras 26-57) should be included as separate entries.\n\nBut maybe the user expects the most significant facts. However, the instructions say \"every distinct value,\" so all of them.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll include all the key factual points as separate entries.\n\nWait, but the user's example in the problem statement says \"For example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved.\" So each of those elements in the text should be captured.\n\nSo for each paragraph that describes a fact, create an entry.\n\nLet me list the specific paragraphs with their text:\n\nPara 26: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\"\n\nPara 27: \"The Trump administration—in general and Defendant Acting Director Vought in particular—have made no secret of their desire to dissolve the CFPB.\"\n\nPara 28: \"Prior to serving in the Trump-Vance administration, Vought was an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Mandate for Leadership, Project 2025, which calls for abolishing the CFPB, asserting that the agency is 'highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable.'\"\n\nPara 29: \"Vought moved quickly to hamstring the Bureau and its operations after being named Acting Director.\"\n\nPara 30: \"On February 8, the day after he became Acting Director, Vought instructed CFPB employees via an all-hands email to '[s]tand down from performing any work task.'\"\n\nPara 31: \"That same day, Vought notified the Board of Governors that, as Acting Director, he was requesting $0 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.\"\n\nPara 32: \"Vought’s letter implied that the Bureau would be able to rely on a purported reserve balance of $711,586,678 to continue carrying out its authorities during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.\"\n\nPara 33: \"The letter also indicated that the Bureau’s reserve fund was neither required by statute nor necessary to fulfill the Bureau’s mandate.\"\n\nPara 34: \"Vought closed the letter by, among other things, committing to 'cut this excessive [reserve] fund.' Later on X, Vought noted with regard to the reserve fund that, 'This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off.'\"\n\nPara 35: \"The next day, Sunday, February 9, the Bureau’s Chief Operating Office emailed all CFPB employees informing them that the Bureau’s D.C. headquarters would be closed from February 10 through February 14.\"\n\nPara 36: \"Also on February 9, Vought said that the CFPB has been 'a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.'\"\n\nPara 37: \"This week, President Trump confirmed that he plans to close down the Bureau, which he stated 'was set up to destroy some very good people.'\"\n\nPara 38: \"During a White House press conference, Trump said the CFPB was 'very important to get rid of.'\"\n\nPara 39: \"On February 10, after Vought announced that the CFPB would not be drawing funds for the third quarter in light of its supposed reserves of $711 million, Elon Musk posted on social media, 'CFPB has $711M? That money should be returned to taxpayers.' Days earlier, on February 7, 2025, Mr. Musk had posted 'CFPB RIP' to social media and commented in a reply to the post that CFPB 'need[s] to go.'\"\n\nPara 43: \"Baltimore is the largest city in Maryland, with a population of over 600,000. According to the 2020 Census, 60 percent of Baltimore’s population is Black, 27 percent is White, 8 percent is Hispanic or Latino, and 2.5 percent is Asian. Five percent of the City was identified by the Census as being of two or more races.\"\n\nPara 44: \"Among its other missions, the Baltimore City Law Department has responsibilities to protect Baltimoreans from predatory business practices of all kinds, including misleading practices, unfair and deceptive practices, and discrimination in lending.\"\n\nPara 45: \"For example, historic consumer protection legislation passed in 2023 updated the city’s consumer protection ordinance and gave the Law Department important new powers to take action against companies who harm Baltimore citizens through unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.\"\n\nPara 46: \"Representatives of the Law Department have active accounts with the CFPB consumer complaint database, which it accesses to understand the issues facing the people of Baltimore and to obtain information regarding potential predatory practices that affect the economic wellbeing of the city and its residences. Staff for the City of Baltimore have attended trainings put on by the CFPB to stay abreast of current issues in consumer protection and fair lending in order to be able to serve the people of the City.\"\n\nPara 47: \"In addition, CFPB’s vigorous enforcement efforts and its oversight of federal consumer protection laws provides an invaluable complement to Baltimore’s efforts to protect its residents from scams and abuse. Without CFPB, people in Baltimore would be more at risk of being tricked and trapped by shady financial practices, and the city would be forced to divert resources from other essential functions just to provide the same level of protection that residents enjoy now. Moreover, without the CFPB, Baltimore would be deprived of important information regarding potential predatory practices and consumer protection efforts that it has used to best serve the people in its boundaries.\"\n\nPara 48: \"Plaintiff Economic Action provides direct assistance to individuals, including with programs that support Maryland households with medical debt, economic security, housing, and other matters.\"\n\nPara 49: \"Economic Action’s Securing Older Adult Resources (SOAR) program supports older adults’ economic security, in part, by providing direct consumer education on financial exploitation and common scams. As a part of this effort, Economic Action has used the CFPB’s educational materials to inform older adults about scams and to encourage them to submit complaints to the Bureau.\"\n\nPara 50: \"Economic Action also works to support consumers facing challenges related to medical debt, an issue that affects a significant share of people in Maryland. Economic action provides resources to individuals as a part of its medical debt efforts, including its Guide to Medical Debt, which recommends that consumers who are victims of illegal and abusive debt collection tactics file complaints with the Bureau.\"\n\nPara 51: \"Helping people submit complaints to the CFPB to address problems with financial scams, debt collection, medical debt, fair housing, and other issues has been an important tool supporting Economic Action’s work.\"\n\nPara 52: \"Without the CFPB’s complaint database, Economic Action’s work would be significantly impaired, and it would be required to devote more resources and more counselors’ time to achieve the same results for the people it serves. Resolving issues with banks and debt collectors, for example, is more difficult when only an individual consumer is involved and the private entity is not receiving the consumer’s complaint from a government agency.\"\n\nPara 53: \"The CFPB’s complaint database is also important for multiple areas of Economic Action’s work, as the CFPB’s release of anonymized and redacted complaints allows Economic Action to identify emerging problems that can have serious consequences for consumers here in Maryland. Economic Action uses the complaint database to better understand issues that are particularly prevalent for Maryland consumers.\"\n\nPara 54: \"Further, Economic Action relies on other resources provided by the CFPB, including the information and data about mortgage loans that the CFPB collects and publishes under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HDMA”). HMDA requires lenders to report loan-level information about mortgages and mortgage applications, which the CFPB then compiles, analyzes and publishes. That information in turn helps Economic Action and groups like it to understand trends in the mortgage market, including identifying potential fair lending issues or where lenders are just failing to meet the housing needs of their communities.\"\n\nPara 55: \"There is no replacement available for the CFPB’s HMDA database. No other source has such comprehensive or authoritative information about consumer mortgage lending. If the database were taken down or compromised in a way that prevented Economic Action from relying on it, that would directly interfere with Economic Action’s ability to help borrowers and to advocate for fairer housing policies.\"\n\nEach of these is a distinct factual basis element. So for the checklist, each of these should be a separate entry under Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to the checklist. The function is append_checklist, and the patch should include the key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" with an array of extracted entries, each with evidence.\n\nSo I need to structure the JSON for append_checklist with these entries.\n\nBut wait, the user's example in the problem statement shows that the checklist item can have multiple values. So each of these is a separate value in the extracted list.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the evidence includes the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nFor example, for para 26:\n\nevidence: [\n  {\n    text: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\",\n    source_document: \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n    location: \"Page 7\"\n  }\n]\n\nvalue: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\"\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"each extracted entry must include evidence with text, source_document, location.\"\n\nSo for each entry, the evidence is an array of one item (since it's one text snippet), but the evidence field in the extracted entry is an array of evidence objects.\n\nWait, the evidence in the extracted entry is an array. So for each value, the evidence array can have multiple entries if there's more than one supporting text, but in this case, each fact is supported by one paragraph.\n\nSo for each fact, the evidence array has one element.\n\nNow, the append_checklist function's patch should have key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" with extracted array containing each value and its evidence.\n\nBut the user's example in the tool description shows that extracted is an array of objects with evidence (array) and value.\n\nSo for each entry in the extracted array, it's:\n\n{\n  \"value\": \"the fact text\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"verbatim text\",\n      \"source_document\": \"...\",\n      \"location\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSo I need to create multiple entries in the extracted array for the Factual_Basis_of_Case key.\n\nNow, considering the token limit, but the user hasn't mentioned any limit on the number of entries. The problem states \"all checklist items specified in the snapshot,\" so all these facts should be included.\n\nHowever, the user might expect to include the most relevant ones, but the instructions say \"every distinct value,\" so I should include all.\n\nBut wait, the document has 15 pages, and the facts are spread out. The user's example in the problem statement's Complaint shows these paragraphs, so I'll include them.\n\nBut to save time and avoid exceeding the response length, perhaps I should list the key facts. However, the assistant must extract all, so I'll proceed to list them.\n\nNow, the next action is to call append_checklist with all these entries. Since the document is fully read, and we've identified all the facts, this is the correct next step.\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call should be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          { ... for each entry ... }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nBut the problem is that the response must be valid JSON, and the user expects only one action. So I need to generate the correct JSON for append_checklist with all the entries.\n\nHowever, given the character limit, I can't list all 15 entries in the response, but the system should handle it. Wait, but the user's problem statement expects the assistant to output the JSON for the tool call.\n\nSo I'll structure the JSON with all the entries. Let's take a few examples to show the format, but in reality, the assistant would include all.\n\nWait, but the actual response must be the JSON tool call. So I'll create the append_checklist call with all the extracted entries.\n\nBut to be practical, I'll list the first few entries in the example to show the format, but the actual response should include all. However, since the assistant's response is limited, I'll include all necessary entries as per the instructions.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the user provided the full text of the Complaint, so the assistant should have extracted all facts from it. Therefore, the append_checklist should have all those entries.\n\nSo the correct action is to call append_checklist with all the Factual_Basis_of_Case entries from the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 7\"}]}], \"value\": \"The Trump administration—acting through Defendants CFPB and its Acting Director, Russell Vought—seeks to defund the CFPB by fiat using the CFPB’s statutory funding mechanism to transfer away operating reserves, leaving it unable to carry out its congressionally mandated mission.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Trump administration—acting through Defendants CFPB and its Acting Director, Russell Vought—now seeks to do by fiat what opponents of the CFPB were unable to do in Congress or the courts.

{"step": 4, "run_id": "04f093d1-2700-4a31-83ce-8969c88478d3", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T17:52:26.039860-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user is asking me to extract the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" checklist item from the legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and the only document read so far is the Complaint (which is fully visited). The previous attempt to append the checklist failed because the patch was missing the \"key\" field.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" entails. The definition mentions facts or evidence supporting the case, including events, evidence, and background. The Complaint document has a section titled \"Factual Allegations\" starting from paragraph 26, which details the events leading to the lawsuit.\n\nLooking at the text from the Complaint, paragraphs 26-42 describe key events: Vought being named Acting Director on Feb 7, 2025, instructing employees to stop work, requesting $0 funding, mentioning the $711M reserve, closing headquarters, and Trump's statements. These are all factual allegations forming the basis of the case.\n\nThe user's previous error was using `append_checklist` without the required \"key\" field. So, I need to structure the next action correctly. Since the Complaint has the relevant facts, I should extract those into the checklist. Each key fact should be a separate entry with evidence.\n\nI need to create multiple extracted entries for \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" based on the paragraphs. For example:\n- Vought named Acting Director on Feb 7, 2025 (para 26)\n- Vought instructed employees to \"stand down\" (para 30)\n- Requested $0 funding for Q3 2025 (para 31)\n- Mentioned $711M reserve (para 32)\n- Headquarters closure (para 35)\n- Trump's comments on CFPB (para 37-38)\n- Musk's social media posts (para 39)\n\nEach entry needs evidence with verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be the paragraph numbers or page numbers from the document. The document name is \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", and the location can reference the page numbers (e.g., Page 7-9).\n\nI should use `append_checklist` to add these entries. The patch must include the key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and an array of extracted values, each with evidence. Each evidence entry needs text, source_document, and location.\n\nWait, the previous error was because the patch was missing the \"key\" field. So I need to ensure the patch has \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and \"extracted\" as an array of entries.\n\nLet me structure the first few entries:\n\n1. Value: \"Russell Vought named Acting Director of CFPB on February 7, 2025\"\n   Evidence text: \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\"\n   Location: Page 7, para 26\n   Source: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n\n2. Value: \"Vought instructed CFPB employees to 'stand down' from work tasks on February 8, 2025\"\n   Evidence text: \"On February 8, the day after he became Acting Director, Vought instructed CFPB employees via an all-hands email to '[s]tand down from performing any work task.'\"\n   Location: Page 8, para 30\n   Source: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n\nAnd so on for the other facts.\n\nI need to make sure all the key factual points are covered. The next step is to append these entries using `append_checklist` with the correct structure. Since the document is fully visited, I don't need to read more, but I should verify that all relevant parts are covered. The Complaint's \"Factual Allegations\" section (paras 26-42) seems to have all the necessary details.\n\nI'll prepare the append_checklist call with multiple entries for the Factual_Basis_of_Case key. Each entry will have its own evidence. The previous error was due to missing \"key\", so I'll include it properly this time.\n\nAlso, check if there are other documents that might have more facts, but since the Complaint is the main pleading and it's fully read, and the other documents are unvisited, but the checklist item is about the factual basis which is primarily in the Complaint, it's safe to proceed with appending from the Complaint.\n\nSo the correct action is to use `append_checklist` with the extracted values from the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Russell Vought named Acting Director of CFPB on February 7, 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"On February 7, 2025, President Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the CFPB.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 7, Paragraph 26\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Vought instructed CFPB employees to 'stand down' from work tasks on February 8, 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"On February 8, the day after he became Acting Director, Vought instructed CFPB employees via an all-hands email to '[s]tand down from performing any work task.'\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 8, Paragraph 30\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Vought requested $0 funding for CFPB's third quarter of fiscal year 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"On February 8, the day after he became Acting Director, Vought notified the Board of Governors that, as Acting Director, he was requesting $0 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 8, Paragraph 31\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Vought claimed CFPB's $711,586,678 reserve fund was unnecessary and would be cut\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Vought's letter implied that the Bureau would be able to rely on a purported reserve balance of $711,586,678 to continue carrying out its authorities during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.
