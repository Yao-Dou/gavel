The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why there are no documents. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to see what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the right function to use here. It will return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet.

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where to look. The available documents are all unvisited, so I should start by reading one of them. The Docket document might have appeal information since dockets often list case proceedings, including appeals. The Complaint is the initial filing, so maybe less likely. The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) might mention appeals if it's an appellate court's opinion, but the name says \"Order/Opinion\", which could be a lower court's decision. The other documents are motions and notices, which might not mention appeals.\n\nThe Docket is 4,878 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. Let me check the document catalog again. All are unvisited, so reading the Docket makes sense. I'll use read_document on the Docket from start to end. The start_token is 0, end_token is 4878.\n\nWait, the user said \"read a targeted window (≤10,000 tokens)\", and the Docket is 4,878 tokens, so reading the whole document is okay. No need for regex here since the target isn't a specific pattern like a case number. Just need to scan the Docket for any mention of appeals.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Docket document. Let me make sure there's no other document more likely. The Memorandum is longer (23k tokens), but since it's an Order/Opinion, maybe it's the appellate court's opinion. But the Docket is more likely to have procedural info like appeals filed. Wait, the Docket usually lists filings, so if an appeal was filed, it would be in the Docket entries. The Memorandum might be the court's opinion, but if it's a lower court, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nBut the user's checklist is about appeals taken, so the Docket would have the entry for the appeal filing. So I'll go with reading the Docket first.

The user needs to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is defined as \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key is empty, and there are 7 documents. The Docket document has already been fully read (tokens 0-4878), and the other documents are unvisited. The Docket text provided in the recent actions doesn't mention any appeals. The Docket entries are mostly about filings, motions, orders, and dismissals, but no appeals are mentioned.\n\nThe next step is to check if any other documents might contain appeal information. The available documents include Complaint, Memorandum, Briefs, Notice of Dismissal, etc. Since the Docket is fully visited and doesn't have appeal info, I should look at other documents. The \"Appeal\" item likely refers to an appeal taken from a lower court to a higher court, but the case seems to be ongoing or dismissed without an appeal mentioned yet.\n\nThe Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (document 50 and 51) shows the case was dismissed, but that's not an appeal. The other documents like the Complaint, Briefs, and Motions are about the initial proceedings, not appeals. The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) might have more details, but the Docket doesn't indicate any appeal.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"Information about any appeals taken,\" so if there's no mention of an appeal in any document, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user's instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable just because it's not found; there needs to be explicit evidence. However, in the Docket, there's a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (entry 50) and the Marginal Order approving it (51). A voluntary dismissal without prejudice usually means the case is closed, and there's no appeal unless the parties decide to appeal the dismissal. But the Docket entries don't mention any appeal.\n\nSince the Docket is fully read and no appeal is mentioned, and the other documents (which are unvisited) are about the case's initial stages (complaint, motions for TRO, etc.), it's possible that there's no appeal in this case. However, the system requires explicit evidence for Not Applicable. The user's instructions say that if the case is dismissed without prejudice, that might not require an appeal. But the Not Applicable encoding needs to be set via update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" as the value.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Appeal: Information about any appeals taken...\" So if there's no appeal, then the value should be Not Applicable. But the system says to require explicit text or dispositive evidence. The dismissal without prejudice (entry 50) might imply that there's no appeal because the case was voluntarily dismissed. However, the instructions say that \"dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree\" but here it's without prejudice. Wait, the Notice says \"Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice,\" so the parties could refile, but that doesn't mean there's an appeal. The absence of any mention of an appeal in all documents suggests that no appeal was taken.\n\nBut the system says not to mark as Not Applicable just because it's not found. So maybe I need to check the other documents to be sure. However, the other documents are unvisited. The next logical step is to read one of the other documents to confirm. But which one? The Complaint might not have appeal info, but the Memorandum (Order/Opinion) could have a court opinion that mentions an appeal. Wait, but the case seems to be in the District Court, and the documents are all from the District Court. An appeal would typically be to a Circuit Court, but if the case was dismissed before a final judgment, there might not be an appeal.\n\nWait, the case was dismissed on June 12, 2025 (entry 51). If the dismissal is final, maybe an appeal could be filed, but the Docket doesn't mention any appeal filings. The user's task is to extract from the provided documents. Since the Docket is fully read and shows no appeal, and the other documents are unvisited but are part of the same case (complaint, motions, etc.), it's possible that there's no appeal. However, to be thorough, maybe I should check the Memorandum document (Order/Opinion) which is 23k tokens. But the user's instructions say to avoid rereading visited documents, but this one is unvisited.\n\nWait, the current available documents list shows Docket as fully visited, others as unvisited. So the next step is to read one of the unvisited documents. But which one? The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) is the most likely to have a court opinion that might mention an appeal. But since the case was dismissed, maybe the opinion explains why there's no appeal. Alternatively, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might be the key. Wait, the Notice (document 5) is \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" which is a pleading. Maybe that document explicitly states that there's no appeal.\n\nBut the user hasn't read that document yet. The Docket shows entry 50 is the Notice, but the actual document (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice) hasn't been read. So perhaps the document itself says something about no appeal.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" document to check for any mention of an appeal. If it says \"no appeal is being taken\" or similar, then we can set Not Applicable. Otherwise, if it's silent, we might need to check other documents.\n\nBut the checklist requires evidence. Since the Docket doesn't mention an appeal, and the Notice of Dismissal might be the only place where it's discussed, it's better to read that document. So the next step is to call read_document on \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" from tokens 0-1199 (since it's 1199 tokens, which is under 10k). Wait, the document is listed as 1,199 tokens, so reading all of it would be safe.\n\nWait, the available documents list says \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 1,199 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". So the next action should be to read that document. The user should call read_document with doc_name \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" and start_token 0, end_token 1199.\n\nBut before that, check if any other document is more relevant. The \"Appeal\" checklist item probably refers to an appeal from this case, so if the case was dismissed, and the dismissal is without prejudice, there's no appeal. But the document might explicitly state that. So reading the Notice document is the best next step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1199}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1199}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8472, "completion_tokens": 1555, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The user provided the recent actions, and I need to figure out what to do next.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: the \"Appeal\" key is empty. The available documents include some fully visited ones (Docket and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal) and others unvisited. The Docket and the Notice document have been read completely, but neither mentions an appeal. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal says the case was dismissed without prejudice, but there's no mention of an appeal.\n\nThe checklist item is about \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court.\" The format should be 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nI need to check if any of the unvisited documents might contain appeal information. The unvisited documents are Complaint, Memorandum, Amicus Brief, Plaintiff's Memorandum, and Plaintiffs' Motion. The Memorandum is an Order/Opinion with 23k tokens, which might contain court decisions, possibly including appeals. The Amicus Brief and other briefs might reference appeals, but the Complaint is the initial filing, which probably doesn't have appeals yet.\n\nThe previous steps read the Docket (which is a log of filings) and the Notice of Dismissal. The Docket entries go up to the dismissal, and the Notice says it's dismissed without prejudice, so maybe there's no appeal yet. But I need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the user's step 3 read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice, which is document 50. The dismissal is without prejudice, so the case was closed, but maybe there's an appeal mentioned elsewhere. However, the Notice itself doesn't mention an appeal. The Docket entries don't show any appeals either—they have motions, orders, but no appeals.\n\nThe next logical step is to check the other unvisited documents. The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) is a 23k token document, which might be a court opinion. If there's an appeal, it might be mentioned there. The other briefs might also reference appeals, but the Memorandum is the most likely place.\n\nSince the user needs to extract \"Appeal\" and it's empty, I should read the Memorandum document. The current state shows it's unvisited, so I should use read_document on that. The Memorandum is 23k tokens, but the maximum per read is 10k, so I need to split it into chunks. But the first read would be tokens 0-10000. However, the tool parameters require start and end tokens. The document is unvisited, so I'll start from 0 to 10000.\n\nWait, the available documents list says \"Memorandum [Order/Opinion] - 23,031 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". So I should call read_document on \"Memorandum\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nI should not use search_document_regex yet because there's no clear pattern like \"Appeal\" in the text, but since the checklist item is \"Appeal\", maybe the document mentions it. But the user's instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. However, the target here is a specific term, so maybe a regex search for \"appeal\" could help. But the current step is to read the document, as the unvisited document is the most likely source.\n\nWait, the previous actions read two documents (Docket and Notice), which didn't have the appeal info. The next step should be to read another document. Since the Memorandum is the largest and most likely to have court opinions (which might mention appeals), it's the best candidate. So the next action is read_document on Memorandum, tokens 0-10000.\n\nI need to make sure not to read the same document multiple times. The Memorandum is unvisited, so it's okay to read it. The other documents are also unvisited, but the Memorandum is the most relevant for an appeal mention.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document with doc_name \"Memorandum\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9812, "completion_tokens": 951, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is supposed to be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I should check the current status. The snapshot shows that the \"Appeal\" key is empty, and there are 7 documents. The Docket and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice are fully visited, but the Memorandum is partially visited (only 0-10000 tokens read). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they read the Docket (tokens 0-4878), the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (0-1199), and the Memorandum (0-10000). The Memorandum is part of the case documents, but the current read only went up to token 10000 out of 23031. The key is to find any mentions of appeals.\n\nIn the Docket, I see entries like \"MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"ORDER granting 17 Joint MOTION Set Briefing Schedule,\" but no mention of an appeal. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal says \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice,\" which is a dismissal, not an appeal. The Memorandum (Document 45) is a court memorandum discussing the case, but it's about a motion for preliminary injunction, not an appeal. The case was dismissed voluntarily (Document 50), but that's not an appeal.\n\nWait, the checklist is about \"Appeals taken,\" meaning if the case was appealed to a higher court. But in the documents provided, the case is being dismissed by the plaintiffs (voluntary dismissal without prejudice), so there's no appeal mentioned. The case hasn't gone to an appellate court yet; it's still in the district court. The Memorandum mentions the court (District of Maryland), but no appeal to a higher court.\n\nThe user's checklist item says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" Since the case was dismissed by the plaintiffs, there's no appeal. But I need to check if any document mentions an appeal. Let me scan the Memorandum text again. The Memorandum (Document 45) is a court order denying the motion for preliminary injunction, and the case was later dismissed voluntarily. There's no mention of an appeal to a higher court. The documents provided are all from the district court level, and the dismissal was without prejudice, so the case could be refiled, but there's no appeal.\n\nThe key point here is that the case hasn't been appealed. The checklist item is about \"any appeals taken,\" so if there are no appeals, the key should be marked as Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable Encoding rules, I need to set it via update_checklist with the value \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence.\n\nThe user's instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" In this case, the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice (Document 50), which means the plaintiffs dropped the case, so there's no appeal. The dismissal without prejudice implies that the case could be refiled, but there's no appeal to a higher court. The documents don't mention any appeal, and the case was dismissed at the district court level. So the evidence for Not Applicable is the voluntary dismissal without prejudice, which means the case didn't proceed to an appeal.\n\nWait, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (Document 50) says \"Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice,\" and the court approved it (Document 51). So the case ended at the district court level without any appeal. Therefore, there's no appeal taken, so the \"Appeal\" key should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nThe user's checklist requires that if it's Not Applicable, it's set via update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" as the value. So I need to use update_checklist for the \"Appeal\" key, with evidence from the dismissal documents.\n\nCheck the documents: Document 50 (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal) states \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice.\" Document 51 is the court's approval. So the evidence is that the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning no appeal was taken.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to update the checklist for \"Appeal\" to Not Applicable, with evidence from the dismissal notice.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm not missing any other documents. The other documents (Complaint, Amicus Brief, etc.) are unvisited, but since the case was dismissed, there's no need to check them for appeals. The key point is that the case was voluntarily dismissed, so no appeal occurred. So the evidence is in the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and the MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING the dismissal.\n\nSo the next action should be update_checklist with the Appeal key set to \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from Document 50 (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice) and Document 51 (MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Plaintiffs Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and Economic Action Maryland Fund hereby give notice that the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice against Defendants Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Russell Vought.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1, Paragraph 1\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Entry 51\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "Plaintiffs Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and Economic Action Maryland Fund hereby give notice that the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice against Defendants Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Russell Vought.", "source_document": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "location": "Page 1, Paragraph 1"}, {"text": "MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Entry 51"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 20245, "completion_tokens": 1316, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist definition says to extract information about any appeals taken, including parties and appellate court, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already done several steps. The last action was an `update_checklist` for \"Appeal\" with a value of \"Not Applicable\" based on the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice and the Docket entry 51. The evidence given is that the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, so there's no appeal taken.\n\nNow, checking the current status: the \"Appeal\" key is marked as Not Applicable with 1 extracted entry. The system says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Not Applicable: 1/1\", and \"Total Values Extracted: 1\". The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Amicus Brief, etc., but the checklist item is already marked as Not Applicable.\n\nThe Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key (\"Appeal\") and it's already set to Not Applicable with proper evidence, there's nothing left to do. The evidence provided (the dismissal notice and the marginal order) supports that there's no appeal because the case was dismissed without prejudice, so no appeal would be filed. \n\nThe user mentioned that Not Applicable must have explicit evidence, and here they have two pieces: the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal stating it's dismissed without prejudice, and the order approving that dismissal. So the evidence is solid. \n\nNo other documents need to be checked for \"Appeal\" because the key is already resolved. The other documents (like the Complaint or Amicus Brief) are about the case's progression but don't mention any appeal since the case was dismissed.

The evidence shows:\n- The case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice (from the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal)\n- The Docket entry confirms approval of this dismissal\n\nThe legal principle here is that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice doesn't create an appealable order - the plaintiff can refile the case. Therefore, there's no appeal to extract, making \"Not Applicable\" the correct status.\n\nThe system's automatic review after Step 6 confirms the checklist is complete. The extraction progress shows:\n- All keys are resolved (Appeal is Not Applicable)\n- No empty keys\n- No need to read more documents since the \"Appeal\" item is already properly marked\n\nI should verify if there's any possibility of missing an appeal mention elsewhere, but the evidence provided is:\n1.
