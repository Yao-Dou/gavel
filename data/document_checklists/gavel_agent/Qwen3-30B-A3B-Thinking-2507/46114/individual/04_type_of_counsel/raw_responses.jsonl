The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the documents. The checklist says to get the type of counsel for each side, like Plaintiff: private counsel (ABC Law Firm), Defendant: government counsel, etc. If a side doesn't have clear counsel info, skip it.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents. All are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The user has already done list_documents and found 7 docs. The current status shows Type_of_Counsel is empty. So I need to start reading documents.\n\nWhich document should I read first? The Complaint might have the initial counsel info. The Docket could list attorneys. The Memorandum or Briefs might mention counsel. But the Complaint is the first document, so it's a good starting point.\n\nThe Complaint is 6,497 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing with read_document. But maybe the counsel is in the beginning. Let's check the document's structure. Typically, the Complaint starts with parties and their counsel.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Complaint document. Let's call read_document with doc_name \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", start_token 0, end_token 6497. That's the whole document. Wait, the tokens are 6,497, so end_token should be 6497 (since it's exclusive). But the maximum per call is 10k, so 6497 is fine.\n\nWait, the document's token count is 6,497, so start 0, end 6497. That's safe. No need to split. Let me confirm: the parameters require start and end. So I'll set start_token=0, end_token=6497.\n\nI should make sure not to read a partial document if it's unvisited. Since it's unvisited, reading the whole thing is okay. The next step after reading would be to check the text for Type_of_Counsel entries and then append them.

The user is asking to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and the only document read so far is the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, which is fully visited.\n\nLooking at the Complaint document, I need to find who is representing the plaintiffs and defendants. The complaint lists the plaintiffs as \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore\" and \"Economic Action Maryland Fund\". The defendants are \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" and \"Russell Vought\" in his official capacity.\n\nNow, the counsel for the plaintiffs is listed at the end: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" followed by the names and law firm. The attorneys are from \"Democracy Forward Foundation\". The firm name is mentioned, so the type of counsel here would be a public interest nonprofit, since Democracy Forward is a nonprofit focused on public interest law.\n\nThe defendants are the CFPB and Russell Vought. The complaint doesn't mention the defendants' counsel, so we can't determine their type of counsel from this document. The task says to extract only when the type is clear, so since defendants' counsel isn't specified here, we shouldn't include them.\n\nSo the only clear value from this document is the plaintiffs' counsel as a public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation). The evidence is the list of attorneys from that firm under \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\".\n\nI need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The key is Type_of_Counsel, value is \"Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", with evidence including the verbatim text, source document, and location (page 15).\n\nWait, the document is the Complaint, and the counsel is on page 15. The text shows \"/s/ Mark B. Samburg\" and the firm name. So the evidence should reference that part.\n\nCheck the checklist requirements: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as separate values\". Here, only plaintiffs' counsel is mentioned, defendants' isn't, so only one entry for plaintiffs.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" for the plaintiffs. The key is Type_of_Counsel, and the value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: ...' but the example given in the checklist says \"Plaintiff: …\" so maybe I need to include \"Plaintiff: \" in the value. Wait, the checklist definition says: \"extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\".\n\nWait, looking back: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" So for this case, since only plaintiffs' counsel is listed, the entry should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nWait, but the example given in the checklist says \"Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\" so maybe the \"Plaintiff: \" is part of the value. So the value should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nWait, the checklist item says: \"the type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels... and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nSo for each side that has counsel listed, we add a value like \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nIn this case, only plaintiffs' counsel is listed, so the value should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text. The relevant part is the \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" line and the law firm name.\n\nLooking at the document, on page 15, it says:\n\n\"Counsel for Plaintiffs\n\nMark B. Samburg\nKevin E. Friedl* \n... (other names)\nDemocracy Forward Foundation\"\n\nSo the verbatim text for evidence is the line \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" under Counsel for Plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the evidence needs to have the text snippet. So the text would be \"Democracy Forward Foundation\", source document is \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location is \"Page 15\" or \"tokens 6300-6497\" (since it's the end of the document). But the user's snapshot shows the document is fully visited, tokens 0-6497, so location could be \"Page 15\" as per the document's pagination.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have text: \"Democracy Forward Foundation\", source_document: \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location: \"Page 15\".\n\nThe value is \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nSo, append_checklist with key \"Type_of_Counsel\", extracted list containing that single entry with the evidence.\n\nCheck if the value is correctly formatted. The example given in the checklist uses \"Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\", so here it's \"Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", prefixed with \"Plaintiff: \".\n\nYes, so the value should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nNow, the action should be append_checklist. The other documents haven't been read yet, but the current step is to extract from the documents read. Since the complaint is fully read, and we found the value here, we should append it.\n\nNo need to use update_checklist because we're adding a new entry, not replacing. Also, the key was empty, so appending is correct.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the patch containing Type_of_Counsel and the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Democracy Forward Foundation\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 15\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)", "evidence": [{"text": "Democracy Forward Foundation", "source_document": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "location": "Page 15"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10471, "completion_tokens": 1329, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Wait, no. The checklist item is \"Type_of_Counsel\", and they need to extract all distinct values. The current extraction has one entry for the plaintiff. But the defendants might have their own counsel, so I need to check if the defendants' counsel is mentioned anywhere.\n\nLooking at the available documents: the Complaint is fully visited (✓), but the Docket and other documents are unvisited. The Docket might have information about the defendants' counsel. The Complaint lists the defendants as CFPB and Russell Vought, but the counsel for defendants isn't mentioned there. The Docket could have the defendant's attorney details.\n\nSo, the next step should be to read the Docket document to check for defendant's counsel. The Docket is listed as [Docket] with 4,878 tokens, unvisited. Since the Complaint is fully visited, the next logical step is to read the Docket to see if it mentions the defendant's counsel.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" The current entry is for the plaintiff. The defendants are CFPB and Vought, but they might be represented by government counsel. The Docket might list the defendants' attorneys.\n\nSo, the correct action is to read the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited, so I should call read_document on Docket, starting from 0-4878 tokens (since it's unvisited, read the whole document). But wait, the document is 4,878 tokens, so start_token 0, end_token 4878.\n\nWait, the tool's read_document requires start_token and end_token. Since it's unvisited, read the whole thing. So the parameters would be doc_name: \"Docket\", start_token: 0, end_token: 4878.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search_document_regex for \"Counsel\" or \"Attorney\" to find where the counsel is mentioned. But since the Docket is a document that likely lists counsel, reading it directly might be more efficient.\n\nThe decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document (default) or search_document_regex.\" Since the Docket is the most likely place for defendant's counsel, using read_document on Docket is the right move.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Docket document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4878}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4878}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10578, "completion_tokens": 643, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. So far, they've already read the Complaint and Docket documents. From the Complaint, they found that the plaintiff's counsel is \"Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nNow, looking at the current status, they have one value extracted. The next step is to check if there are more values in the remaining documents. The available documents that haven't been fully visited are:\n\n- Memorandum (Order/Opinion) - 23k tokens\n- Brief of Amicus Curiae - 11k tokens\n- Notice of Voluntary Dismissal - 1.2k tokens\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum - 8.3k tokens\n- Plaintiffs' Motion - 706 tokens\n\nThe Docket document was fully read, and the Complaint was fully read. The Docket mentions some attorneys appearing pro hac vice, but the checklist requires the type of counsel, not the attorneys' names. The key point is whether there's a mention of the type of counsel for the defendants.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 16 says \"NOTICE of Appearance by Brad P Rosenberg on behalf of All Defendants\" and later entries mention Andrea William Trento and Liam Holland on behalf of Defendants. But \"on behalf of All Defendants\" doesn't specify the type of counsel. However, the defendants are the CFPB and Russell Vought. The CFPB is a government agency, so their counsel would likely be government counsel.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\"\n\nSo for the defendants (CFPB and Vought), since they're a government agency, the counsel should be \"government counsel\". But the Docket entries don't explicitly state \"government counsel\", they just list the attorneys. However, the CFPB is a federal agency, so their representation would be government counsel. But the document might not have that stated explicitly. Let's check the Docket again.\n\nLooking at the Docket, entry 16: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Brad P Rosenberg on behalf of All Defendants\". The defendants are Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Russell Vought (acting Director). CFPB is a federal agency, so their counsel would be government counsel. But the Docket entry doesn't say \"government counsel\", just the attorney's name. So maybe the type of counsel for defendants isn't explicitly stated in the Docket. The Complaint's plaintiff counsel was explicitly stated as \"Democracy Forward Foundation\", which is a public interest nonprofit.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is for the plaintiff. The checklist says \"if both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\".\n\nSo the plaintiff's counsel is \"Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", and the defendant's counsel might be government counsel. But do we have evidence for that?\n\nThe Docket has entries where the defendants' attorneys are listed, but the type isn't specified. However, since the defendants are a government agency (CFPB), it's reasonable to infer that their counsel is government counsel. But the instructions say: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\"\n\nThe problem is, the documents don't explicitly state \"government counsel\" for the defendants. The Docket just lists the attorneys. So maybe we can't confirm the defendant's counsel type. The user's previous step only extracted the plaintiff's counsel.\n\nBut let's check the other documents. The \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might have more info, but it's an amicus brief, so it's not the main parties. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is by the plaintiffs, so that's not relevant for counsel type. The Plaintiff's Memorandum and Motion are from the plaintiffs, so they might mention their counsel again, but they already have the plaintiff's counsel from the Complaint.\n\nWait, the Complaint's signature page lists \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" as counsel for plaintiffs. The Docket entries for the defendants' attorneys don't specify the type. So maybe there's no explicit mention of the defendant's counsel type. Therefore, we can't extract a value for defendant's counsel because it's not clear from the documents.\n\nBut wait, the CFPB is a federal agency, so their counsel would be government counsel. But the instructions say \"if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents\". Since the document doesn't say \"government counsel\", maybe we shouldn't assume. The example given in the checklist includes \"government counsel\" as a category, but the document must state it or make it clear.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 18: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Beatrice C. Thomas on behalf of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\". The CFPB is a federal agency, so their counsel is government counsel. But the document doesn't label it as such. However, in legal contexts, when a government agency is a party, their counsel is typically government counsel. So maybe it's clear enough.\n\nBut the instructions say \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So if the document doesn't explicitly state \"government counsel\", but it's a government agency, is that clear enough? The user's previous step only extracted the plaintiff's counsel. The defendant's counsel type might not have been extracted yet.\n\nWait, the current checklist item \"Type_of_Counsel\" has one value: \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". But the defendant's counsel should also be extracted as \"Defendant: Government counsel\" if clear.\n\nSo, to get the defendant's counsel, we need to confirm if it's clear. Since the defendants are the CFPB (a federal agency), their counsel is government counsel. But does the document state that? The Docket doesn't say \"government counsel\", but it's implied. However, the user's task is to extract from the documents, so maybe the document must explicitly state it. But the example given includes \"government counsel\" as a category, so if the defendant is a government agency, it's considered government counsel.\n\nLooking at the Complaint, the defendants are listed as \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" and \"Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director...\". So the CFPB is a federal agency, so their counsel would be government counsel. The Docket's entry 16 mentions \"Brad P Rosenberg on behalf of All Defendants\", but doesn't specify the type. However, the fact that it's a federal agency makes it clear.\n\nBut the user's previous step didn't extract the defendant's counsel. So maybe they need to extract \"Defendant: Government counsel\" based on the defendants being a government agency.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is only for the plaintiff. The checklist requires both sides if applicable. So the next step is to check if the defendant's counsel type is present in the documents.\n\nThe Docket has entries for the defendants' attorneys, but no explicit type. The Complaint's parties section says \"Defendants. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ... and Russell Vought...\". The CFPB is a government agency, so their counsel is government counsel. The document doesn't say \"government counsel\", but it's a standard classification. However, the instructions say \"if the type of counsel is not clear\", so we need to see if it's clear.\n\nGiven that the CFPB is a federal agency, and the attorney is appearing on behalf of them, it's clear that the counsel is government counsel. So the defendant's counsel type should be \"Government counsel\".\n\nBut where's the evidence? The document doesn't state \"government counsel\", but the context implies it. However, the evidence requirement is to have a verbatim snippet. The document might not have the exact phrase, but the context makes it clear.\n\nWait, the user's previous step extracted the plaintiff's counsel from the Complaint's signature. For the defendant, the Docket might have a notice of appearance that implies it. For example, \"NOTICE of Appearance by Brad P Rosenberg on behalf of All Defendants (Rosenberg, Brad)\" but that's the attorney's name, not the type.\n\nWait, the checklist example says \"government counsel\" as a category. So if the defendant is a government agency, it's government counsel. The document doesn't need to say \"government counsel\", because the type is determined by the party. So the evidence would be the fact that the defendant is a government agency (CFPB), so their counsel is government counsel.\n\nBut the evidence must include a verbatim text. So the verbatim text could be the mention of \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" as a defendant, which is a federal agency.\n\nSo the evidence for Defendant: Government counsel would be the line in the Complaint: \"Defendants. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW Washington, DC 20552, and Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau...\"\n\nSo the defendants include the CFPB, a federal agency, so their counsel is government counsel.\n\nTherefore, we need to add \"Defendant: Government counsel\" to the Type_of_Counsel.\n\nBut the current status shows that the Checklist Summary has 1 value extracted (only plaintiff). So the next action should be to extract the defendant's counsel.\n\nBut the Docket was fully read, and the Complaint was fully read. The evidence for defendant's counsel is in the Complaint, which was already read. So why wasn't it extracted before?\n\nWait, in Step 3, they used append_checklist with the value from the Complaint's signature page. The Complaint's parties section mentions the defendants as CFPB, but the counsel type wasn't extracted there. The counsel type for the defendants would be inferred from the party type (government agency), but the signature page only lists the plaintiff's counsel.\n\nSo the user might have missed the defendant's counsel. Now, since the Complaint was fully read, they can extract the defendant's counsel from the Complaint's parties section.\n\nWait, the Complaint's parties section says:\n\n\"Defendants. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW Washington, DC 20552, and Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 725 17th St NW Washington, D.C. 20503,\"\n\nSo the defendants are a federal agency (CFPB) and an individual in official capacity. The CFPB is a government agency, so their counsel is government counsel. The individual (Vought) is acting in his official capacity, so the government is representing him. Therefore, the defendant's counsel is government counsel.\n\nSo the evidence for Defendant: Government counsel is the mention of the CFPB as a defendant, which is a federal agency.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to append the defendant's counsel value.\n\nBut the current status shows that the Checklist Summary has 1 value extracted (plaintiff). So the user needs to append the defendant's value.\n\nHowever, the user needs to check if there's any other document that might have more information. But the Complaint already has the parties listed, so the evidence is there.\n\nWait, the user's previous action (Step 3) appended only the plaintiff's counsel. They need to now append the defendant's counsel.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the new value.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\"\n\nSince the Complaint was fully read, and the user is now processing it, they should have extracted both plaintiff and defendant counsel from the Complaint. But they only extracted the plaintiff's. So they missed the defendant's.\n\nNow, they need to append the defendant's counsel.\n\nThe evidence for Defendant: Government counsel would be the line from the Complaint where the defendants are listed as the CFPB (a federal agency).\n\nSo the evidence text would be \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" from the Complaint.\n\nThe location would be \"Page 1, Parties section\" or similar.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the new value.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions (Step 4) read the Docket, which didn't add anything new. The Docket entries for defendants' attorneys don't specify the type, but the Complaint's parties section does.\n\nSo the missing value is for the defendant. The user should append it now.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call append_checklist with the new value.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Defendant: Government counsel\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW Washington, DC 20552\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1, Parties section\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Defendant: Government counsel", "evidence": [{"text": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW Washington, DC 20552", "source_document": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "location": "Page 1, Parties section"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15623, "completion_tokens": 2796, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist has two values, and both are filled.

So far, they have two entries. But maybe the Amicus Brief or other documents mention other counsel types. However, the Defendants are already covered as Government counsel. The Amicus Curiae (States of New York, etc.) are supporting the Plaintiffs, but they're amici, not the main parties. The main parties are Plaintiffs (Baltimore and Economic Action) and Defendants (CFPB and Vought). The Plaintiffs' counsel is Democracy Forward Foundation, a public interest nonprofit. The Defendants' counsel is government, since CFPB is a federal agency.\n\nWait, in the Docket, there's a Notice of Appearance by Brad P Rosenberg on behalf of All Defendants (Step 16), and later Andrea William Trento, Liam Holland, Abigail Stout. But the Defendants are the CFPB and Vought, so their counsel would be government counsel. The fact that they have attorneys like Holland and Stout might be government attorneys, so it's still Government counsel.\n\nThe user's previous entries are:\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\n- Defendant: Government counsel\n\nNow, checking the other documents: the Amicus Brief's title mentions \"States of New York and New Jersey... in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion\".

So the amici's counsel isn't relevant here.\n\nThe other documents like the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Motion for TRO, etc., probably don't add new counsel types. The Plaintiffs' counsel is already identified as Democracy Forward, and the Defendants as Government.\n\nWait, in the Docket, the Defendants' counsel is listed as Brad P Rosenberg, Andrea William Trento, Liam Holland, Abigail Stout. But since the Defendants are a government agency, their counsel is government counsel. The attorneys are likely government attorneys (e.g., from DOJ), so the type is still Government counsel.\n\nSo, no new values to extract. The checklist for Type_of_Counsel has two entries, both filled. The other documents are unvisited, but they probably don't contain additional counsel types for the main parties. The Amicus Brief might have the states' counsel, but again, not part of the main parties.\n\nTherefore, all applicable checklist items are extracted. The next step is to confirm with get_checklist to ensure there are no gaps, but since the user has two entries and the rest of the documents are likely not adding more, they can stop.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", which is correct since there's only one checklist item (Type_of_Counsel). The two values are already appended. So, all values are extracted. The next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions already appended two values. The checklist summary shows 2 values extracted. The documents left are unvisited, but the checklist item is already complete. There's no need to read more documents because the question is about the main parties' counsel, which has been covered.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All applicable Type_of_Counsel values extracted: Plaintiff (Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)) and Defendant (Government counsel).

{"step": 8, "run_id": "128055a7-7f31-4377-a9ad-365ddf9608e2", "timestamp": "2025-11-16T02:52:18.276306-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user is trying to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. So far, they've done steps 1-7. The current status shows that Type_of_Counsel has two values: Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation) and Defendant: Government counsel. Both were extracted from the Complaint and Docket documents, which are marked as fully visited.\n\nThe available documents list shows that there are 7 documents total. The Complaint and Docket are fully visited (✓), but the other five are unvisited (○). However, the checklist item Type_of_Counsel has already been filled with two values. The system's current status says 1/1 keys filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. \n\nWait, the user's step 6 was a stop, but the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" and asks for another decision. The automatic checklist review after the first stop shows that all keys are filled. The two values are from the Complaint and Docket, which have been fully read. The other documents are unvisited, but do they contain more Type_of_Counsel information?\n\nLooking at the checklist definition: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The current extraction has two values. But maybe the unvisited documents have more. However, the documents listed as unvisited are things like Memorandum, Amicus Brief, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, etc. The Type_of_Counsel is about the type of counsel for each side. The Complaint mentions the Plaintiff's counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation) and the Defendant's parties (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is a government agency, hence Government counsel). The Docket entries show the Defendant's counsel (like Brad P Rosenberg, Beatrice C. Thomas, etc.), but those are attorneys appearing for the Defendant, not the type of counsel. The Defendant is the government (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), so their counsel would be government counsel, which was already noted.\n\nWait, in Step 5, the evidence for Defendant: Government counsel was from the Complaint's Parties section, which lists \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" as a Defendant. The CFPB is a government agency, so that's correct. The Docket entries mention attorneys appearing for the Defendants (like Rosenberg, Thomas), but the type of counsel is Government counsel because the Defendant is a government entity, not that the attorneys are government lawyers. Wait, but the checklist says \"the type of counsel representing each side\". So the Defendant side is represented by government counsel (since the Defendant is a government agency), not the specific attorneys. The attorneys appearing pro hac vice (like Friedl, McGrath) are private attorneys representing the government, but the type is still Government counsel. So the Type_of_Counsel for Defendant is Government counsel, which was already captured.\n\nThe other documents: the Amicus Brief is from states, so they're amici, not parties. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is from the Plaintiff's side, but doesn't mention counsel type. The Memorandum and other briefs are from the Plaintiff's side, but the counsel type was already established as Public interest nonprofit. So probably no additional Type_of_Counsel values in the unvisited documents.\n\nThe system's current checklist status shows 2 values, and the user's step 6 called stop. But the system says it's stop attempt 1/2. The user needs to confirm if there are any more values to extract. Since all documents have been checked (Complaint and Docket fully visited, and other documents don't seem relevant for Type_of_Counsel), the extraction is complete. The other documents might not have any more information about the counsel types. For example, the Amicus Brief is filed by states, but they're amici, not parties, so their counsel type isn't part of the main case's Type_of_Counsel. The checklist says \"for each side\" (Plaintiff and Defendant), so only the main parties' counsel types matter.\n\nTherefore, all applicable values are extracted. The user should call stop again. The system allows two stop attempts, and this is the second one. So the next action should be to stop with the reason that all values are extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All Type_of_Counsel values extracted: Plaintiff (Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)) from Complaint, Defendant (Government counsel) from Complaint/Docket.
