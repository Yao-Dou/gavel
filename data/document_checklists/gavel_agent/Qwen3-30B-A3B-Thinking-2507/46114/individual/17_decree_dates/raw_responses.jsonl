The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there's no documents listed, I can't proceed with reading or searching. So the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The tools mention that if the catalog is unknown, use list_documents. The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so definitely need to list them first.

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and it's currently empty. There are 7 unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain decree dates. The \"Memorandum\" (Order/Opinion) is probably the key document here since it's a court order or opinion that would include dates related to decrees. The Docket might also have dates, but the Memorandum is more likely to have the actual decree details.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Memorandum is 23k tokens, which is the largest. But I can't read the whole thing at once; max 10k tokens per read. So I need to read a portion. Since the Memorandum is a court order, the decree dates are probably in the main body, maybe near the beginning where the order is stated.\n\nI should use read_document to get a chunk of the Memorandum. Let's start from the beginning. The document is unvisited, so I'll read tokens 0-10,000. That's a safe start. The Docket might have dates too, but the Memorandum seems the highest priority. The other documents like Complaint or Motions might mention dates but not the decree dates themselves. The Notice of Dismissal might have dates, but it's a dismissal, not a decree.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on the Memorandum from 0 to 10,000 tokens. That's the most efficient first step to find any decree dates.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3523, "completion_tokens": 378, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", which includes entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments. They want each date as a separate value formatted as '[date]: [decree event]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, the only document partially read is the Memorandum (tokens 0-10000), and the rest are unvisited. The user has already read the first 10k tokens of the Memorandum. Now, I need to check if any decree dates are mentioned there.\n\nScanning through the provided text from the Memorandum: The document is a court memorandum discussing a case about the CFPB's funding. It mentions various dates like February 7, 2025 (Vought's appointment), February 8 (letter to Powell), February 10-14 (headquarters closure), February 11 (Executive Order), February 12 (Complaint filed), February 13 (stipulation), February 26 (hearing), March 14 (document filed), etc. But none of these are decree dates. The case is about a motion for preliminary injunction, not a final decree. The court hasn't entered a decree yet; it's still in the motion phase. The Memorandum says the motion is pending, and the hearing was on February 26, 2025. The document itself is filed on March 14, 2025, but that's the filing date of the memorandum, not a decree.\n\nSo, in the Memorandum, there's no decree date. The user needs to check other documents. The next step is to read another document. The available documents include the Complaint, Docket, and others. The Docket might have dates related to court orders. But since the Memorandum didn't have any decree dates, I should move to another document.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Do not include dates for non-decree items (e.g., private settlements not entered as orders).\" So the key is to find actual court-ordered decrees. The Memorandum is a court opinion, but it's not a decree. The motion for preliminary injunction is still pending, so no decree has been entered yet. Therefore, the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" might be empty, but the user has to confirm by checking all documents.\n\nThe next action should be to read another document. The Docket might list entry dates of orders. The Docket document is unvisited, so I should read it. The Docket is 4,878 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. Let me choose to read the Docket document from tokens 0-4878.\n\nWait, the current state says the Memorandum is partially visited (0-10k), and others are unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Docket. The Docket would likely contain dates of court entries, which might include decree dates. So I'll call read_document on the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 4878.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4878}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4878}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13957, "completion_tokens": 718, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", which includes entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The task says there are 0 values extracted out of 1 key. The documents available include Docket (fully visited), Memorandum (partially visited), and others unvisited. The Docket is fully read, so I should check if any decree dates are in there.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, I see entries like \"ORDER granting 8 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File... denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order\". The key dates here are the \"Entered\" dates. For example, entry 45 says \"2025-03-14 | MEMORANDUM. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 3/14/2025.\" Entry 46 is \"2025-03-14 | ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File... denying 8 Motion... Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 3/14/2025.\" Also, entry 38 has a date: \"2025-02-28 | ORDER Extending... Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 2/28/2025.\"\n\nWait, the checklist specifies \"decree-related dates\", including entry dates of orders. The Memorandum (which is the court's opinion) was filed on 03/14/25, and the Order denying the TRO was signed on the same day. The Docket shows the order was entered on 03/14/25. Also, the temporary restraining order was extended until 03/14/25 (entry 38), which was signed on 02/28/25. But the key is the date the decree (the order) was entered.\n\nWait, the user needs to extract the decree dates. The Memorandum itself is the court's opinion, and the order denying the TRO (which is a decree) was signed on 03/14/25. So the entry date for the order is 03/14/2025. Also, entry 38 has the order extending the TRO until 03/14/25, signed on 02/28/25. But the actual decree (the order denying the motion) is on 03/14/25.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 46 says \"ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 3/14/2025.\" So the decree date here is 2025-03-14.\n\nAlso, entry 38 is an order extending the TRO until 03/14/25, but that's a temporary order, not the final decree. The final decree is the denial on 03/14/25.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"entry dates\" of the order. So the order denying the motion (which is a decree) was entered on 03/14/25. The Memorandum (entry 45) was filed on the same date, but the order is separate. The order is entry 46, signed on 03/14/25.\n\nSo the decree date is 03/14/2025. The event is \"denying motion for temporary restraining order, construed as preliminary injunction.\"\n\nNow, are there other dates? The Docket shows entry 38 was signed on 02/28/25, extending the TRO until 03/14/25. But the TRO itself was granted earlier. Entry 24 says \"ORDER Directing Case to be Reassigned...\" but that's not a decree. The key is the final order denying the motion, which is on 03/14/25.\n\nSo the only decree date here is 2025-03-14 for the order denying the motion. The Memorandum (document) also mentions the hearing on 02/26/25, but that's the hearing date, not the decree date.\n\nWait, the Memorandum itself (the court's opinion) is dated 03/14/25. The order denying the motion is separate but same date. So the decree date is 03/14/2025.\n\nNow, check if there are other documents. The Memorandum (partially visited) has text. The first part of the Memorandum mentions the hearing on February 26, 2025 (page 2), but that's the hearing, not the decree. The decree is the order filed on 03/14/25.\n\nSo from the Docket, the decree date is 03/14/2025. The entry 46's \"Signed by Judge... on 3/14/2025\" is the date.\n\nAlso, the Memorandum document (which was read partially) says \"Filed 03/14/25\" in the header. So the Memorandum was filed on 03/14/25, which is the same as the order.\n\nSo the decree date is 2025-03-14, and the event is the denial of the motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nNow, I need to extract this as a value in the format: [date]: [decree event]. So \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction.\"\n\nCheck if there are other dates. The Docket has entry 46 as the key one. Entry 38 was an extension, but that's a temporary order, not the final decree. The final decree is the denial on 03/14/25.\n\nSo the only value is 2025-03-14 with the event.\n\nNow, the evidence must include the text, source document, and location. The Docket entry 46 provides the date and event. The source document is \"Docket\", location is entry 46 (or the specific line in the Docket).\n\nWait, the Docket is a document, and entry 46 is part of it. So the evidence text would be the line from Docket: \"46 | 2025-03-14 | ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 3/14/2025. (kns, Deputy Clerk) (Entered: 03/14/2025)\"\n\nSo the text snippet is that line, source is \"Docket\", location is \"Docket entry 46\".\n\nAlso, the Memorandum has \"Filed 03/14/25\" but that's the filing date of the Memorandum, which is the opinion, but the decree is the order. However, the order is part of the Docket, so the Docket entry is the primary source.\n\nSo I should use the Docket entry 46 as the evidence.\n\nNow, the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" needs this value. Since it's the only one found, I'll append it.\n\nWait, the user said \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". So this is the only value.\n\nSo the next action is to use append_checklist to add this value with the evidence.\n\nThe extracted value should be formatted as \"[date]: [decree event]\". So \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction.\"\n\nCheck if the date is correctly formatted. The Docket uses \"03/14/25\" but the requirement says to format as [date], so probably YYYY-MM-DD. So 2025-03-14.\n\nThe event description: \"Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction.\"\n\nNow, the evidence must have the text snippet, source document, location.\n\nText: \"ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 3/14/2025.\"\n\nSource: \"Docket\"\n\nLocation: \"Docket entry 46\"\n\nWait, the Docket is a document, and the entry is listed as \"46 | 2025-03-14 | ...\", so location can be \"Docket entry 46\".\n\nSo the evidence array will have one entry with text, source, location.\n\nNow, the action to take is append_checklist with the key \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" and the extracted value.\n\nCheck if the document Docket is fully visited. The status says \"Docket [Docket] - 4,878 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\" so it's already read, so no need to read again.\n\nSo the correct action is to append the checklist item with the evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"46 | 2025-03-14 | ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction.

The other documents are unvisited. The task requires extracting EVERY distinct date, so I need to check if there are more dates in the remaining documents.\n\nThe Memorandum document (which was read up to 10,000 tokens) is the most likely place to find additional decree dates. The current read only covered the first 10k tokens, but the document has 23k tokens total. The next logical step would be to read the remaining tokens of the Memorandum to see if there are more decree dates mentioned there.\n\nI should avoid reading the same tokens again. The Memorandum's Viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next read should start at 10001. The maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, so I'll read from 10001 to 20000 (10k tokens). That way, I cover the next chunk without exceeding the limit.\n\nThe other documents (Complaint, Brief, etc.) are unvisited, but since the Memorandum is the main opinion document and has the most context about the case, it's the highest priority to continue reading there. The Docket already gave one date, but the Memorandum might have more details about decree dates, especially since it's the court's memorandum opinion.\n\nI need to make sure I don't miss any dates in the Memorandum. The current read stopped at page 14 (tokens 0-10000), but the document goes to page 35. There could be more dates in the later pages. So, reading from 10001-20000 is the next best move.\n\nNo need to use regex search here because the task is specific to decree dates, and the Memorandum is the most relevant document. The Docket already gave one date, but the Memorandum is where the court's ruling details are likely.

The Docket document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, the Memorandum (Order/Opinion) is partially visited (tokens 0-20001 out of 23,031). The next step is to read the remaining tokens in Memorandum to check for more decree dates. The previous read was tokens 10001-20001, so the next range should be 20001-23031. But the maximum allowed per read is 10,000 tokens, so 20001-23031 is 3030 tokens, which is within the limit.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Memorandum as partially visited with 87% coverage (20001/23031 ≈ 86.8%).

The task is to extract all decree dates from legal documents, specifically the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's already been done. From the provided history:\n\n- Step 1: list_documents found 7 documents\n- Step 2: read_document on Memorandum (tokens 0-10000) - no decree dates found\n- Step 3: read_document on Docket (tokens 0-4878) - found one decree date (2025-03-14)\n- Step 4: append_checklist added that date\n- Step 5: read_document on Memorandum (tokens 10001-20001) - no new decree dates\n- Step 6: read_document on Memorandum (tokens 20001-23031) - no new decree dates\n\nCurrent status shows 1 value extracted for Dates_of_All_Decrees, all documents except 4 are fully visited. The unvisited documents are:\n- Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n- Brief of Amicus Curiae\n- Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\n\nThe checklist item definition specifies: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The definition also clarifies that decree dates include \"entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates.\"\n\nThe current extracted value is \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction\" from Docket entry 46. This appears to be the final order denying the motion, which is a decree.\n\nNow I need to check if there are any other decree dates in the unvisited documents. The definition says \"decree-related dates\" - so I should look for:\n- Dates when orders were entered\n- Dates when orders were modified\n- Dates when orders were stayed\n- Dates when orders were terminated\n\nThe unvisited documents include:\n1. Complaint (unlikely to contain decree dates - this is the initial filing)\n2. Amicus Brief (likely contains arguments, not decree dates)\n3. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (this might contain a dismissal date, but the definition specifies \"decree dates\" for injunctions, consent decrees, etc. - a dismissal might not be a decree)\n4. Plaintiff's Memorandum (motion support, not decree dates)\n5. Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO (this is a motion, not a decree)\n\nHowever, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might contain a date of dismissal, which could be considered a decree date. The definition says \"full termination/vacatur dates\" - dismissal could be a form of termination.\n\nLooking at the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal document (which is unvisited), it's likely to contain a dismissal date. The Docket shows:\n50 | 2025-05-29 | NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore\n\nSo there's a notice of voluntary dismissal on 2025-05-29. But is this a \"decree\" date? The definition says \"for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions.\" A dismissal is a final order that terminates the case, so it could be considered a \"full termination\" date.\n\nThe current extracted value is for the denial of the motion (2025-03-14), but the dismissal is a separate event. I should check if the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal document contains the dismissal date as a decree.\n\nSince the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is unvisited, I should read it to confirm if it contains a decree date. The document name is \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" - this is likely a court order, so it would have a date.\n\nI should call read_document on the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" document to check for decree dates. The token count is 1,199 tokens, which is well under the 10,000 limit.\n\nWait, but the definition says \"decree dates\" - for dismissal, it's not a decree but a dismissal. Let me double-check the checklist definition: \"Dates_of_All_Decrees: The decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates...\"\n\n\"Full termination\" would include dismissal. So the dismissal date (2025-05-29) should be included as a decree date.\n\nThe Docket shows the dismissal was filed on 2025-05-29, and there's a \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" on 2025-06-12. So the dismissal was approved on 2025-06-12.\n\nThe checklist definition says \"entry dates\" - so the date the order was entered (2025-06-12) would be the decree date, not the filing date (2025-05-29).\n\nThe Docket shows:\n51 | 2025-06-12 | MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.\n\nSo the order approving dismissal was entered on 2025-06-12. This should be included as a decree date.\n\nBut I need to confirm from the document itself, not just the Docket. The Docket is a summary, but the actual order document would have the decree date.\n\nSo I should read the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" document to find the actual decree date. Wait, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is the notice filed by plaintiffs, and the marginal order is the court's order approving it. The marginal order would be the decree.\n\nBut the marginal order is listed as \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" - this is likely a short order, so the document name might be \"Marginal Order\" but it's listed as \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" in the catalog.\n\nLooking at the available documents, \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" is listed, but there's also a \"Marginal Order\" mentioned in the Docket. However, the catalog shows only \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" as the document name for that entry.\n\nI think I should read the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" document to check if it contains the decree date (the approval date, 2025-06-12).\n\nThe document has 1,199 tokens, so I can read the entire document.\n\nSo the next action should be to read_document on \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" (tokens 0-1199).\n\nAfter reading it, if it contains the decree date (2025-06-12), I'll append it to the checklist. If not, I'll check other documents, but this is the most promising candidate for another decree date.\n\nLet me confirm the checklist definition again: \"full termination/vacatur dates\" - a dismissal is a form of termination, so the approval date of dismissal should be included.\n\nSo the next action is to read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1199}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1199}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 32733, "completion_tokens": 1699, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 8, "run_id": "a1dc8f47-29c5-4196-83a1-d844b47efdf9", "timestamp": "2025-11-16T03:00:58.925092-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let me tackle this legal checklist extraction task. The goal is to extract all decree dates from the documents, specifically focusing on the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item.\n\nFirst, I'll review the current status. The system has already extracted one value from the Docket document (entry 46 dated 2025-03-14). The extracted value is \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction\". \n\nNow I need to check if there are any other decree dates in the remaining unvisited documents. The available documents include:\n- Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (6,497 tokens)\n- Amicus Brief (11,062 tokens)\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum (8,350 tokens)\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO (706 tokens)\n\nSince the current extracted value is from the Docket (which is fully visited), I should focus on the unvisited documents. The key is to look for any decree dates in these documents. \n\nI recall that \"decree dates\" include entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc. for injunctions, consent decrees, etc. The previous extraction was about a denial of a motion (which is not a decree), but the system's documentation says to include \"entry dates of court orders\" like consent decrees.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, I see entry 46 is an order denying the TRO (which was converted to a preliminary injunction motion). But entry 51 is \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" dated 2025-06-12. That's a court order approving dismissal, so that should be a decree date.\n\nWait, in the Docket, entry 51 says: \"51 | 2025-06-12 | MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 6/12/2025.\"\n\nSo that's a court order (the marginal order) approving the voluntary dismissal, dated 2025-06-12. That should be extracted as a decree date.\n\nThe system already extracted entry 46, but missed entry 51. The Docket was fully visited (tokens 0-4878), so why wasn't this extracted earlier? Probably because the extraction process is step-by-step and entry 51 was not processed yet.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited, I should have extracted all decree dates from it. The current extracted value only has one entry (from 46), but there's another one in entry 51. So I need to append the 2025-06-12 date.\n\nBut wait, the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 1\", meaning they only have the one value. So I should append the second value from the Docket.\n\nHowever, the Docket was fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't be reading it again. But the extraction process might have missed entry 51 earlier. Since the document is fully visited, I can use `append_checklist` to add the missing value.\n\nThe value for entry 51: \"2025-06-12: Approval of voluntary dismissal\" (since it's a marginal order approving the dismissal).\n\nEvidence:\n- Source document: Docket\n- Location: Docket entry 51\n- Text: \"51 | 2025-06-12 | MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 6/12/2025.\"\n\nThis is a court order (marginal order), so it qualifies as a decree.\n\nAlso, checking other documents: the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (which is fully visited) mentions \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", but the actual decree date is in the Docket entry 51, not in the notice itself. So the notice document doesn't contain a new decree date.\n\nThe other unvisited documents (Complaint, Amicus Brief, etc.) are likely to contain motions or arguments, not court orders with dates. But to be thorough, I should consider if any of them contain decree dates. However, the Complaint (entry 1) is the initial filing, not a decree. The Motion for TRO (entry 8) is a motion, not a decree. The Memorandum (which was fully visited) contains the court's opinion dated March 14, 2025, but that's the date of the opinion, not a decree entry. The decree would be the order dated March 14 (entry 46) and June 12 (entry 51).\n\nSo the only additional decree date to extract is 2025-06-12 from Docket entry 51.\n\nTherefore, I need to use `append_checklist` to add this value.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Do not include dates for non-decree items (e.g., private settlements not entered as orders)\". The approval of voluntary dismissal is a court order, so it should be included.\n\nThe extracted value should be: \"2025-06-12: Approval of voluntary dismissal\"\n\nNow, to confirm: the Docket entry 51 says \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", so it's a court order, hence a decree.\n\nSo the next action is to append this value to Dates_of_All_Decrees.\n\nThe current extracted value is:\n- 2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction\n\nNow adding:\n- 2025-06-12: Approval of voluntary dismissal\n\nI need to make sure the evidence is correctly cited.\n\nSo the `append_checklist` call should have the new value with evidence from Docket entry 51.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"2025-06-12: Approval of voluntary dismissal\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"51 | 2025-06-12 | MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and we need to find every distinct date related to decrees, modifications, suspensions, etc.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are two entries already extracted. The first one is from the Docket entry 46 dated 2025-03-14, which was a denial of a motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction. The second entry is from Docket entry 51 dated 2025-06-12, which is the approval of a voluntary dismissal.\n\nNow, the user has provided the documents that have been read so far: Docket, Memorandum, and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice. All of these are marked as fully visited. The other documents (Complaint, Amicus Brief, Memorandum of Points, Motion for TRO) are unvisited. \n\nWait, the Memorandum was read in three parts: tokens 0-10000, 10001-20000, and 20001-23031. But the user mentioned that the Memorandum is fully visited. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal was read entirely. The Docket was read in full as well.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are any other decree dates in the unvisited documents. The checklist requires extracting all decree dates, so we need to make sure we've covered all documents. The current extracted values are from the Docket, but maybe the other documents have more dates.\n\nWait, the Memorandum (Order/Opinion) is a court order, so it might have a date. The Memorandum was filed on 2025-03-14, as seen in the document headers: \"Filed 03/14/25\". But the first extracted value is from the Docket entry 46, which is the same date. The Memorandum itself is the court's opinion, so the filing date might be the decree date. However, the requirement says to extract decree dates, which are specific to the decree. The Memorandum is the court's opinion, so the date it was filed (March 14, 2025) is the date the order was entered. But the first entry already has that date. Let me check the existing entries.\n\nThe first entry is \"2025-03-14: Denial of motion for temporary restraining order, construed as motion for preliminary injunction\". The Memorandum's document header says \"Filed 03/14/25\", so that's the same date. But the decree date here is the date the order was entered, which is March 14, 2025. So the existing entry already covers that. The second entry is the approval of dismissal on June 12, 2025.\n\nNow, looking at the unvisited documents: Complaint, Amicus Brief, Memorandum of Points, Motion for TRO. These are pleadings or motions, not court orders, so they might not contain decree dates. But the Motion for TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) might have a date, but TROs are not decrees. The checklist specifies decree-related dates, including entry dates of orders, modifications, etc. So the Complaint might have dates, but they're not decree dates. The Amicus Brief and other motions are supporting documents, not the actual court orders.\n\nWait, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal was read, and the Docket entry 51 is the approval of the dismissal, which was extracted. The Memorandum (the court's opinion) was filed on March 14, 2025, which is the same as the Docket entry 46. So that's already covered.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are any other documents that might have decree dates. The unvisited documents are all pleadings or motions, not court orders. The only court orders mentioned so far are the Memorandum (the opinion) and the Docket entries. The Memorandum is a court order, so its filing date is the decree date. But that's already in the extracted values.\n\nWait, the Memorandum is the court's opinion, so the date it was filed (March 14, 2025) is the date the order was entered. The Docket entry 46 refers to the order granting the motion and denying the TRO, which was signed on that date. So the date is already captured.\n\nThe only other document that might have a decree date is the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, but that's a pleading, not a decree. The dismissal was approved on June 12, 2025, which is already in the extracted values (Docket entry 51).\n\nSo all decree dates should be covered. The two entries are from the Docket entries, which correspond to the court's orders. The other documents (unvisited) are not court orders, so they don't contain decree dates.\n\nThe current status shows 2 values extracted, and all documents are either fully visited or unvisited. But the unvisited documents are not court orders, so they won't have decree dates. Therefore, there's no need to read them. The checklist is complete with two entries.\n\nWait, but the user says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to make sure we haven't missed any. Let me double-check the documents we've read.\n\n- Docket: has two entries (46 and 51), both extracted.\n- Memorandum: filed on 03/14/25, which matches the first entry.\n- Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: mentions the dismissal, but the decree date is the approval date (06/12/25), which is in the Docket entry 51.\n\nThe other documents: Complaint (filed 02/07/25?), but that's the filing date of the complaint, not a decree. The Motion for TRO was filed on 02/07/25 (as per the document header?), but TROs are not decrees. The Amicus Brief and Memorandum of Points are supporting documents, so no decree dates there.\n\nTherefore, the two extracted dates are the only ones. The checklist should be complete. The next action would be to stop, since all values are extracted.\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 2\". So the key Dates_of_All_Decrees has two values. The user hasn't indicated any missing values. The unvisited documents are not expected to contain decree dates, as they are pleadings, not orders. So the checklist is complete.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All decree dates have been extracted from fully visited documents.

The user is asking to extract decree dates from legal documents, specifically the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" checklist item. From the prior steps, they've already extracted two dates: March 14, 2025 (from the Memorandum) and June 12, 2025 (from the Docket entry). \n\nLooking at the current status, all three documents that were read (Docket, Memorandum, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal) are marked as fully visited. The other four documents (Complaint, Amicus Brief, etc.) are unvisited but are pleadings/motions, not court orders. The checklist explicitly says not to include non-decree items like private settlements or pleadings.\n\nThe user's step 9 already called `stop`, but the system automatically ran `get_checklist` and shows 2 values for Dates_of_All_Decrees. The extraction progress says \"1/1 filled\" meaning all keys are covered. \n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event]'.\" They have two entries: \n- 2025-03-14: Approval of voluntary dismissal? Wait no, the evidence says \"2025-06-12: Approval of voluntary dismissal\" from Docket entry 51. The March 14 date is actually the Memorandum's filing date (March 14, 2025), but the checklist requires decree dates. \n\nWait, the Memorandum (Document 45) was filed March 14, 2025, and it's a court order denying the preliminary injunction. That's a decree date. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal was filed May 29, 2025, but the actual decree date for dismissal approval is June 12, 2025 (Docket entry 51). So both are valid decree dates.\n\nThe system's checklist status shows 2 values, and the unvisited documents are all pleadings/motions which don't contain court orders. The instructions say: \"Do not include dates for non-decree items (e.g., private settlements not entered as orders).\" So the unvisited docs (Complaint, Amicus Brief, etc.) can't have decree dates.\n\nThe current status says \"All decree dates have been extracted\" in step 9. The automatic `get_checklist` confirms 2 values. There's no missing evidence. The user shouldn't need to read more documents because the unvisited ones aren't relevant per the checklist definition.\n\nAlso, the Not Applicable count is 0, and all keys are filled. So the stop criteria are met. The system even says \"this is stop attempt 1/2\" but since there are no gaps, it's safe to stop now.\n\nI should check if there's any possible missing decree date. The Memorandum (order) has March 14 date, Docket has June 12 date. The Notice of Dismissal itself (May 29) isn't a decree date—it's the filing of the notice. The decree date is when the court approved it (June 12). So both are correctly captured.\n\nNo need for more actions.
