The user needs me to extract the parties involved from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which requires identifying plaintiffs and defendants with their roles.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: there are 0 documents in the corpus. The system says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, I can't read any documents because there are none.\n\nThe task requires extracting from the documents, but there are no documents listed. The next action should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since there are no documents discovered yet, the catalog is unknown. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the tools provided. The `list_documents` function doesn't require any parameters. So the next step is to call that function to discover what documents exist in the corpus. Once I have the list, I can proceed to read or search them. But right now, with no documents, I can't do anything else.

The available documents are all unvisited, so I should start with the Complaint since that's where parties are typically listed.

The document is marked as unvisited, so no previous tokens have been read. The next step is to call read_document on the Complaint from token 0 to 6,497. That way, I can get the full text to look for the parties. \n\nWait, the instructions say to avoid rereading, but since it's unvisited, it's okay.

The user needs me to extract the parties involved from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which should have entries formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, there's 1 key empty: Who_are_the_Parties. The recent action was reading the Complaint document (tokens 0-6497), which is fully visited. The document text shows the parties clearly. \n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs are \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\" and \"Economic Action Maryland Fund\". The defendants are \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" and \"Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\".\n\nSo I need to create two plaintiff entries and two defendant entries. Each should have the proper format. Let me check the text again to confirm. \n\nPage 1 lists Plaintiffs as Baltimore and Economic Action Maryland Fund. Defendants are CFPB and Russell Vought. Then in the \"Parties\" section (page 3), it details each party. For example, Plaintiff 1: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, etc. Defendant 3: CFPB, Defendant 4: Russell Vought.\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\nPlaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (\"a municipal corporation...\")\n\nPlaintiff: Economic Action Maryland Fund (\"a statewide nonprofit movement...\")\n\nDefendant: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"a federal financial regulatory agency...\")\n\nDefendant: Russell Vought (\"Acting Director of the CFPB...\")\n\nEach needs evidence with text, source document, location. The document is \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location is page 3, sections 1 and 3.\n\nWait, the user's example shows the text from the document. Let me get the exact quotes. \n\nFrom the document:\n\n\"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation...\"\n\n\"Plaintiff Economic Action Maryland Fund (“Economic Action”) is a statewide nonprofit...\"\n\n\"Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is a federal financial regulatory agency...\"\n\n\"Defendant Russell Vought is the Acting Director of the CFPB. He is sued in his official capacity.\"\n\nSo the evidence for each should include the specific paragraph. The location can be the page number mentioned in the document (Page 3 for the parties section).\n\nSo for each entry, the evidence will have the text snippet, source document name, and location (e.g., \"Page 3, Paragraph 1\" or \"Page 3, Parties section\").\n\nNow, since the document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and I've read it, the next step is to append the checklist entries. Since the key is currently empty, I should use append_checklist to add all four entries.\n\nWait, the checklist item allows multiple values, so each plaintiff and defendant is a separate entry. The user's requirement says \"EVERY distinct value\", so each party's description counts as a separate entry.\n\nSo I need to create four entries under Who_are_the_Parties. Each entry must have value formatted as 'Plaintiff: ...' or 'Defendant: ...', and evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value field should be exactly like that. For example, \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\".\n\nBut in the document, the description includes more details. However, the requirement is to have the value as 'Plaintiff: [description]', where [description] is the part after \"Plaintiff\" in the document. Wait, no. The example in the checklist says the value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]', so the [description] is the specific text they want. But looking at the document, the parties are listed with their full descriptions. So the value should be 'Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland' followed by the description? Wait, no, the instruction says \"the extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]'\", so the [description] is the part after 'Plaintiff', which in the document is \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\". But the document actually says \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland...\", so the [description] would be \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\".\n\nWait, the example in the document's parties section says:\n\n\"1. Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation...\"\n\nSo the value should be 'Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland', but the description includes the parenthetical. However, the instruction says to format as 'Plaintiff: [description]', so the [description] is the name of the party as listed. So the value would be \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\".\n\nSimilarly, the defendant entries would be \"Defendant: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" and \"Defendant: Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\".\n\nWait, but the document lists them as \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" and \"Russell Vought, in his official capacity...\". So the value should capture the exact name as presented.\n\nSo for each, the value is:\n\n- \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\"\n\n- \"Plaintiff: Economic Action Maryland Fund\"\n\n- \"Defendant: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"\n\n- \"Defendant: Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"\n\nBut wait, the instruction says \"the extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]'\". So the [description] is the part after 'Plaintiff', which in the document is \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\". But the document actually writes \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council...\", so the description part is \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\".\n\nSimilarly, for the defendants, it's \"Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\" so the description is \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\".\n\nBut the document also says \"Defendant Russell Vought, in his official capacity...\". So the description here would be \"Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\".\n\nTherefore, the values should be:\n\n- Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\n\n- Plaintiff: Economic Action Maryland Fund\n\n- Defendant: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\n- Defendant: Russell Vought, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nNow, for evidence, each needs a verbatim text snippet. Let's find the exact lines.\n\nFor the first plaintiff:\n\n\"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution...\"\n\nSo the text for evidence is \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation...\"\n\nSource document: \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\"\n\nLocation: \"Page 3, Paragraph 1\"\n\nSimilarly for Economic Action:\n\n\"Plaintiff Economic Action Maryland Fund (“Economic Action”) is a statewide nonprofit movement...\"\n\nText: \"Plaintiff Economic Action Maryland Fund (“Economic Action”) is a statewide nonprofit movement...\"\n\nLocation: Page 3, Paragraph 2\n\nDefendant CFPB:\n\n\"Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is a federal financial regulatory agency...\"\n\nText: \"Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is a federal financial regulatory agency...\"\n\nLocation: Page 3, Paragraph 3\n\nDefendant Russell Vought:\n\n\"Defendant Russell Vought is the Acting Director of the CFPB. He is sued in his official capacity.\"\n\nText: \"Defendant Russell Vought is the Acting Director of the CFPB. He is sued in his official capacity.\"\n\nLocation: Page 3, Paragraph 4\n\nWait, the document's \"Parties\" section on page 3 lists them as numbered points 1-4. So each is a paragraph.\n\nSo the evidence for each will have the text, source, and location.\n\nNow, since the document is fully visited, and we've read it, the next action is to append the checklist entries. The current state shows 0 values extracted, so we need to append all four.\n\nThe function to use is append_checklist, with a patch array containing the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" and the extracted list of four entries, each with their evidence.\n\nCheck the parameters for append_checklist: the patch should be an array of objects, each with key and extracted (array of entries). Each entry has evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo for each of the four entries, create an extracted entry with evidence.\n\nWait, the evidence is an array, but each entry should have one evidence entry. So for each value, the evidence array will have one item.\n\nSo for the first entry:\n\nvalue: \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\"\n\nevidence: [ { text: \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, entrusted with all the powers of local self-government and home rule afforded by those articles. Baltimore is the largest city in Maryland and the thirteenth largest city in the United States.\", source_document: \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location: \"Page 3, Paragraph 1\" } ]\n\nWait, but the exact text snippet should be the part that describes the party, but the instruction says \"verbatim snippet\". So the text should be the exact phrase where the party is introduced.\n\nIn the document, the text for the first plaintiff is:\n\n\"1. Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, entrusted with all the powers of local self-government and home rule afforded by those articles. Baltimore is the largest city in Maryland and the thirteenth largest city in the United States.\"\n\nBut the value is \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\", so the text should be the full sentence, but the evidence needs to be the verbatim text. So the text field in evidence should be the entire sentence from the document where the party is named.\n\nBut the user's example in the problem statement shows that evidence should include \"verbatim snippet\", so we take the exact text from the document.\n\nTherefore, for the first entry, the evidence text is \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, entrusted with all the powers of local self-government and home rule afforded by those articles. Baltimore is the largest city in Maryland and the thirteenth largest city in the United States.\"\n\nBut wait, the value is supposed to be \"Plaintiff: [description]\", so the [description] is \"Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\", but the evidence text is the full line where it's stated. So the value field is \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\", and the evidence text is the full sentence from the document.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo the value for the first entry is \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\"\n\nThe evidence text is the full sentence starting with \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council...\"\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nNow, check the document's page numbers. The document shows \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA Document 1 Filed 02/12/25 Page 3 of 15\", and the parties section starts at paragraph 1 on page 3.\n\nSo location for each is \"Page 3, Paragraph 1\" (and so on).\n\nNow, compiling all four entries.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch will have:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”) is a municipal corporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, entrusted with all the powers of local self-government and home rule afforded by those articles.
