The user is trying to extract trial information from legal documents, but the current status shows there are 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Trials\" is empty, and all the documents are unknown.\n\nHmm, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the system says \"No documents discovered yet,\" the next logical action should be to list the documents. The available tools include `list_documents`, which is used to get all documents with their metadata. Without knowing the documents, I can't proceed to read or search them.\n\nThe user's task requires extracting from documents, but there are none listed. So the correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover what's in the corpus. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` wouldn't work because there are no documents to read or search. The system says the document catalog is unknown, so per the Decision Policy, if the catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`.\n\nI should make sure not to make any assumptions. The current state clearly states \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So the only possible first action is to list the documents. No other functions are applicable here. Let me check the tools again to confirm. Yes, `list_documents` is the correct first step.

The user needs to extract all trial information from the documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\" which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain trial information. The available documents are a Complaint, Docket, Memorandum (Order/Opinion), several Briefs, a Notice of Dismissal, and a Motion for TRO. \n\nThe Docket (4,878 tokens) is usually a chronological list of court events, so it's a prime candidate for trial dates and proceedings. The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) might have rulings related to trials. The Motion for TRO and other Briefs might mention trial dates as part of their arguments.\n\nSince the Docket is unvisited and likely to have the most direct trial-related info, I should start there. The current status shows all keys are empty, so I need to read the Docket first. The Docket is 4,878 tokens, which is under the 10k limit, so reading the whole thing in one go makes sense. \n\nI'll use read_document on the Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 4878. That way, I get all the content. After reading, I can look for any mentions of \"trial,\" \"scheduling,\" \"proceedings,\" or specific dates. Once I have the text, I can check for relevant info and then use append_checklist to add the entries with evidence.\n\nNo need for regex here since the Docket's structure is likely to have clear entries. So the next step is to read the Docket document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4878}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4878}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3406, "completion_tokens": 392, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all trial-related information from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current status. The Docket document has been fully read (tokens 0-4878), and it's marked as ✓ Fully Visited. The other documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The checklist for \"Trials\" is currently empty.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, I need to check if there's any mention of trials. Let's scan through the entries:\n\n- Entry 24 mentions a hearing on February 26, 2025, for a preliminary injunction. That's a hearing related to a motion, not a trial.\n- Entry 35 says \"Motion Hearing held on 2/26/2025 re 17 Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief\". So there was a hearing, but it's a preliminary injunction hearing, not a trial.\n- Entry 46 states the court \"granted 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction.\" So the motion for TRO was denied, and it's treated as a preliminary injunction motion.\n- Entry 50 is a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and 51 is the order approving it. The case was dismissed, so no trial occurred.\n\nHmm, the Docket mentions hearings and motions, but not a trial. The key here is that \"Trials\" should capture actual trial information. Since the Docket doesn't mention a trial (only preliminary injunction hearings and a dismissal), maybe the \"Trials\" item is Not Applicable. But wait, the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. The dismissal might mean there was no trial, but I need to check if any other documents mention a trial.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Memorandum, Amicus Brief, Notice of Dismissal, Plaintiff's Memorandum, and Motion for TRO. The Complaint might have trial details, but since the case was dismissed, maybe the trial was never scheduled. However, I can't assume that. I need to check the other documents to be sure.\n\nWait, the Docket says the case was dismissed on May 29, 2025 (entry 50), and the order was approved on June 12 (entry 51). So the case ended without a trial. But does that mean \"Trials\" is Not Applicable? The checklist definition says \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" If there was no trial, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But the evidence needs to be explicit. The dismissal without trial could be the evidence.\n\nHowever, the instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nHere, the dismissal (entry 50: \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\") and the order (51) confirm the case was dismissed without trial. So the evidence for Not Applicable is the dismissal. But the Docket entry 50 says \"Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", which typically means the plaintiff dropped the case, so no trial occurred.\n\nBut I need to make sure there's no trial mentioned elsewhere. The other documents might have more info. For example, the Complaint might mention a trial, but since it's a complaint, it's unlikely. The Motion for TRO (entry 8) and the related hearings (24,25,35) are about preliminary injunction, not a trial.\n\nWait, the checklist is for \"Trials\", not \"Hearings\" or \"Motions\". So if there's no trial, then the item should be Not Applicable. The Docket has the dismissal, so I can use that to set \"Trials\" as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the current status shows \"Trials\" is empty. The next step is to check if the dismissal is sufficient evidence. The dismissal entry (50) says \"Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", which means the case was closed without a trial. So the evidence is there in the Docket.\n\nHowever, the instructions say to use `update_checklist` to set Not Applicable with a single entry. So I should create a checklist entry for \"Trials\" with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the dismissal.\n\nBut wait, the user's recent action was reading the Docket, and the Docket was fully read. Now, after reading it, I need to check if any trial info was found. Since there's no trial mentioned, but the case was dismissed without trial, I can mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next action should be to use `update_checklist` to set \"Trials\" to Not Applicable with evidence from the dismissal.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, entry 50: \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (Samburg, Mark) (Entered: 05/29/2025)\" and entry 51: \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal... Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 6/12/2025.\"\n\nThe dismissal order (51) confirms the case was dismissed without trial. So the evidence is the dismissal, which means no trial occurred.\n\nTherefore, I should call `update_checklist` with the key \"Trials\" and value \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from entries 50 and 51.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Trials\", and the value should be \"Not Applicable\". The evidence needs to include the text, source document, and location. The source document is Docket, location is entries 50 and 51.\n\nSo the evidence would have text snippets from those entries, source document \"Docket\", location \"Entry 50 and 51\".\n\nBut the `update_checklist` requires a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\". So the extracted list should have one entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the dismissal.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use `update_checklist` to set \"Trials\" to Not Applicable with the evidence from the dismissal entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Trials\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (Samburg, Mark) (Entered: 05/29/2025)\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Entry 50\"}, {\"text\": \"MARGINAL ORDER APPROVING 50 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Economic Action Maryland Fund, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.

The user is asking to extract trial information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 used `update_checklist` to mark \"Trials\" as Not Applicable based on the Docket entries 50 and 51 about a voluntary dismissal. The Docket was fully read (tokens 0-4878), and the dismissal seems to indicate no trial occurred.\n\nBut wait, the current status shows \"Trials\" as Not Applicable with evidence from the dismissal. However, the system's instructions say that Not Applicable must be explicitly stated or logically dispositive. A voluntary dismissal without prejudice might not necessarily mean there was no trial scheduled. Wait, the Docket entries 50 and 51 mention \"Voluntary Dismissal\" and the order approving it, but the actual trial scheduling might be in other documents.\n\nThe available documents include other files like Complaint, Memorandum, Briefs, etc. The Docket was fully visited, but maybe other documents have trial-related info. For example, the \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (ECF 8) and the hearing on Feb 26 (Entry 35) might be part of the trial proceedings.\n\nWait, Entry 35 says \"Motion Hearing held on 2/26/2025 re 17 Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief\". A motion hearing for a preliminary injunction isn't the same as a trial. A trial would typically be a full trial, not a preliminary hearing. The order in Entry 46 says they denied the TRO (which was construed as a motion for preliminary injunction) and granted the motion for leave to file a reply. Then the case was dismissed voluntarily.\n\nBut the checklist item is about \"trials\", which usually refers to the main trial, not preliminary motions. The dismissal without prejudice might mean the case was dismissed before trial, so no trial occurred. However, the user's Step 3 marked it as Not Applicable based on the dismissal, but maybe there's a trial scheduled elsewhere.\n\nWait, the Docket entries show a hearing on Feb 26 for the preliminary injunction, but that's not a trial. The case was dismissed on May 29 (Entry 50), so no trial happened. Therefore, \"Trials\" should be Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's current status says it's already marked as Not Applicable. However, the available documents include others like the Complaint, which might have details about trial dates. Wait, the Complaint is a filing, but it's unlikely to have a trial date. The Motion for TRO (ECF 8) might have a hearing date, but that's not a trial. The checklist specifies \"trials\", so if no trial was scheduled or held, then it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut the system's instruction says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" The dismissal without prejudice (Entry 50) is a dispositive event that indicates the case was dismissed before trial, so no trial occurred. Therefore, \"Trials\" should be Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 3 already did that. The current status shows \"Trials\" as Not Applicable. The next step is to check if all keys are covered. The checklist has only one item: Trials. Since it's marked as Not Applicable with evidence, and the case was dismissed before trial, there's no trial to report.\n\nBut the available documents are unvisited (Complaint, Memorandum, etc.), but they might not contain trial information. For example, the Complaint might not mention a trial date. The Motion for TRO and the hearing on Feb 26 are preliminary, not a trial. The order denying the TRO (Entry 46) states they denied the motion for TRO (which was treated as a preliminary injunction), but a trial would be separate. Since the case was dismissed voluntarily, no trial occurred.\n\nTherefore, the \"Trials\" key is correctly marked as Not Applicable. The user's current status shows that all keys (only one) are either filled or Not Applicable. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" The checklist has only one key, Trials, which is set to Not Applicable. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The checklist definition says \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" If there was a hearing (Entry 35), is that considered part of a trial? The hearing was for a motion for preliminary injunction, which is part of the pre-trial process, but the trial itself hasn't happened. The case was dismissed before trial. So the trial didn't occur, so \"Trials\" is Not Applicable.\n\nYes, so the current state is complete. The user should stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are accounted for: 'Trials' is correctly marked as Not Applicable based on the voluntary dismissal (Entries 50-51) which confirms no trial occurred, with explicit evidence from the Docket.

The checklist item is \"Trials\" which includes scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents which found 7 documents. Step 2 read the Docket document (tokens 0-4878). Step 3 used update_checklist to mark Trials as \"Not Applicable\" based on Entries 50 and 51 (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Marginal Order approving it). Step 4 called stop, but the system then automatically ran get_checklist, showing that Trials is marked as Not Applicable with evidence.\n\nNow, the current status shows all keys (only Trials) are accounted for: it's marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The Available Documents section lists other documents as unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the system says \"No further documents need review as the dismissal is dispositive.\" The key point here is that the voluntary dismissal (Entries 50-51) explicitly ends the case without a trial, making Trials Not Applicable.\n\nThe user's instructions say to stop only when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Since Trials is already set as Not Applicable with proper evidence (the dismissal entries), and the system's automatic check confirms it's filled, there's no need to read other documents. The other documents might contain more info, but the dismissal is dispositive—no trial occurred, so no further extraction is needed.\n\nAlso, the \"Not Applicable Encoding\" rule says to use update_checklist to set it as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence.
