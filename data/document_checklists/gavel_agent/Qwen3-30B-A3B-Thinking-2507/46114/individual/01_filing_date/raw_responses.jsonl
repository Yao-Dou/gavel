The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty, and there are 7 unvisited documents. The task is to find the filing date. The most likely place to find the filing date would be in the Complaint, since that's typically where the case starts. The Complaint document is listed as \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" with 6,497 tokens, unvisited.\n\nI should check the Complaint first because it's the initial filing. The Docket might also have the date, but the Complaint is more probable. Since the document is unvisited, the next step is to read it. The maximum token range allowed per read is 10,000, and the Complaint is 6,497 tokens, so reading the whole thing is possible.\n\nI need to call read_document for the Complaint, starting at token 0 to 6497. That's within the limit. Using read_document makes sense here because the date might be in the header or early part of the document. If the date isn't there, maybe the Docket would have it, but starting with the Complaint is logical.\n\nThe other options: search_document_regex could be used if I knew the exact pattern, like \"Filed on\" or a date format, but since I don't have that info yet, reading the document directly is safer. So the correct action is to read the Complaint document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 6497}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 6497}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3407, "completion_tokens": 382, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents, which found 7 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, tokens 0-6497. The document text provided shows \"Filed 02/12/25\" on the first page. So the filing date is February 12, 2025.\n\nThe current status says Filing_Date is empty. The Complaint document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I can't read it again. But I already have the date from the text. The next step is to append this value to the checklist.\n\nI need to use append_checklist with the extracted value. The evidence should include the verbatim text \"Filed 02/12/25\", source document \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", and location as \"Page 1 of 15\" or similar. The date format is 02/12/25, which is February 12, 2025.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: text (verbatim), source_document, location. The document shows \"Filed 02/12/25\" on the first page. So the location can be \"Case header, Page 1\".\n\nSince this is the first value for Filing_Date, I should append it. No need for update_checklist here because it's the first entry. The checklist had 0 values, now adding one. After this, the key will have one entry, so it's no longer empty.\n\nThe available documents include the Complaint as fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but since the filing date is already found in the Complaint, there's no need to check others. The task is to extract every distinct value, and here it's a single date.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the value Filing_Date: \"02/12/25\" with the evidence from the document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"02/12/25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 02/12/25\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"location\": \"Case header, Page 1 of 15\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "02/12/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed 02/12/25", "source_document": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "location": "Case header, Page 1 of 15"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10386, "completion_tokens": 567, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. They've already done some steps. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 7 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint, which had the filing date as 02/12/25. Step 3 was append_checklist to add that date.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has one value from the Complaint, which is fully visited. The other documents are unvisited. The task is to extract every distinct value for Filing_Date. The question is, do any other documents have a different filing date?\n\nThe available documents include Docket, Memorandum, Brief of Amicus, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Memorandum for TRO, and Motion for TRO. The Complaint is the initial filing, so the Docket might have the same date, but maybe other documents have different dates. However, the Filing_Date is specifically the date the lawsuit was first filed, which should be the same as the Complaint's filing date. But I need to check if other documents mention a different date.\n\nWait, the Checklist definition says: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So it's the initial filing date. The Complaint's header says \"Filed 02/12/25\", so that's the date. But maybe other documents, like the Docket, could confirm it. However, the Docket might list the same date. But since the Complaint is the first document, the filing date should be there. The user already extracted it from the Complaint.\n\nThe next step: the user has one value. Are there other documents that might have a different filing date? Probably not, because the filing date is the date the case was initiated, so it's the same across all documents. But maybe the Docket has a different date? Unlikely. But to be thorough, maybe check the Docket.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Docket is unvisited. The Docket might have the filing date again. But since the Complaint already has it, and it's the first document, it's probably redundant. However, the instructions say to extract every distinct value. If the Docket also says 02/12/25, that's the same value, so it shouldn't be added again. But if it's a different date, then it would be a problem. But since it's the same case, the filing date should be the same.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract every distinct value. So if the same date appears in multiple documents, it's still one distinct value. So even if the Docket has the same date, it's not a new value. So the extraction is complete.\n\nBut wait, maybe the Docket has a different date? For example, maybe the case was filed on 02/12/25, but the Docket entry shows a different date. But that's unlikely. The Complaint's \"Filed\" date is the actual filing date.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value extracted, and all keys (only Filing_Date) are filled. The empty keys and Not Applicable are zero. So the checklist is complete. The next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user might need to confirm that no other documents have a different filing date. But according to the instructions, the Filing_Date is the initial filing date, which is in the Complaint. The other documents are subsequent filings (like motions, briefs), so their dates would be later, but the filing date refers to the initial filing. So the Docket might have the same date, but it's the same value.\n\nThe system's Stop Criteria: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete (all relevant values present) or Not Applicable.\" Since there's only one key, and it's already filled with one value (and it's the only possible value), the checklist is complete.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop. The user has already appended the value from the Complaint, and there's no need to check other documents because the filing date is the initial one, which is already captured. Other documents like the Docket might restate it, but it's the same value.
