The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the next step should be. The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are relevant. The available documents include Complaint, Docket, Memorandum (Order/Opinion), several briefs, a Notice of Dismissal, and a Motion for TRO. Since the decree duration would likely be in the court's order or opinion, the \"Memorandum [Order/Opinion]\" document seems the most promising. It's the longest at 23k tokens, which probably contains the actual court order details.\n\nThe other documents like the Complaint or Motion for TRO might mention temporary orders, but the decree duration for a formal court order (like a consent decree) is more likely in the Memorandum. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might indicate no decree, but the user's requirement says to only include court-ordered obligations, so dismissal might make it Not Applicable. But first, I need to check the documents.\n\nSince the catalog is known (7 documents listed), I shouldn't use list_documents again. The next step is to read the most relevant document. The Memorandum is the Order/Opinion, so reading that makes sense. The user said to read a targeted window up to 10k tokens. Since it's 23k, I can read the first part. But maybe check if there's a pattern like \"duration\" or \"decree\" in the document. Wait, the user mentioned using search_document_regex for patternable targets. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", so maybe a regex pattern like \"duration|term|effectiveness\" but the exact wording might be specific.\n\nWait, the instruction says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The key here is \"decree duration\", so maybe looking for phrases like \"decree shall remain in effect for\", \"duration of the decree\", etc. But the user's example in the policy mentions \"Case No.\", \"Filed:\", so maybe a regex like r'decree.*?duration|decree.*?term' but need to be precise.\n\nBut the user's current step is to choose the next action. The available documents are all unvisited. The Memorandum is the most likely to contain the decree. So reading it would be the best first step. The Docket might have the order date but not the duration. The Complaint might not have it. The Motion for TRO might mention temporary, but the decree duration is for formal orders, not temporary.\n\nSo, the first action should be to read the Memorandum document. Since it's 23k tokens, I'll read the first 10k tokens. The start_token is 0, end_token 10000. That's within the 10k limit. So the correct action is read_document on \"Memorandum\" from 0-10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3466, "completion_tokens": 668, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item from the legal documents. The current status shows it's empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I'll check the documents available. The Memorandum has been partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the relevant part about decree duration might not be there yet. The other documents are unvisited, so I need to figure out which one is most likely to contain the decree duration info.\n\nLooking at the checklist definition: it's about the duration of court-ordered decrees like injunctions, not negotiated agreements. The case involves a motion for preliminary injunction, so the Memorandum might discuss the injunction's duration.\n\nWait, the user's snapshot shows the Memorandum was read up to token 10,000. Let me check the provided text. The text includes the court's denial of the preliminary injunction motion. The key part would be if the court ordered a decree with a specific duration. But in the excerpt, the court says \"their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\" So there's no decree granted, just a denial. Therefore, the decree duration isn't specified here because the injunction wasn't issued.\n\nHmm, so the Memorandum might not contain the required info. The next step is to check other documents. The Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (Complaint) is likely to mention the requested relief, including duration. The Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) might also have it, but TROs are short-term, usually until a hearing. The checklist specifies \"decree,\" which is longer-term, so probably the injunction request.\n\nThe available documents include \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" which might have details about the requested relief. But since TROs are temporary, the actual decree duration might be in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (which was converted from the TRO).\n\nWait, the recent actions show they read the Memorandum (the court's opinion). The next logical step is to read the Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (706 tokens) or the Memorandum of Points (8,350 tokens). The Motion for TRO is shorter, so maybe start there.\n\nBut the checklist requires \"court-ordered decree,\" so the actual decree would be in the court's order, not the motion. The Memorandum (court opinion) was read, but it denied the injunction, so no decree was issued. Therefore, there might be no decree duration to extract. But the checklist says \"only include obligations that are ordered by the court,\" so if the court didn't issue a decree, this item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's task is to extract from the documents. If the court denied the injunction, there's no decree. However, the checklist says \"for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" If the court didn't issue one, then it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to confirm by checking if any document mentions a decree duration. The Memorandum was read, and it says the motion was denied, so no decree. But maybe another document, like the Complaint, specifies the requested duration. However, the checklist says \"ordered by the court,\" so the requested duration in the motion isn't relevant—it has to be the court's actual order.\n\nSo, the key point: the court denied the injunction, so there's no decree issued. Therefore, \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if any other document mentions a decree. The Docket might have the order, but it's unvisited. However, the Memorandum (court opinion) already states the injunction was denied, so the decree duration isn't applicable.\n\nThe user's current status shows the key is empty. Since the court didn't grant an injunction, there's no decree duration. So I need to set it to Not Applicable using update_checklist.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" Here, the court's denial is dispositive evidence that no decree was issued. The Memorandum states \"their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\" So no decree, hence Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to use update_checklist with the key set to \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the Memorandum.\n\nBut the user hasn't read the entire Memorandum, but the part they did read (up to page 16) already states the denial. The key evidence is in the text they've already read: \"their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\"\n\nSo I should use update_checklist to set How_Long_Decrees_will_Last to Not Applicable with evidence from the Memorandum.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.\", \"source_document\": \"Memorandum\", \"location\": \"Page 3, Line 12-14\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.", "source_document": "Memorandum", "location": "Page 3, Line 12-14"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13900, "completion_tokens": 1178, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
