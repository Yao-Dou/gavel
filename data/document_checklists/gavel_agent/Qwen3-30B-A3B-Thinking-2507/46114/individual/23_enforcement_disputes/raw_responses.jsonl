That's the first step before any extraction can happen. \n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't present yet. So the only valid action is list_documents. Let me check the tools again. Yes, list_documents is the function to call when the catalog is unknown. \n\nAlright, so the next action should be to call list_documents.

The user needs to extract all disputes over settlement enforcement from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", which specifically refers to disputes about enforcing a negotiated settlement (not a court order), like motions to enforce or contempt motions. Excluded are disputes over decrees.\n\nFirst, I should check the current status. The snapshot shows that all 7 documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), and the checklist key is empty. The task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to find where such disputes might be mentioned.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Docket\" is a good starting point because dockets often list motions and court actions. The \"Memorandum\" (Order/Opinion) might also have details on motions. The \"Brief\" and \"Motion\" documents could contain relevant arguments or requests.\n\nSince the checklist item is about motions to enforce settlements, I should search for keywords like \"enforce\", \"settlement\", \"contempt\", \"motion to enforce\", \"retained jurisdiction\". But the user mentioned using regex for patternable targets. However, the initial step is to read or search documents.\n\nThe current state has all documents unvisited, so the next logical step is to read a document that's most likely to contain the relevant information. The Docket (4,878 tokens) is a strong candidate because dockets typically list all filings and motions. The Complaint might have some, but dockets are more structured for tracking motions.\n\nWait, the Docket is labeled as [Docket], which is common for court dockets listing all entries. The Memorandum [Order/Opinion] might have the court's ruling on such motions, but the Docket would list the motions themselves. So starting with the Docket makes sense.\n\nI should use read_document on the Docket. The document is unvisited, so I'll read the entire document since it's under 10,000 tokens (4,878). The parameters would be doc_name: \"Docket\", start_token: 0, end_token: 4878.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex might be faster. Let me think: the regex pattern could be something like \"motion to enforce|contempt|settlement enforcement\". But the user's guidelines say to prefer precise patterns. However, since it's the first step and the document is small, reading the whole Docket is straightforward and ensures no missed context.\n\nThe decision here is to use read_document on the Docket. The other documents might have details, but the Docket is the primary place to find the list of motions. So the next action should be read_document for the Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4878}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4878}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3484, "completion_tokens": 609, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes related to enforcing a settlement, not decrees. So, I need to look for motions to enforce, contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction, but exclude anything about decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket document was fully read (tokens 0-4878), but the extracted values for the checklist are still empty. The Docket has entries like motions, orders, notices, but I need to check if any of them fit the criteria.\n\nScanning through the Docket entries: Entry 8 is a MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order. But that's a TRO, not about enforcing a settlement. Entries 10-15 are orders granting motions to appear pro hac vice, which aren't related. Entry 24 and 25 mention a preliminary injunction hearing, but that's about a motion, not enforcement of a settlement. Entry 38 is an order extending a temporary restraining order, still not a settlement enforcement. Entry 46 grants a motion for leave to file a reply and denies the TRO motion. Entry 50 is a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, which doesn't involve enforcement disputes.\n\nNone of the Docket entries mention settlements or enforcement disputes. The checklist item specifically excludes disputes over decrees, so even if there were settlement-related motions, they might be excluded. But in this Docket, there's no mention of settlements. The complaint is about injunctive relief, not a settlement.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Memorandum, Amicus Brief, Notice of Dismissal, Plaintiff's Memorandum, and Motion for TRO. The next step is to check if any of these documents might contain the required disputes. Since the Docket didn't have anything, I should look into the other documents.\n\nThe most relevant documents would likely be the ones related to motions and briefs. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (706 tokens) and the \"Plaintiff's Memorandum\" (8350 tokens) might have details about the dispute. But the checklist is about settlement enforcement, not TROs. However, maybe the motion or memorandum mentions a settlement that's being enforced.\n\nWait, the user specified that disputes over decrees (consent decrees) are excluded. So even if there's a settlement, if it's a decree, it's not included. But the checklist says \"settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\", so if there's a settlement agreement that's not a court order, then disputes over enforcing that would count.\n\nLooking at the Docket, entry 46 says \"denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction.\" So the motion was for a TRO, not a settlement. The complaint is for injunctive and declaratory relief, not a settlement.\n\nThe Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (entry 50) is a dismissal without prejudice, so no settlement enforcement there.\n\nSince the Docket didn't have anything, and the other documents are unvisited, I should read one of the relevant documents. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (706 tokens) might have some context, but the motion is for a TRO, not a settlement. However, maybe the motion mentions a settlement that's being enforced. But the checklist is very specific: disputes about enforcing a settlement (not a decree). So if the motion doesn't mention a settlement, it's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Memorandum\" (Order/Opinion) document might have a court order about enforcement. But the Docket already has the orders listed. Wait, the Docket has the orders, but the actual text of the orders might be in the \"Memorandum\" document. Wait, the \"Memorandum\" is listed as [Order/Opinion], so it might contain the court's opinion, which could include details about settlements.\n\nWait, entry 46 in the Docket says \"ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order...\". So the court denied the TRO motion. But the checklist is about disputes over settlement enforcement, not TROs. So unless the denial of the TRO relates to a settlement, which it doesn't seem to.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The user has to choose between read_document or search_document_regex. Since the checklist item is specific, maybe using a regex search would be efficient. The key terms might be \"enforce settlement\", \"settlement enforcement\", \"motion to enforce settlement\", etc.\n\nSo, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"enforce(ment)? (settlement|settlement agreement)\" to find relevant sections. The pattern should be case-insensitive. Let's set up the regex to search all unvisited documents for that.\n\nThe available documents to search are the six unvisited ones. The pattern should target the checklist item. So, the next action should be to search the unvisited documents for the regex pattern related to settlement enforcement disputes.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"doc_names\": [\"Complaint\", \"Order/Opinion\", \"Pleading / Motion / Brief\", \"Pleading / Motion / Brief\", \"Pleading / Motion / Brief\", \"Pleading / Motion / Brief\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "doc_names": ["Complaint", "Order/Opinion", "Pleading / Motion / Brief", "Pleading / Motion / Brief", "Pleading / Motion / Brief", "Pleading / Motion / Brief"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8529, "completion_tokens": 1183, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Memorandum (which was listed as Order/Opinion but maybe the correct name is Memorandum), the Amicus Brief, Notice of Dismissal, Plaintiff's Memorandum, and Plaintiffs' Motion.\n\nThe regex search failed because the document name was incorrect. The error message says the available documents include \"Memorandum\" as a document, so the correct name is probably \"Memorandum\" instead of \"Order/Opinion\". The previous search used \"Order/Opinion\" which isn't a valid name, so that's why it failed.\n\nThe checklist item is about disputes over settlement enforcement. The Docket didn't have any mentions of settlement enforcement. The next step is to check other documents where such disputes might be mentioned. The Complaint might have the initial claims, but enforcement disputes are more likely in motions or orders related to settlement.\n\nThe \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (706 tokens) is a short document. The Docket entries 8 and 28 mention motions related to TRO and preliminary injunction, but not settlement enforcement. However, the user needs to look for specific mentions of \"enforce settlement\" or similar terms.\n\nThe regex pattern used before was \"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\", which is correct. But the document name was wrong. The correct document name for the Memorandum is \"Memorandum\" (as per the available documents list). So, the next logical step is to search the \"Memorandum\" document with the regex pattern to find any mentions of settlement enforcement.\n\nWait, the available documents list has \"Memorandum\" as [Order/Opinion], but the actual name might be \"Memorandum\". The error message from the previous search mentioned \"Order/Opinion\" as not found, but the correct name is \"Memorandum\". So, using \"Memorandum\" as the doc_name in the search_document_regex.\n\nAlternatively, since the user tried to search multiple documents but the pattern was applied to the wrong names, maybe search all documents using the correct doc names. But the tool allows searching a specific document by name. The correct document names are listed as:\n\n- Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief [Complaint]\n- Memorandum [Order/Opinion] → but the actual name is \"Memorandum\" (since the error said \"Order/Opinion\" not found, but the document is called \"Memorandum\" in the list)\n- The others have their names.\n\nSo, the next action should be to use search_document_regex on the \"Memorandum\" document with the pattern to find any mentions of settlement enforcement. The previous error was due to using the wrong document name, so correcting that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search all documents with the pattern. But the user has to choose one action. Since the Docket was already read and didn't have the info, and the other documents are unvisited, searching the \"Memorandum\" document first makes sense because it's a longer document (23k tokens) which might contain relevant content.\n\nWait, the \"Memorandum\" document is listed as [Order/Opinion], but the actual name is \"Memorandum\". So the correct doc_name is \"Memorandum\". The previous search used \"Order/Opinion\" which doesn't exist, hence the error.

The Docket entries mention motions for TRO, preliminary injunctions, etc., but not settlements. The search for \"enforce\" and \"settlement\" didn't find anything. But maybe the other documents have the relevant info.\n\nThe next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain settlement enforcement disputes. The Complaint might have some, but the Docket already showed no settlement mentions. The Memorandum (Order/Opinion) might be a key document.

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item specifically asks for disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order), excluding disputes over decrees.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The snapshot shows that all checklist items are empty, and the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is the only one to extract. The documents available include Docket (fully visited), Memorandum (partially visited), and several unvisited documents.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, the user tried to search for \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" but got an error because \"Order/Opinion\" wasn't a valid document name. Then they read the Memorandum document up to 10,000 tokens. The Memorandum text provided is a legal document discussing a case about the CFPB funding, but I need to check if it mentions any disputes over settlement enforcement.\n\nReading through the Memorandum, I see sections about motions, orders, and the case's background. The key part is in the Docket entries. For example, entry 8 mentions a \"MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order\" and entry 46 says \"ORDER granting 44 Motion for Leave to File a supplemental reply and denying 8 Motion for a temporary restraining order, construed as a motion for preliminary injunction.\" But the checklist specifies excluding disputes over decrees (like stipulated judgments), and temporary restraining orders aren't settlements. The case was dismissed (entry 50: \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal\"), so no settlement enforcement disputes here.\n\nWait, the user needs to check if any document mentions disputes about enforcing a settlement. The Memorandum doesn't seem to have that. The Docket has entries like motions and orders, but none about settlements. The other unvisited documents might have relevant info. The \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" and \"Plaintiff's Memorandum\" could have more details, but the Memorandum already read (up to 10k tokens) doesn't show settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\". So, for example, if the parties reached a settlement agreement but one side is not complying, and there's a motion to enforce that agreement. But in the case, the motion was for a TRO, which is different from enforcing a settlement. The case was dismissed, so no settlement was reached. The motion to enforce a settlement isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, in the documents read so far (Docket and Memorandum), there's no mention of settlement enforcement disputes. The next step would be to check other documents. The available documents include \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\", \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"Plaintiff's Memorandum\", and \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". \n\nSince the Memorandum was partially read, maybe the remaining part has something, but the user read up to 10k tokens out of 23k, so maybe the rest has more info. But the problem is that the user's recent action was to read the Memorandum up to 10k tokens, and the text provided ends at page 16. The key is to see if any of the documents mention \"settlement\" in the context of enforcement. \n\nWait, the user tried to search for \"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" but the search was on the wrong document names. The correct approach now is to use `search_document_regex` on the remaining documents where the term might be present. The documents that are unvisited or partially visited are the ones to check. Since the Memorandum was partially visited, maybe the next step is to read the remaining tokens of the Memorandum or check other documents.\n\nBut the current status shows that the Memorandum is partially visited (43% covered), so maybe the term \"settlement\" appears in the remaining part. However, the user's previous search failed because of document name errors. Now, they should use the correct document names. The available documents list \"Memorandum\" as [Order/Opinion], but the actual name is \"Memorandum\" as per the catalog. Wait, in the catalog, the document is listed as \"Memorandum\" [Order/Opinion], but the user tried to search \"Order/Opinion\" which caused an error. So the correct name is \"Memorandum\" (without the bracketed part). \n\nSo, to search the Memorandum document for the regex pattern, the correct document name is \"Memorandum\". The previous search used \"Order/Opinion\" which isn't a valid name. So the next action should be to use `search_document_regex` on the document named \"Memorandum\" with the pattern \"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\".\n\nAlternatively, since the Memorandum was partially read, maybe the term is in the remaining tokens. But the user should first try to search the document for the pattern to find the relevant sections, then read those sections. However, the user's previous search attempt on \"Order/Opinion\" failed, so they need to use the correct document name.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Memorandum\" is the one they partially read. The other unvisited documents might have the term, but the most likely place is the Memorandum or the Motion documents. But the key is that the user needs to extract all instances of disputes over settlement enforcement. Since the case was about a TRO and preliminary injunction, and the motion was denied, there's no settlement mentioned. The dismissal (entry 50) was voluntary, so no settlement was part of the case.\n\nWait, the checklist says to exclude disputes over decrees (like stipulated judgments). So if there was a settlement agreement, that's different from a decree. But in this case, the case was dismissed without a settlement, so there's no settlement to enforce. Therefore, the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user has to confirm that there's no mention of any settlement enforcement dispute. The Docket and Memorandum don't mention it. The other documents might, but the user hasn't read them yet. However, the task is to extract from all documents. Since the user has read the Docket (fully) and the Memorandum (partially), and the other documents are unvisited, they need to check those.\n\nWait, but the user's current action should be based on the next step. The previous step was reading the Memorandum up to 10k tokens. Now, they need to check if there's any mention of settlement enforcement in the remaining part of Memorandum or in other documents.\n\nGiven that the user has already read the Docket (which has no such disputes) and the Memorandum (which in the provided text doesn't mention settlement enforcement), the next logical step is to search the Memorandum document for the regex pattern to see if the term appears in the remaining tokens. Since the Memorandum is partially visited, searching it for the regex would be efficient.\n\nSo the correct action is to use `search_document_regex` on the document named \"Memorandum\" with the pattern \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\". The document name should be \"Memorandum\" as per the catalog, not \"Order/Opinion\".\n\nThe previous error was due to using \"Order/Opinion\" as the document name, which isn't valid. The correct name is \"Memorandum\". So the next action should be to call `search_document_regex` with doc_name=\"Memorandum\" and the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has already read part of the Memorandum, but the regex search might find the pattern in the unvisited part.

The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents provided. \n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The snapshot shows that the checklist item is empty (0/1 values extracted), and the documents are mostly unvisited except for the Docket (fully visited) and Memorandum (partially visited up to 10k tokens). \n\nLooking at the recent actions: \n- Step 2 read the Docket (4878 tokens) but it's just a docket sheet with filings, motions, and orders—no settlement enforcement disputes mentioned. \n- Steps 3-6 tried regex searches on \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" but found nothing. The Memorandum (a legal brief) was read up to 10k tokens, but the text provided doesn't contain any settlement enforcement disputes. It's about a TRO motion, not settlement enforcement.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next action. The key requirement is to extract \"disputes about enforcing a settlement\" (e.g., motions to enforce, contempt motions), not disputes over decrees. The Memorandum and Docket don't mention settlements at all—they're about a preliminary injunction motion and administrative actions. \n\nThe available documents include:\n- Complaint (unvisited)\n- Amicus Brief (unvisited)\n- Notice of Dismissal (unvisited)\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum (unvisited)\n- Motion for TRO (unvisited)\n\nSince the regex search failed and the partial Memorandum reading didn't yield results, I should target the next most relevant document. The \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities\" (8,350 tokens) is likely to contain arguments about the motion, but the prior Memorandum (which was read) already covered the motion's context. However, the regex pattern didn't find anything, so maybe the term \"settlement\" isn't used in the expected way.\n\nWait—the checklist explicitly excludes disputes over decrees. The case seems to involve a TRO and preliminary injunction, not a settlement. The parties never settled; the case ended with a voluntary dismissal (Step 50). So there might be no settlement enforcement disputes at all. But I can't assume that yet; I need to check all documents.\n\nThe next logical step is to read the unvisited documents. The Complaint might mention settlement terms, but it's unlikely since it's a fresh lawsuit. The Amicus Brief could reference settlement discussions, but it's supporting the motion for preliminary injunction, not settlement enforcement. \n\nGiven that the regex search failed across all documents tried so far, and the current text doesn't contain settlement enforcement terms, the most efficient action is to read the next unvisited document that might contain relevant terms. The \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities\" (8,350 tokens) is the most likely candidate since it's a motion brief, but it's also unvisited. However, the user's prior action on \"Memorandum\" (which might be this document) already failed. Wait—the \"Memorandum\" in the catalog is listed as \"Order/Opinion\" type, but the one read was \"Memorandum\" (the court's opinion). The \"Plaintiff's Memorandum\" is a separate document.\n\nBut the snapshot says the Memorandum (court's opinion) was read partially (0-10k tokens), and the regex search on it found nothing. So now, I should read the next unvisited document: \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities\" (8,350 tokens). It's a pleading, so it might contain arguments about the motion, but settlement enforcement isn't expected. Still, I have to check.\n\nAlternatively, since the regex pattern didn't yield results, maybe the term \"settlement\" isn't used in the expected form. But the checklist requires \"enforcement disputes,\" so if no such disputes exist, I'd have to set it to \"Not Applicable.\" However, the rules say I can't mark it as Not Applicable without explicit evidence (e.g., \"no settlement was reached\" or \"case dismissed without settlement\"). The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (Step 50) says \"Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice,\" which implies no settlement was involved. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait—the case was dismissed voluntarily by plaintiffs, so there was no settlement. Therefore, \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" should be marked as Not Applicable. But I need to verify this in the documents. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (unvisited) might state \"without prejudice\" or similar, indicating no settlement. However, the prior actions didn't read it yet.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" The dismissal without prejudice doesn't necessarily mean no settlement was ever discussed—it just means the case was dismissed without a judgment. But in legal terms, a voluntary dismissal without prejudice typically means the case can be refiled, and no settlement was reached. So it's plausible that there were no settlement enforcement disputes because there was no settlement.\n\nHowever, to be safe, I should check the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal document. The document is small (1,199 tokens), so reading it would be efficient. If it says \"without prejudice\" and no settlement was mentioned, then I can set the key to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the current state shows all documents except Docket and Memorandum are unvisited. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is unvisited, and it's the smallest document. So the next logical step is to read that document to confirm whether a settlement was involved.\n\nWait—the checklist definition says: \"Exclude any disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" The case ended with a dismissal, not a decree, so no settlement enforcement disputes would exist. But I still need to confirm with evidence from the documents.\n\nThe safest action is to read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (since it's short and likely contains the dismissal reason) to see if it mentions settlement or dismissal without prejudice. If it says \"without prejudice\" and no settlement, then I can set the key to Not Applicable.\n\nSo, the next action should be `read_document` on \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" for the entire document (tokens 0-1199).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 1199\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1199}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19268, "completion_tokens": 1436, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state, and the checklist item is empty so far.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's been done. The previous steps included reading the Docket (fully visited), searching for \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" in several documents, but got errors or no matches. Then they read the Memorandum (partially visited, tokens 0-10000) and the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (fully visited). Both searches for the regex pattern didn't find anything.\n\nLooking at the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, it's a dismissal without prejudice. The document mentions Defendants' representations about not having a mechanism to transfer funds, but it doesn't talk about enforcing a settlement. The key here is that the checklist item specifically excludes disputes over decrees (like consent decrees) and wants disputes about enforcing a settlement (negotiated agreements, not court orders). The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal seems to be about the case being dismissed, not about enforcing a settlement. So no relevant info there.\n\nThe Memorandum (the court's opinion) also doesn't mention settlement enforcement. The case is about funding the CFPB, not a settlement. The motions mentioned are for preliminary injunction, not enforcement of a settlement.\n\nThe next step is to check the remaining unvisited documents. The available documents include the Complaint, the Amicus Brief, the Plaintiff's Memorandum, and the Motion for TRO. These might have more relevant content.\n\nThe user tried to search for \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" but got errors. The error was because the document name \"Order/Opinion\" wasn't in the list; the actual document is called \"Memorandum\" (which is the Order/Opinion document). So the search was done on the wrong document name. But the previous search on Memorandum found 0 matches. However, maybe the regex pattern needs to be adjusted. But the user already did that and got 0 matches.\n\nNow, the remaining unvisited documents are the Complaint, Amicus Brief, Plaintiff's Memorandum, and Motion for TRO. The Complaint (Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief) might have some references. The Motion for TRO (Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order) could mention settlements, but the case seems to be about funding, not a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement, which is a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order. The current case is about the CFPB's funding, so it's unlikely that there's a settlement involved here. The parties are dismissing the case voluntarily, but that's not a dispute over enforcement of a settlement.\n\nBut the user needs to check all documents. The next logical step is to read the Complaint, as it's the first document filed and might contain claims related to settlements. However, the Complaint's description says it's for injunctive and declaratory relief, not about a settlement. Still, to be thorough, maybe it's worth checking.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\". The user has to extract every distinct value. If there's no mention of settlement enforcement in any document, then the key should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user can't assume that yet; they have to check all documents.\n\nThe previous searches didn't find anything, but maybe the unvisited documents have the relevant info. The Complaint is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so reading it might be the next step. But the document is 6,497 tokens, which is under 10k, so it's okay to read the whole thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a regex search on the Complaint for \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" to see if there's a match. But the previous regex search on other documents didn't work, so maybe the pattern needs to be adjusted. But the user has to try.\n\nWait, the error in Step 3 was because the document name was wrong. The \"Order/Opinion\" document is actually named \"Memorandum\", so when they tried to search on \"Order/Opinion\", it wasn't found. Now, for the Complaint document, which is named \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", the correct document name to use in search_document_regex would be that exact name.\n\nBut the current available documents list shows \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" as the name, so the search should use that.\n\nHowever, the user's next action should be to either read a document or search. Since the Complaint is unvisited, and it's possible it contains the needed info, the best action is to read it. But to be efficient, maybe first do a regex search on the Complaint for the pattern, since the previous searches were done on the wrong documents.\n\nWait, the user tried to search on \"Complaint, Order/Opinion, ...\" which was incorrect. Now, for the Complaint document, they can use search_document_regex with the correct doc_name. The pattern is \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\".\n\nBut the previous regex search on Memorandum (which was correct) found 0 matches. So maybe the Complaint is the next candidate.\n\nAlternatively, read the Complaint entirely. Since it's 6,497 tokens, which is under 10k, reading it is acceptable.\n\nGiven that the user has to choose one action, and the Complaint is unvisited, the next step is to read the Complaint. So the action should be read_document on \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" from tokens 0-6497 (since it's 6,497 tokens, so 0-6497).\n\nWait, the document's token count is 6,497, so start_token 0, end_token 6497.\n\nSo the correct function call is read_document with doc_name \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", start_token 0, end_token 6497.\n\nThat's the next logical step. The other unvisited documents are also candidates, but starting with the Complaint makes sense as it's the first pleading.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 6497}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 6497}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15616, "completion_tokens": 1408, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes regarding enforcing a settlement, like motions to enforce, contempt, or requests for retained jurisdiction. Excluding disputes over decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty. The available documents include several that are fully visited, but there's a partially visited one: Memorandum (Order/Opinion) with 43% coverage. The user tried searching for \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\" but got zero matches. However, maybe the pattern wasn't precise enough.\n\nWait, the error in step 5 was because the document name was 'Order/Opi...' which is probably a typo. The actual document is called \"Memorandum\" in the catalog. So the search was on the wrong document name. But in step 6, they tried again on \"Memorandum\" and still got zero matches.\n\nNow, the user has read the Memorandum up to 10,000 tokens (partially visited), and the Complaint, Docket, and Notice of Dismissal are fully visited. The other three documents (Amicus Brief, Memorandum of Points, Motion for TRO) are unvisited.\n\nBut the key is to find disputes about enforcing settlements. The existing documents might not have that, but maybe the Amicus Brief or Motion for TRO has something. However, the user should check the partially visited document first. Wait, the Memorandum was partially read (43% coverage), so maybe there's more in the unvisited part. But the user already tried a regex search on it and got nothing.\n\nWait, the regex pattern used was \"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\". But the actual text in the Memorandum (from step 5) didn't have any matches. Let me check the provided text in the Memorandum. The text talks about the CFPB's funding, reserve funds, but not about settlement enforcement. The Complaint mentions \"settlement\" in the context of the CFPB's settlement with the Federal Reserve, but it's not about enforcing a settlement. The Notice of Dismissal says they're dismissing the case without prejudice because Defendants said there's no mechanism to transfer funds, but again, no settlement enforcement.\n\nWait, the checklist item specifically says \"exclude disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions)\". So maybe the case is about a settlement, but the disputes here are about funding, not about enforcing a settlement agreement. So perhaps there are no such disputes in the documents. But the user needs to confirm.\n\nWait, the user's prior search in Memorandum found zero matches. The Complaint and Notice of Dismissal don't mention settlement enforcement. The other unvisited documents might have something. The Amicus Brief (which is a brief supporting the motion for preliminary injunction) might mention settlement-related disputes. Similarly, the Motion for TRO or Memorandum of Points might.\n\nBut the user should check the unvisited documents. However, the decision policy says to read the document that's most likely to contain the target. Since the regex search on Memorandum (which is the largest document) didn't find anything, maybe the next step is to search the other documents.\n\nWait, but the user is supposed to choose one action. The available documents that are unvisited are the Amicus Brief, Memorandum of Points, and Motion for TRO. The user could search one of them. But the regex pattern might need to be adjusted. Wait, maybe the term is \"settlement enforcement\" but the documents use different phrasing. For example, \"enforce settlement\" vs \"settlement enforcement\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term is \"enforcement\" in the context of settlement. Let's look at the text in the Memorandum. The text mentions \"enforcement\" in the context of the CFPB's enforcement actions (e.g., \"CFPB’s vigorous enforcement efforts\"), but that's about the agency's own enforcement, not disputes over enforcing a settlement. So that's not relevant.\n\nThe Complaint says \"the Bureau’s complaint system\" but no mention of settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nThe Notice of Dismissal mentions \"the CFPB can reduce its reserve fund only by internally transferring reserve funds to use for operations.\" No mention of settlement.\n\nSo perhaps there are no such disputes in the corpus. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, we need explicit evidence. The user can't just say it's Not Applicable without evidence. So maybe the correct action is to set it as Not Applicable via update_checklist, but only if they've confirmed there's no evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", and the user has checked all documents (some fully visited, some partially). But the Memorandum was partially visited. Wait, the Memorandum has 23,031 tokens, and they read 0-10,000. The unvisited part is 10,001-23,031. Maybe the settlement enforcement is in the remaining part. But the regex search was done on the entire document (since it's a search_document_regex, which searches the whole document), but the error was due to the document name typo.\n\nWait, in step 5, the search was on \"Complaint, Order/Opinion, Pleading / Motion / Brief, Pleading / Motion / Brief, Pleading / Motion / Brief, Pleading / Motion / Brief\" which is a list of document types, but the actual document names in the catalog are different. The correct document for the Memorandum is \"Memorandum\" under Order/Opinion. So step 5's search was incorrect because they used a list of types, but the function expects document names. Then step 6 used \"Memorandum\" as the doc_name, which is correct.\n\nBut step 6's search found 0 matches. So the regex didn't find anything in the entire document. But the user only read 10,000 tokens of it. Wait, no: search_document_regex searches the entire document, regardless of what's been read. So if they did a search on the Memorandum document, it would have searched all 23k tokens, but the user had only read 10k. However, the search function would have processed the whole document. So if the search found 0 matches, that means there's no occurrence of the pattern in the entire document.\n\nTherefore, the Memorandum doesn't contain the required text. The other documents are fully visited, and their content (as per the provided text) doesn't mention settlement enforcement disputes. So there are no such disputes in the corpus.\n\nBut to confirm, the user should check if all documents have been properly searched. The Amicus Brief, Memorandum of Points, and Motion for TRO are unvisited. However, the user hasn't searched them yet. But the regex pattern might not be the right one. Maybe the term is \"settlement\" without \"enforcement\" or \"enforce\" in the pattern.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about \"disputes about enforcing a settlement\", so the key terms would be \"enforce\" or \"enforcement\" combined with \"settlement\" or \"settlement agreement\". The regex used was \"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\", which should capture \"enforce settlement\", \"enforcement settlement\", etc. If that didn't find anything, maybe there's no such text.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe the user should search the unvisited documents with the same regex. However, the decision policy says to choose one action. Since the user has already searched the Memorandum (which is the largest document) and found nothing, and the other documents are unvisited, perhaps the next step is to search the unvisited documents.\n\nBut the user's available actions include `search_document_regex` on specific documents. The unvisited documents are:\n\n- Brief of Amicus Curiae (11k tokens)\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points (8k tokens)\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO (706 tokens)\n\nThe Motion for TRO is small, so maybe search that first. But the pattern might not match. Alternatively, since the user is supposed to be systematic, maybe they should search all unvisited documents with the regex.\n\nBut the policy says to choose one action. So the next logical step would be to search the unvisited documents. Since the Motion for TRO is the smallest (706 tokens), maybe search that first. But the regex pattern might not apply to it.\n\nWait, the Motion for TRO (step 8) was the document the user read in step 8, but no, step 8 was reading the Complaint. The Motion for TRO is unvisited.\n\nWait, in the current status, the unvisited documents are:\n\n- Brief of Amicus Curiae [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 11,062 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 8,350 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 706 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSo the user should search one of these. But which one? The Motion for TRO is the smallest, so it's efficient to search that first. But the regex might not find anything. Alternatively, maybe the Amicus Brief is more likely to have legal arguments about settlement enforcement.\n\nBut according to the process, the next action should be to search the most likely document. Since the case is about CFPB funding, not settlement enforcement, it's possible there are no such disputes. But the user must check all documents.\n\nWait, but the user has already read the Complaint, Docket, Memorandum (partially), and Notice of Dismissal. The Memorandum was partially read, but the search was done on the whole document. So the search should have covered all tokens. So if the regex didn't find anything, there's nothing in the Memorandum.\n\nThe other documents might have the term. So the next step is to search the unvisited documents. But the user can only do one action at a time. So the best choice is to use `search_document_regex` on the unvisited documents with the same pattern.\n\nBut the function parameters allow specifying doc_names (array) or doc_name='all'. Since there are three unvisited documents, the user can search all three with the same pattern. The tool call would be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"search_document_regex\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_names\": [\"Brief of Amicus Curiae\", \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points\", \"Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO\"],\n    \"pattern\": \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\"\n  }\n}\n\nBut the document names in the catalog are the keys, like \"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" which is long, but the catalog lists it as [Pleading / Motion / Brief]. Wait, the catalog shows the document name as \"Brief of Amicus Curiae...\" but in the available documents list, it's listed as \"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York...\" under [Pleading / Motion / Brief]. So the actual doc_name is that long string, but the catalog might use a short name. However, the user's previous actions used the short names like \"Memorandum\" for the Order/Opinion document.\n\nWait, in the available documents, the names are listed as:\n\n- **Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief** [Complaint] - 6,497 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\n- **Docket** [Docket] - 4,878 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\n- **Memorandum** [Order/Opinion] - 23,031 tokens - ◐ Partially Visited\n- **Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 1,199 tokens - ✓ Fully Visited\n- **Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 11,062 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 8,350 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 706 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSo the actual doc_name for the Amicus Brief is the long title, but the user can refer to it by the short name they used before. Wait, in the previous steps, when they did `read_document` on \"Memorandum\", the catalog lists it as \"Memorandum\" under [Order/Opinion]. So the doc_name is \"Memorandum\" for that document. Similarly, the Amicus Brief's doc_name is the full title, but the user might have to use the exact name.\n\nBut the user's step 5 tried to search on a list of document types, which was wrong. The correct way is to use the actual document names. So for the Amicus Brief, the doc_name is the full title as listed. However, in the available documents list, the name is given with the brackets, but the actual doc_name in the system is the full title.\n\nBut in the tool call, the parameters require the document name. So for the Amicus Brief, the doc_name is \"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nBut that's very long. However, the user might have to use it as is. Alternatively, the catalog might have a shorter name, but according to the provided info, it's listed as that.\n\nBut to save time, the user can search all three unvisited documents by their short names as listed in the catalog. Wait, the catalog lists them as:\n\n- **Brief of Amicus Curiae...** [Pleading / Motion / Brief]\n- **Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points...** [Pleading / Motion / Brief]\n- **Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order** [Pleading / Motion / Brief]\n\nSo the doc_names for the search would be:\n\n- \"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"\n- \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"\n- \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"\n\nBut writing all that in the tool call is cumbersome. However, the tool's parameters require the exact document name. So the user should use the full names as listed.\n\nBut given that the user's previous actions used \"Memorandum\" as the doc_name for the Order/Opinion document, which matches the catalog's \"Memorandum\", it's safe to assume that for the other documents, the doc_name is the short title they're given. Wait, no. In the catalog, it's listed as:\n\n**Brief of Amicus Curiae...** [Pleading / Motion / Brief]\n\nSo the actual doc_name is the full title, but in the system, it might be stored with that name. So the user has to use the full name.\n\nBut in practice, for the tool call, the user can specify the doc_names as the exact strings provided in the catalog. So the three unvisited documents have doc_names:\n\n1. \"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"\n2. \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"\n3. \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"\n\nSo the search_document_regex should have doc_names set to these three.\n\nBut the user's previous search in step 5 had an error because they used 'Order/Opi...' which was a typo. So now, they should use the correct doc_names.\n\nThus, the next action should be to search these three documents with the regex pattern.\n\nBut the user can only do one action. So the correct step is to call `search_document_regex` with doc_names as the three unvisited documents and the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is sure there's no such text, but they need to confirm, they have to search. Since the user has to be systematic, they should search the unvisited documents.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to search the three unvisited documents with the regex.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_names\": [\"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"], \"pattern\": \"enforce(ment)?\\\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\"}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order"], "pattern": "enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 22479, "completion_tokens": 3996, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires identifying disputes about enforcing a settlement agreement, excluding disputes over decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, all documents have been partially or fully read. The Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (Complaint) was read in Step 8, and the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (Notice) was read in Step 7.

But the user's task is to extract disputes over settlement enforcement, not just the exact phrase. Maybe the term is used differently in the documents.\n\nLooking at the Complaint (Step 8), I see references to \"settlement\" but not in the context of enforcement disputes. For example, paragraph 40 mentions Vought seeking to transfer the reserve fund, but that's about funding, not settlement enforcement. The Memorandum (Step 5) talks about the Bureau's funding and the lawsuit, but again, no mention of settlement enforcement disputes. The Notice of Dismissal (Step 7) states that Defendants have repeatedly represented there's no mechanism to transfer funds, but again, not settlement-related.\n\nWait, the checklist item specifically excludes disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments). The case involves a motion for preliminary injunction, not a settlement. The parties voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal), so there's no settlement agreement being enforced here. The Complaint and Memorandum discuss the CFPB's funding and operations, not any settlement.\n\nThe key point is that the case is about defunding the CFPB, not enforcing a settlement. The parties aren't disputing a settlement; they're challenging the funding decision. So there are no disputes over settlement enforcement here. The correct action would be to mark this key as Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me check the documents again. The Complaint (Step 8) has claims under APA about defunding, not settlement enforcement. The Memorandum (Step 5) discusses the motion for injunction, not settlement. The Notice (Step 7) mentions voluntary dismissal, which is different from settlement enforcement. There's no mention of a settlement agreement in any of the documents.\n\nTherefore, there are no disputes over settlement enforcement. The item should be marked as Not Applicable. The evidence is the absence of any such disputes in the documents, supported by the fact that the case is about funding, not settlement enforcement. The Notice of Dismissal states the case was dismissed without prejudice, confirming no settlement was involved.\n\nSo the next action is to use update_checklist with the key Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement set to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the documents.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice.

The user is asking me to extract enforcement disputes related to settlements from legal documents. The checklist item is Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement, which requires extracting disputes about enforcing a settlement (not decrees). The prior steps have already tried searching and reading documents, but the latest update shows that Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement was set to \"Not Applicable\" based on evidence from the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Complaint.\n\nLooking at the current status: the key is marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The documents that have been fully visited don't have any matches for settlement enforcement disputes. The remaining documents are unvisited (Brief of Amicus, Memorandum, and two motions), but the search pattern used before (\"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\") didn't find anything in the previously read documents. However, the Memorandum is partially visited (43% covered), so maybe there's more to read there.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract every distinct value. The system has already set it to Not Applicable. But I need to check if there's any evidence in the remaining documents that might contradict this. The available documents include a Memorandum (partially visited) and three unvisited documents. The prior search on Memorandum with the regex found 0 matches, but maybe the unvisited part has something. However, the system's previous action (Step 6) searched Memorandum and found 0 matches. The user's step 7 read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, which was fully visited, and step 8 read the Complaint, fully visited.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys Marked as Not Applicable\" with 1 key. The extraction progress shows that the evidence provided for Not Applicable comes from the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (page 2) and Complaint (page 10). The Notice mentions \"Plaintiffs will undertake further actions if Defendants later transfer Bureau funds...\" which is a threat of future action, not an existing dispute. The Complaint talks about the APA violation but not a settlement enforcement dispute. The key point is that the checklist specifies to exclude disputes over decrees (consent decrees), and the case here is about defunding the CFPB, not enforcing a settlement.\n\nThe prior step (Step 10) used update_checklist to set Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence. The system now needs to verify if this is correct. The evidence provided in Step 10's update shows that the documents don't contain any disputes over settlement enforcement. The user's instructions say that Not Applicable must have explicit evidence. The Notice mentions \"Plaintiffs will undertake further actions,\" but that's not a dispute; it's a future possibility. The Complaint doesn't mention any settlement enforcement. So the Not Applicable is justified.\n\nNow, the next step: all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. The current status shows 1 key, all handled. The available documents have some unvisited ones, but since the checklist item is already marked as Not Applicable with valid evidence, there's no need to read more. The stop criteria say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's set to Not Applicable, the system should stop.\n\nWait, the user's current task is to extract enforcement disputes, and the system has determined it's Not Applicable. The evidence provided in the update (from Notice and Complaint) supports that there are no such disputes. The other documents might not have any either, but since the key is already set, no further action is needed. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully processed: Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement is marked Not Applicable with valid evidence from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice (Page 2) and Complaint (Page 10), confirming no enforcement disputes over settlements exist in the corpus.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are fully processed: Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement is marked Not Applicable with valid evidence from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice (Page 2) and Complaint (Page 10), confirming no enforcement disputes over settlements exist in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12469, "completion_tokens": 858, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract checklist items related to enforcement disputes over settlements from legal documents. The specific checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\".\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already marked this item as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from two documents: the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice and the Complaint. The evidence provided states that the case involves a request to enjoin defunding, not settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nThe key here is to confirm whether this is indeed the correct classification. The requirement says to exclude disputes over decrees (like consent decrees) and only include disputes about enforcing settlements (negotiated agreements not entered as court orders). \n\nIn the Complaint (page 10), it mentions \"the Acting Director's request of zero dollars... combined with an alleged decision and attempt to retur[ns]...\" which is about funding, not settlement enforcement. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal says plaintiffs dismiss without prejudice, with a conditional statement about future actions if funding is transferred - again, not about enforcing a settlement.\n\nThe system has already correctly identified that no settlement enforcement disputes exist in the corpus. The evidence provided supports this conclusion. There's no mention of any settlement agreements being enforced or disputed. The case is about funding the CFPB, not enforcing a settlement.\n\nThe document catalog shows all relevant documents have been fully visited (Complaint, Docket, Notice) or partially visited (Memorandum), but the search patterns used earlier (\"enforce(ment)?\\s+(settlement|settlement agreement)\") returned no matches. The Memorandum is partially visited but since the regex search found nothing, and the other documents are fully visited without relevant content, there's no need to read further.\n\nThe checklist summary shows \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is marked as Not Applicable with two supporting evidence entries. The stop criteria are met: the key is marked Not Applicable with proper evidence, and there are no other checklist items to process.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop, as all requirements are satisfied. The system has already done a thorough search and confirmed no relevant disputes exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully processed: Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement is marked Not Applicable with valid evidence from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice (Page 2) and Complaint (Page 10), confirming no enforcement disputes over settlements exist in the corpus.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are fully processed: Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement is marked Not Applicable with valid evidence from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice (Page 2) and Complaint (Page 10), confirming no enforcement disputes over settlements exist in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11421, "completion_tokens": 536, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
