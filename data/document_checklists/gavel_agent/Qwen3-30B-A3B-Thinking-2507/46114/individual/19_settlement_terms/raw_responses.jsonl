The only action possible here is to call list_documents because the catalog is unknown. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, use list_documents.

The user needs to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from legal documents. The checklist item is specific: only the non-court-ordered settlement terms, not those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. All documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), and the checklist key is empty. The task is to find all distinct terms in the documents that fit the criteria. Since the documents are all unvisited, the next logical step is to start reading one of them.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is a good starting point because it's the initial filing, which might mention settlement terms. But wait, the Complaint is a lawsuit, so it might not have settlement terms yet. Settlements usually come later, like in a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal or a Memorandum. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice (1,199 tokens) seems promising because dismissals without prejudice often include settlement terms as part of the agreement.\n\nWait, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might state that the case is dismissed based on a settlement. The key here is to check if the dismissal mentions specific terms. But the user said to extract terms not entered as court orders, so if the dismissal includes settlement terms, those are the ones to extract.\n\nSo, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice is the most likely document to contain the settlement terms. Let's read that first. The document is 1,199 tokens, so reading the entire document is feasible (since max is 10k tokens). \n\nI should use read_document on the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice, starting at token 0 to the end (1199). That way, I can check if it contains the relevant terms. If it does, then extract those terms with evidence. If not, move to the next document.\n\nWait, but the checklist requires \"substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement not entered as a court order.\" The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might mention settlement terms as part of the dismissal. For example, \"Plaintiffs and Defendants have reached a settlement agreement, which includes [terms]...\" So, reading that document first makes sense.\n\nSo the next action should be to read_document on \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" from start_token 0 to end_token 1199.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1199}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1199}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3501, "completion_tokens": 571, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from the legal documents. The current snapshot shows that they've already read the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" document, but it's fully visited (tokens 0-1199) and didn't contain any settlement terms. The checklist item is empty, and there are 6 other unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the document catalog is known. The previous steps show they used `list_documents` and found 7 documents, so the catalog is known. No need for `list_documents` again.\n\nNext, looking at the checklist item: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" refers to substantive obligations in a settlement not entered as a court order. The dismissal notice mentions Defendants' representations about fund transfers, but it's a dismissal without prejudice, not a settlement. So no settlement terms here.\n\nThe next logical step is to check other documents that might contain settlement terms. The available documents include a Complaint, Docket, Memorandum, Amicus Brief, and Motion for TRO. Settlement terms are more likely in a Complaint or a Memorandum (which might be an order or opinion), but the Memorandum is marked as \"Order/Opinion,\" which might contain court-ordered terms, but the checklist specifies to exclude court-ordered terms. Wait, the requirement says to exclude terms entered as court orders, so the Memorandum might have consent decrees, but the checklist wants non-court-ordered settlement terms.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So the Memorandum might have court-ordered terms, but the actual settlement terms (if any) would be in other documents, like a settlement agreement or a motion related to settlement.\n\nLooking at the document names: the Complaint is for injunctive and declaratory relief, so it might not have settlement terms. The Amicus Brief and Motion for TRO might not either. The Docket might list settlement entries, but the Docket is a log of filings, not the content.\n\nWait, the user needs to extract terms from documents where a settlement was reached. The dismissal notice was a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, so no settlement. The next step is to look for documents that might contain a settlement agreement. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" are likely about seeking injunctions, not settlements. The Amicus Brief might mention settlement terms if it's supporting a motion related to settlement, but that's less likely.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about settlement terms, so the actual settlement agreement document would be the one to look for. But in the provided documents, there's no obvious \"Settlement Agreement\" document. The available documents are all pleadings, motions, docket, and briefs. The Memorandum might be an order, but if it's a consent decree, that's court-ordered, so excluded. However, if there's a settlement agreement filed as a document, it might be listed under a different name.\n\nGiven that the current documents don't have a settlement agreement, maybe the settlement terms are referenced in another document. The \"Complaint\" might mention settlement terms if the parties settled before the complaint was filed, but that's unlikely. The Docket might show a settlement entry, but the Docket is a log, not the content. So perhaps the Docket document (4,878 tokens) needs to be read to see if it lists any settlement terms.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Memorandum\" (23,031 tokens) is marked as \"Order/Opinion,\" which might include a consent decree. But the checklist says to exclude court-ordered terms, so even if the Memorandum has terms, they shouldn't be included. So maybe the Memorandum isn't the right place.\n\nWait, the key is to find terms that are part of a settlement but not court-ordered. So the settlement agreement itself, which is a private document, might be filed as a separate document. But in the current document list, there's no such document. The \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" was read, and it's a dismissal, not a settlement. The other documents might not contain settlement terms. If none of the documents have settlement terms, then the checklist item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract all checklist items specified. The current status shows \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" is empty. To determine if it's Not Applicable, they need evidence that there's no settlement. However, the dismissal without prejudice doesn't necessarily mean there's no settlement; it's just a dismissal. But the problem states that the settlement terms are to be extracted, and if there's no settlement, then the item should be Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"A settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" So if there's a settlement agreement that's not part of a court order, it should be included. But if there's no settlement at all (like a dismissal without prejudice), then there are no settlement terms, so the item should be Not Applicable.\n\nBut how to confirm that? The dismissal notice says \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice,\" which implies no settlement was reached, just a dismissal. So the settlement terms don't exist here. But the user needs to check all documents to be sure.\n\nWait, the current state says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", so the checklist item is empty. The next step is to check other documents to see if any contain settlement terms. If after checking all documents, there are no settlement terms, then mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nThe available documents are all unvisited except the dismissal notice. So the next step should be to read another document. Which one? The Complaint might have some background, but settlement terms are unlikely. The Docket might have entries about settlement. The Docket is a log, so it might list if a settlement was filed. For example, the Docket might have a \"Settlement Agreement\" entry. So reading the Docket document (4,878 tokens) could be a good next step.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Memorandum\" (Order/Opinion) might have a settlement, but if it's a court order, the terms would be excluded. But maybe the Memorandum refers to a settlement agreement outside of the order. However, the user should check.\n\nGiven that the dismissal notice is the only one read, and it's a dismissal without prejudice, the next logical document to check for settlement terms would be the Docket, as it might list settlement-related filings. So using `read_document` on the Docket (tokens 0-4878, but since it's unvisited, read the whole thing as 4,878 tokens, which is under 10k).\n\nWait, the Docket has 4,878 tokens, which is less than 10k, so reading the entire document is allowed. So the next action should be `read_document` on \"Docket\" with start_token 0 and end_token 4878.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a regex search would be better to look for \"settlement\" in all documents. But the user is supposed to choose one action. Since the Docket is a good candidate for having settlement entries, reading it directly is safe.\n\nSo the correct next action is to read the Docket document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4878}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4878}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4842, "completion_tokens": 1643, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The current status shows 0 values extracted out of 1 required key.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal have been fully read (✓ Fully Visited), but they don't contain settlement terms. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal mentions dismissal without prejudice and references to CFPB's fund transfer limitations, but the instructions specify not to include court-ordered terms. The key here is that this is a voluntary dismissal, not a settlement with terms.\n\nThe remaining unvisited documents are all complaint/brief documents that might contain settlement terms. The Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (6,497 tokens) is the most likely candidate since complaints often outline claims and potential resolutions. The other briefs might reference settlement terms too, but the Complaint is the primary document.\n\nSince the checklist is empty and no documents have yielded the required term yet, the next logical step is to read the Complaint document. The user has to choose exactly one action, and reading the Complaint (unvisited, 6,497 tokens) is the most efficient path forward. I shouldn't use regex search here because the term is specific to settlement language that would be in the complaint body, not a pattern like \"Case No.\" \n\nNo other actions make sense: list_documents is unnecessary (catalog is known), get_checklist won't help since there's nothing to extract yet, and append/update would be premature. The stop condition isn't met since the key is empty.\n\nSo the correct action is read_document on \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" from tokens 0-6497 (all tokens since it's unvisited).

The user needs me to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from the legal documents provided. The checklist item is defined as the substantive obligations in a settlement that's not entered as a court order. So, I need to find any such terms in the documents.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The system says all three documents read so far (Complaint, Docket, Notice of Dismissal) are fully visited, but the checklist for Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is empty. The key is still empty, so I need to look for terms in the remaining unvisited documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are four unvisited ones: Memorandum (23k tokens), Amicus Brief (11k), Plaintiff's Memorandum (8.3k), and Motion for TRO (706 tokens). The Motion for TRO is small, so maybe start there. But wait, the Motion for TRO is a brief, and the Notice of Dismissal mentions a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The key here is to check if there's any settlement terms in any of these documents.\n\nWait, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (which was read) says: \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice against Defendants... If Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their repeated representations... Plaintiffs will undertake further actions as appropriate.\" But this isn't a settlement; it's a dismissal without prejudice. So no settlement terms here.\n\nThe Complaint (read) talks about the CFPB's funding and the lawsuit, but no settlement terms. The Docket lists court filings, but no settlement language.\n\nNow, the unvisited documents. The Motion for TRO (706 tokens) is probably a request for a temporary restraining order, not a settlement. The Amicus Brief and Plaintiff's Memorandum might contain settlement terms if they were part of a settlement agreement. But the user's task is to extract settlement terms from the documents. However, the case was dismissed without prejudice, so maybe there was no settlement. But the checklist requires extracting terms if they exist.\n\nWait, the Notice of Dismissal mentions \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice,\" which implies no settlement was reached. The dismissal was voluntary, so the case was closed without a settlement. Therefore, there might not be any settlement terms. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, I need to confirm if there's evidence that the item is Not Applicable.\n\nThe Not Applicable should be set via update_checklist with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence here would be the dismissal without prejudice, indicating no settlement was made. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal states that the action is dismissed without prejudice, so there's no settlement agreement. Therefore, the checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check if any of the unvisited documents mention a settlement. The Motion for TRO (706 tokens) might be part of the motion, but it's a request for a temporary order, not a settlement. The other documents like the Amicus Brief might discuss the case but not a settlement. Since the case was dismissed without prejudice, there's no settlement, so the item should be Not Applicable.\n\nSo, the next step is to use update_checklist to set Significant_Terms_of_Settlement to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Notice of Dismissal. The evidence would be the text in the Notice stating the voluntary dismissal without prejudice, which implies no settlement terms exist.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" Since there's no settlement, it's Not Applicable. The evidence should be the dismissal without prejudice.\n\nIn the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, the text says: \"Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice against Defendants...\" So the case is dismissed without any settlement terms. Therefore, Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is Not Applicable.\n\nThus, I should call update_checklist with the key set to \"Not Applicable\" and the evidence from the Notice of Dismissal.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), Plaintiffs Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and Economic Action Maryland Fund hereby give notice that the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice against Defendants Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Russell Vought.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1, line 12\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"On the basis of these representations, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice.
