The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents.

The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all keys are empty, and there are 6 unvisited documents. The previous step was list_documents, which found 6 documents. Now, I need to find where the filing date might be. Typically, in legal documents, the filing date is often on the complaint or docket.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint\" and \"Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" (which is a type of complaint), and \"Docket\". The Docket usually lists the filing date, but sometimes the complaint itself has the date. The \"Opinion and Order\" might have dates too, but the filing date is more likely in the complaint or docket.\n\nSince the Docket is a smaller document (3,883 tokens), it's a good candidate to check first. The filing date is probably listed there. But maybe the Complaint also has it. However, the Docket is more likely to have the initial filing date.\n\nThe user mentioned to use search_document_regex if the target is patternable. The filing date might follow a pattern like \"Filed: [date]\" or \"Date Filed: [date]\". So a regex search could efficiently find those instances.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Docket might have a \"Filed\" entry. Let me consider using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"Filed:|Date Filed:\" to find potential matches. The document names are listed, so searching all documents might be efficient, but maybe start with the Docket since it's the most relevant.\n\nWait, the Docket is specifically named [Docket], which is likely to contain the filing date. But the regex search can be done across all documents to cover all possibilities. However, the user's instruction says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The pattern here is clear: \"Filed:\" followed by a date.\n\nSo, the next action should be to search all documents for \"Filed:\" using search_document_regex. The pattern would be \"Filed: [^\\n]*\" to capture the date after \"Filed:\". But maybe just \"Filed:\" as the pattern, since the date follows. Let's use a regex pattern like \"Filed: ([^\\n]+)\" to capture the date.\n\nWait, the regex parameters allow for a pattern. The pattern should be precise. Let's use \"Filed:\\s*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}-\\d{1,2}-\\d{4})\" but maybe simpler. Since the exact format isn't known, perhaps just \"Filed: \" and then take the next part. But the regex might need to be adjusted. However, the instructions say to use precise, anchored patterns. So maybe \"Filed:\\s*\" as the pattern, then in the results, the context around it will show the date.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be \"Filed: \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" to match common date formats. But to be safe, use \"Filed:\" as the pattern and let the context tokens around it capture the date.\n\nSo, the next step is to call search_document_regex with pattern \"Filed:\" and doc_name set to \"all\" to search all documents. That should quickly find where the filing date is mentioned.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all documents as unvisited, so searching all makes sense. The Docket is likely to have the filing date, but the Complaint might also have it. But using regex search across all documents is efficient.\n\nSo the correct action here is to use search_document_regex with pattern \"Filed:\" and search all documents. Then, from the search results, read the context to get the exact date and evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Filed:\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Filed:", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3341, "completion_tokens": 862, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done two steps: list_documents and search_document_regex with the pattern \"Filed:\" across all documents, but found 0 matches.\n\nHmm, so the regex search for \"Filed:\" didn't find anything. Maybe the term isn't exactly \"Filed:\" in the documents. Maybe it's written out like \"Filed on\" or \"Filing Date\" or something else. The checklist definition says it's the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed. So the term might not be \"Filed:\" exactly.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket document might have the filing date. Dockets usually list the dates when things were filed. The other documents are Complaints, Opinions, Briefs, which might mention the date but not necessarily in the \"Filed:\" format. But the regex search used \"Filed:\" which might not match.\n\nSo the next step should be to read the Docket document because it's most likely to have the filing date. The Docket is listed as 3,883 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is possible. Since it's unvisited, I should use read_document on the Docket.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the search for \"Filed:\" found 0 matches. Maybe the actual text uses \"Filed\" without the colon, or maybe it's in a different format. But the Docket is the best place to look. Let's check the Docket document first. So the action should be read_document on the Docket file.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3883}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3883}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3371, "completion_tokens": 372, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Jury Trial Requested: No. Filed by Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities against All Defendants (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Proposed Summons). (Sortun, Anna) (Entered: 05/15/2025)\".\n\nSo the date here is 05/15/2025, which is May 15, 2025. The Filing_Date should be that date. The Checklist item is Filing_Date, and the requirement is to extract every distinct value. Since the Docket entry shows \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", that's the filing date. The document was fully visited, so no need to read it again. The next step is to append this value to the checklist.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that in Step 3, they read the Docket document (tokens 0-3883) and found that entry. So the evidence is in the Docket document. The Filing_Date key is empty, so we need to add this value. The evidence should include the text snippet, source document, and location. The location here would be the specific line in the Docket. The text is \"Entered: 05/15/2025\" from the Complaint entry.\n\nThe checklist item Filing_Date needs to have this value added. Since it's the first value, we should use append_checklist to add it. The parameters for append_checklist require a patch with key \"Filing_Date\" and an extracted array containing the evidence and value. The value should be \"2025-05-15\" or \"05/15/2025\"? The example in the Docket uses \"05/15/2025\", but the checklist might prefer a standard format. However, the requirement says to use the verbatim snippet, so the evidence text should be \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", and the value can be the date as presented. But the checklist item definition says \"calendar date\", so maybe standardize it. However, the instructions say to include the verbatim text as evidence, so the value should be exactly as in the document. Wait, the value in the extracted entry is the actual value, not the evidence. The evidence includes the text. So the value would be \"05/15/2025\", and the evidence text is the \"Entered: 05/15/2025\" part.\n\nWait, looking at the example in the tools, the value is the extracted value, and the evidence has the text. So for the Filing_Date, the value should be the date string, and the evidence includes the text where it was found. So the value is \"05/15/2025\", and the evidence text is \"Entered: 05/15/2025\".\n\nSo the append_checklist should have key \"Filing_Date\", extracted array with one entry: evidence with text \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", source_document \"Docket\", location \"Entry 1 in Docket\".\n\nThe Docket document is fully visited, so we can't read it again, but since we already read it, we can use the evidence from that read.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append_checklist with the Filing_Date value from the Docket.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"05/15/2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Entered: 05/15/2025\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Entry 1 (Complaint)\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "05/15/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Entered: 05/15/2025", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Entry 1 (Complaint)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7404, "completion_tokens": 953, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. So far, they've done some steps.\n\nIn Step 1, they listed documents and found 6.

In the Docket, entry 1 says \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", so they extracted that as the Filing_Date.

But the checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed. The Docket's entry 1 is the Complaint, which is the initial filing. The other documents like Amended Complaint, Opinion, etc., are later filings. So the Filing_Date should only be the first date, which is 05/15/2025.\n\nWait, but the user is supposed to extract every distinct value. But the initial filing date is only one. The other entries in the Docket are subsequent events. For example, entry 6 is Amended Complaint on 06/11/2025, but that's an amendment, not the original filing. So the Filing_Date should only be the first date.\n\nThe Docket is fully visited, so no need to read it again. The other documents (Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc.) might have the date, but the original filing date is already captured. The Amended Complaint's date is a later event, not the filing date.

The checklist has only one item, Filing_Date, and it's already filled with one value. The system shows 1/1 keys with values, so all keys are filled. Therefore, the next step should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user needs to make sure there are no other values. The regex search for \"Filed:\" found nothing, but maybe the actual filing date isn't in \"Filed:\" but in \"Entered:\" as in the Docket. The Docket's entry 1 has \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", which is the filing date. The other entries like \"Filed by...\" don't have the date. So the only value is 05/15/2025.\n\nSince the checklist item is complete (one value, which is correct), and no other documents are needed because the original filing is already found in the Docket, the correct action is to stop.
