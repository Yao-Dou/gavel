We ask the Court to stop this imminent threat to our Nation's historic and critical support of the humanities by enjoining NEH from fundamentally altering the Federal/State Partnership, antithetical to Congressional intent, and in violation of Congress's instructions in its annual appropriations bills for the agency."
