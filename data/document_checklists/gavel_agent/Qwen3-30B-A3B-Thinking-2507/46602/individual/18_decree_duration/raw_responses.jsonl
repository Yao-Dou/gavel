The user provided a snippet of the document, but it's mostly the introduction and background. The relevant part for the decree duration would likely be in the \"Preliminary Injunction\" section or the \"Conclusion\" part, where the court orders specific relief.\n\nLooking at the provided text, the document mentions \"the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion and enters a preliminary injunction and stay.\" But there's no explicit mention of the duration of the decree. The text talks about the injunction being granted, but the duration isn't specified in the excerpt. The user needs to find where the court states how long the decree will last.\n\nSince the current read only covers up to page 19 (tokens 0-10000), maybe the duration is mentioned later. The document is 47,462 tokens long, so there's more to read. The next step would be to read the next token range of the Opinion and Order to find the decree duration.\n\nThe user should use `read_document` on Opinion and Order for the next unvisited tokens. The previous read was 0-10000, so the next range could be 10000-20000. They need to check if the decree duration is in that section. The document's \"Preliminary Injunction\" section starts around page 80, but the text provided stops at page 19. Wait, the page numbers in the document show that page 19 is still early, so the relevant part might be later.\n\nWait, the document's page numbers in the text: the first page is page 1, and the current read goes up to page 19. The \"Preliminary Injunction\" section is listed on page 80, so the actual order might be in the later pages. But the user's current read is only up to token 10000, which covers up to page 19. So they need to read further into the document to find where the decree duration is specified.\n\nThe correct action here is to call `read_document` for the Opinion and Order, starting at token 10000 and ending at 20000 (since 10,000 tokens per call). This will cover the next part of the document where the decree details might be. The user shouldn't use `search_document_regex` yet because the duration is likely a specific phrase like \"duration of the decree\" or \"injunction shall remain in effect until\" etc., but without knowing the exact wording, it's safer to read the next section.\n\nAlso, checking the available documents, Opinion and Order is the most likely place to find the decree, as it's the court's order.

Let me check the relevant sections.\n\nIn the document, there's a part where the court discusses the preliminary injunction. On page 20, there's a termination letter from NEH that says \"effective April 2, 2025\". But that's about the grant termination, not a court decree. The court is granting a preliminary injunction, but I need to find the duration specified.\n\nWait, in the \"Preliminary Injunction\" section (page 80), the court might state the duration. Let me check the text. The document mentions \"the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion and enters a preliminary injunction and stay.\" But does it specify how long the injunction lasts?\n\nLooking through the text again, I don't see a specific duration mentioned. The injunction is granted, but the duration isn't stated in the excerpts provided. The court might have set a duration, but it's not in the text we've read so far. The text stops at the end of the \"Separation of Powers\" discussion.\n\nThe user has read up to token 20000, which is about page 36. The actual injunction duration might be in the later parts of the document, but the provided text cuts off there. The document is 47,462 tokens, so there's more to read beyond 20000 tokens.

The checklist item requires extracting the duration of decree obligations from court orders, like injunctions or consent decrees. The key is to find any formal court-ordered obligations, not just negotiated agreements.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the main one read so far is \"Opinion and Order\" (tokens 0-30000). The user has already done three read_document actions on this document. I need to check if any part of this text mentions a decree duration.\n\nScanning through the text, I notice that the document is an opinion and order granting a preliminary injunction. The court is discussing whether the defendants violated the Separation of Powers doctrine, APA, and ICA. The court mentions \"preliminary injunction\" multiple times, but I need to find the specific duration of this decree.\n\nWait, in the text, I see: \"For the reasons explained below, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion and enters a preliminary injunction and stay.\" But it doesn't specify the duration. The court says \"preliminary injunction\" which typically lasts until the final judgment, but the exact duration isn't stated here.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of the injunction's duration later in the document. Let me scan more carefully.\n\nLooking at the text again, I don't see any specific duration mentioned. The court discusses the injunction but doesn't state how long it will last. It's a preliminary injunction, which usually remains in effect until the case is resolved, but the document doesn't specify a fixed duration.\n\nThe user's instructions say: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\" But if there's no specific duration mentioned, I can't invent one. I need to look for explicit mentions.\n\nChecking all the sections again, I don't see any mention of a specific duration like \"until December 31, 2025\" or \"for five years.\" The court is granting a preliminary injunction, which is temporary, but the exact term isn't specified in the provided text.\n\nSince the document doesn't contain the decree duration, I need to consider if there are other documents that might have this information. The available documents include \"Amended Complaint,\" \"Complaint,\" \"Docket,\" and others. The Docket might have the actual order with the duration, but the user hasn't read it yet.\n\nWait, the \"Opinion and Order\" is the document that would contain the court's ruling, including the injunction terms. If the duration isn't in the provided text (tokens 0-30000), maybe it's in the next token range. But the user has read up to token 30000, and the document is 47,462 tokens long, so there's more to read.\n\nHowever, the user's recent actions show they've read tokens 0-10000, 10000-20000, and 20000-30000. The next step would be to read the remaining tokens (30000-47462) to see if the duration is mentioned later.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents.\" The \"Opinion and Order\" is marked as \"◐ Partially Visited\" with 63% coverage (30000/47462). So the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens (30000-47462) to check for the decree duration.\n\nI should use `read_document` for tokens 30000-47462 of \"Opinion and Order\" to see if the duration is mentioned there. Since the document is 47,462 tokens, and 30,000 have been read, the remaining is about 17,462 tokens. But the maximum allowed per call is 10,000 tokens. So I'll need to split it into two reads: 30000-40000 and 40000-47462.\n\nHowever, the user's current state shows they've read up to 30000, so the next read should be 30000-40000 (10,000 tokens).

Defendants' April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs' previously approved grants was unlawful and Defendants are enjoined from implementing those terminations as to grants awarded to either Plaintiffs Oregon Council for the Humanities d/b/a Oregon Humanities or the Federation of State Humanities Councils, including all member Councils of the Federation;\n2. Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs' grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) or further Order of the Court; and\n3. Defendants shall not obligate, loan, encumber, disburse, or otherwise dispose of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\n\nAPA STAY\nThe Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants National Endowment for the Humanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs' grants and from disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\n```\n\nI see that the court has issued a preliminary injunction and an APA stay, but I don't see a specific duration mentioned for these orders. The court says \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nThis suggests the duration is \"until the Court orders otherwise\" or \"until the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate.\"\n\nHowever, let me check the Amended Complaint document for any mentions of decree durations.\n\nFrom the Amended Complaint (tokens 0-20000), I see the plaintiffs are asking for \"a preliminary injunction\" and \"a stay under § 705 of the APA\", but I don't see any specific mention of a duration for the decree.\n\nThe Amended Complaint states:\n```\nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter both a stay under § 705 of the APA and a preliminary injunction against all Defendants.\n```\n\nBut it doesn't specify the duration of the decree.\n\nLet me check the Opinion and Order document again for more details on the duration. I need to see if there's any mention of a specific time period for the injunction or stay.\n\nI don't see a specific time period mentioned in the text provided. The duration seems to be \"until the Court orders otherwise\" or \"until the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate.\"\n\nFor the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", the value would be \"until the Court orders otherwise\" or \"until the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure this is a formal court order or judgment (decree), and not just a negotiated agreement. The Opinion and Order document is the court's formal decision, so it qualifies.\n\nLet me check if there's any other mention of duration in the documents:\n\nIn the Amended Complaint (tokens 0-20000):\n```\nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter both a stay under § 705 of the APA and a preliminary injunction against all Defendants.\n```\n\nNo specific duration mentioned.\n\nIn the Opinion and Order document (tokens 0-47462):\n```\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\n```\n\nThis clearly states the duration of the preliminary injunction: \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nSimilarly, for the APA Stay:\n```\nThe Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants National Endowment for the Humanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs' grants and from disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\n```\n\nThis doesn't explicitly state a duration, but it's clear from the context that it's \"until the Court orders otherwise\" or \"until the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate.\"\n\nSo, the duration for the decree (the preliminary injunction) is \"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nI should extract this as the value for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\".\n\nLet me check if there are any other decrees or orders with specific durations mentioned in the documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, I don't see any other decrees or orders with specific durations mentioned. The main decree in the documents is the preliminary injunction and the APA stay, which have the duration I identified.\n\nNow, I need to create an entry for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with the value \"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\" I need to provide evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nLet me format the evidence:\n\n- `text`: \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\"\n- `source_document`: \"Opinion and Order\"\n- `location`: \"Page 80-81, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION section\"\n\nI should use `update_checklist` to set the value for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" since this is a single value for the decree duration.\n\nLet me check the requirements for `update_checklist`:\n- \"REPLACES the entire extracted list for specified keys.\"\n- \"Use when you have the complete, authoritative set or to correct prior entries.\"\n- \"Also use this to set a key to Not Applicable (encoded as a single extracted entry with value 'Not Applicable').\"\n\nSince this is the first and only value for this key, I'll use `update_checklist` to set the value.\n\nThe evidence needs to be formatted as:\n```json\n{\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"verbatim text\",\n      \"source_document\": \"document name\",\n      \"location\": \"location in document\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"value\": \"duration value\"\n}\n```\n\nSo for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", I'll have:\n```json\n{\n  \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 80-81, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION section\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"value\": \"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLet me double-check that this meets the requirements:\n- It's a single value for the decree duration.\n- The evidence includes verbatim text, source document, and location.\n- The value is formatted as requested: \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\" - but since the duration is \"until the Court orders otherwise\", and the decree obligation is the preliminary injunction, I'm using the full duration statement as the value.\n\nActually, the value should be formatted as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". In this case, the decree obligation is the preliminary injunction, and the duration is \"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nSo the value should be:\n```\n\"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction: Preliminary Injunction\"\n```\n\nWait, let me re-read the requirement: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\"\n\nSo the format should be:\n```\n\"[duration]: [decree obligation]\"\n```\n\nFor this case, the duration is \"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\" and the decree obligation is \"Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nSo the value should be:\n```\n\"until the Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction: Preliminary Injunction\"\n```\n\nLet me check the evidence again to make sure it's accurate:\n\nFrom the document:\n```\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\n```\n\nSo the duration is \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\" and the decree obligation is \"Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nTherefore, the value should be:\n```\n\"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction: Preliminary Injunction\"\n```\n\nI'll use this value.\n\nNow, let's format the `update_checklist` call:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 80-81, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION section\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"value\":

this Preliminary Injunction: Preliminary Injunction\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis should be the correct value for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\".\n\nI'll now output the

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. From the provided snapshot, I see that in Step 9, they already used `update_checklist` to add one value from the Opinion and Order document. The extracted value is \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction\" from page 80-81 of the Opinion and Order.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: all keys (only one key here) have been filled with a value. The checklist summary shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\". The document catalog shows Opinion and Order is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and the other documents are either partially visited or unvisited, but since we've already extracted the only required value, there's no need to read more documents.\n\nThe Not Applicable section is 0/1, meaning we don't have any keys marked as Not Applicable. The extraction progress shows 1 value extracted, which matches the single checklist item. The user's task was to extract every distinct value for this item, and we've found one value that's clearly stated in the court's order.\n\nSince all checklist items are filled with evidence (we have one value with source document and location), and there are no empty keys left, the stop condition is met. I don't need to call any more functions. The next step is to return the stop decision with a brief reason.\n\nI should make sure there's no other document that might contain additional values for this key. But the document catalog shows Opinion and Order is fully visited, and the other documents (Complaint, Docket, etc.) don't seem relevant to decree duration. The extracted value comes directly from the court's injunction terms, which is exactly what the checklist requires. No need to search further.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop, as all requirements are satisfied.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. From the provided context, I see that the system has already processed several documents and made an update.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 9 was an `update_checklist` for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with one value extracted from the Opinion and Order document (pages 80-81). The value given is: \"until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nThe system then called `stop` at Step 10, but the automatic `get_checklist` after that shows the key is filled with 1 value. The current status says 1/1 keys are filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable.\n\nI need to verify if this is the only relevant value. The checklist definition specifies to extract \"every distinct value\" of the decree duration from any formal court order. The value found is from the PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION section of the Opinion and Order, which is a court-ordered decree.\n\nChecking the document coverage: \"Opinion and Order\" is fully visited (100% coverage), so no need to read more of it. The other documents are partially or unvisited, but the decree duration should be in the court order, not in complaints or motions. The Amended Complaint (partially visited) doesn't mention decree duration—it's about the complaint itself, not the court's order.\n\nThe extracted value seems correct and complete. The \"until this Court orders otherwise\" phrase is standard for preliminary injunctions, meaning it lasts until the court changes it or the parties agree to modify it. There's no indication of a fixed duration (like \"for 5 years\"), so this is the only value to extract.\n\nNo other documents seem likely to contain this specific decree duration. The other documents are motions or complaints that wouldn't include the court's decree terms. The system has already processed the relevant document thoroughly.\n\nThe checklist status shows 1/1 keys filled, so all required items are extracted. The value has proper evidence (page 80-81 of the Opinion and Order). There's no need for further actions—no empty keys, no Not Applicable needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop now, as all requirements are met.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted: 'How_Long_Decrees_will_Last' has one value from Opinion and Order (pages 80-81) with complete evidence.
