All other actions like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct move here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. That's the only logical step before proceeding further.

The user needs to extract four specific items from legal documents, and currently, all are empty. The documents are listed, all unvisited. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document to start with. The checklist items are Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, and Type_of_Counsel. \n\nFiling_Date probably appears in the Docket or the Complaint. Dockets usually have the filing date. The Docket document is 3,883 tokens, which is the smallest, so it's a good candidate to start with. But the user mentioned that the Docket is unvisited, so I should read that first.\n\nWait, the Docket might have the filing date. The Complaint might have the parties and class action info. But since Filing_Date is the first item, and the Docket is the most likely place for that, I should read the Docket first. The Docket is small, so reading it entirely would be efficient. But the system says not to read more than 10k tokens, and it's 3.8k, so safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint has the filing date. But Dockets usually list the date the case was filed. So Docket is better. Let's go with read_document on Docket, start_token 0, end_token 3883 (since it's the whole document). \n\nWait, the document catalog shows Docket as 3,883 tokens, so reading the whole thing makes sense. No need for regex here since it's a small document. So the next action should be read_document for Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3883}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3883}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3572, "completion_tokens": 392, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract four checklist items from the legal case documents. The current status shows all keys are empty. The documents available include the Docket, which has already been fully read (tokens 0-3883), and five other documents that are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should check what's in the Docket since it's the only one fully read. The Docket entries show the initial filing. Entry 1 mentions the Complaint filed on 2025-05-15 by Federation of State Humanities Councils against All Defendants. So the Filing_Date should be 2025-05-15. That's one key done.\n\nNext, Who_are_the_Parties. The Complaint in Entry 1 lists the plaintiffs as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities, and the defendants as All Defendants. But Entry 6 mentions Amended Complaint against Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service. So the parties are Plaintiffs: Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities; Defendants: Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service. Need to format as 'Plaintiff: [description]' and 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: The Complaint says \"Complaint\" without mentioning class action. Entry 1 says \"Filing fee... Agency Tracking ID... Filer is subject to Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1.\" Fed R. Civ. P. 7.1 is about disclosures for corporations, not class actions. The Amended Complaint in Entry 6 doesn't mention class action either. So probably Individual Plaintiffs. But the checklist says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description would be the plaintiff names. Wait, but the initial complaint lists the plaintiffs as organizations. So maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" isn't right. Wait, the plaintiffs are organizations, so they're not individuals. Wait, the checklist says \"Class Action or Individual Plaintiffs\". If it's not a class action, it's individual. But the plaintiffs are organizations, so maybe it's \"Individual\" but the description would be the organizations. Wait, the example says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So if they're not a class, it's Individual, and the description is the plaintiff entities. So \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: In Entry 1, the filer is Sortun, Anna. Entry 7 has \"Filed by All Plaintiffs\" and \"Sortun, Anna\". Entry 24 mentions State of Oregon, etc., with Howell, Coby. Entry 26 says \"Notice of Appearance of Coby Healy Howell appearing on behalf of State of Oregon\". So counsel for plaintiffs is Sortun, Anna (private counsel?), and amicus states have Howell and Jamieson. But the checklist is for each party. The main parties' counsel: Plaintiffs' counsel is Sortun, Anna (private counsel?), and Defendants' counsel is Martin, Sean (from Entry 29). So Type_of_Counsel should be \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel (Sortun, Anna)\", \"Defendants: Private counsel (Martin, Sean)\", and Amicus: \"Amicus: Government counsel (Howell, Coby; Jamieson, Keith)\".\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Type_of_Counsel: The category of legal representation for each party (e.g., private counsel, legal services/public defender, public interest organization such as the ACLU, government counsel).\"\n\nSo for each party, list the counsel type. Plaintiffs' counsel: Sortun, Anna (private counsel). Defendants' counsel: Martin, Sean (private counsel). Amicus states: Howell and Jamieson (government counsel, since they're state attorneys).\n\nBut the checklist item is for the parties in the case, so the main parties (plaintiffs and defendants), not the amici. So Type_of_Counsel would be Plaintiffs: Private counsel, Defendants: Private counsel. The amicus is separate but not a party, so maybe not included. Wait, the checklist says \"for each party\", so the main parties. So Plaintiffs' counsel is private, Defendants' is private.\n\nWait, in Entry 1, \"Filed by Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities against All Defendants (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Proposed Summons). (Sortun, Anna)\" — so Sortun is the attorney for the plaintiffs. Similarly, Defendants are represented by Martin, Sean (Entry 29: \"Filed by All Defendants. (Martin, Sean)\").\n\nSo Type_of_Counsel entries: \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel\" and \"Defendants: Private counsel\". But the checklist example says \"private counsel, legal services/public defender, etc.\" So \"Private counsel\" is the category.\n\nNow, from the Docket, I can extract all these. Filing_Date is 2025-05-15. Who_are_the_Parties: Plaintiffs are Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities; Defendants are Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service. Class_Action: Individual, since it's not a class action. Type_of_Counsel: Plaintiffs and Defendants both have private counsel.\n\nWait, but the Amended Complaint in Entry 6 lists specific defendants, so the initial filing's \"All Defendants\" was vague, but the Amended Complaint specifies. So the parties are as per the Amended Complaint. But the initial filing date is from the Complaint (Entry 1), so Filing_Date is 2025-05-15.\n\nNow, the Docket has been read, so I need to use append_checklist or update_checklist to add these values. Since all keys are empty, I should use append_checklist to add each value.\n\nWait, the checklist requires evidence. For Filing_Date, the evidence is the date in Entry 1: \"Filed by Federation of State Humanities Councils... (Entered: 05/15/2025)\". So the value is \"2025-05-15\", evidence text is \"2025-05-15 | Complaint. Filing fee... (Entered: 05/15/2025)\".\n\nFor Who_are_the_Parties, the plaintiffs are listed in Entry 1: \"Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities against All Defendants\". Then in Entry 6, the defendants are specified as \"Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service\". So the parties are Plaintiffs: Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities; Defendants: Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service. Need to format as 'Plaintiff: [description]' etc. So two entries: Plaintiff: Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities; Defendant: Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service.\n\nBut the checklist says \"descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles...\". So maybe each party as a separate entry? Wait, the plaintiffs are two organizations, so maybe two entries? But the example says \"Plaintiff: [description]\", so perhaps list all plaintiff descriptions under one entry. Similarly for defendants.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"each party\" so for each plaintiff and defendant, but the description might be a single string. The example shows \"Plaintiff: [description]\", so probably one entry per party type. So Plaintiffs: Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities (as a single description), and Defendants: Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: Since it's not a class action (no mention of class in the Docket), it's Individual Plaintiffs. So \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: Plaintiffs' counsel is Sortun, Anna (private counsel), Defendants' counsel is Martin, Sean (private counsel). So \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel\" and \"Defendants: Private counsel\".\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"the category of legal representation for each party\". So each party (plaintiffs and defendants) have their counsel type. So two entries for Type_of_Counsel.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Type_of_Counsel\" as a single key, but it can have multiple values. So the extracted list for Type_of_Counsel should include both \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel\" and \"Defendants: Private counsel\".\n\nNow, since the Docket has been read, and these values are present, I need to append them to the checklist. So the next action should be append_checklist with the extracted values and evidence.\n\nCheck the Docket again to confirm:\n\nFiling_Date: Entry 1 has \"Entered: 05/15/2025\", so Filing_Date is 2025-05-15.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: Plaintiffs in Entry 1: \"Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\". Defendants in Entry 6: \"against Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service\".\n\nClass_Action: No mention of class action in the Docket. The Complaint is just a standard complaint, so it's individual plaintiffs.\n\nType_of_Counsel: Plaintiffs' counsel is Sortun, Anna (Entry 1), so private counsel. Defendants' counsel is Martin, Sean (Entry 29), so private counsel.\n\nSo the evidence for each:\n\n- Filing_Date: \"2025-05-15 | Complaint. Filing fee... (Entered: 05/15/2025)\" from Docket entry 1.\n\n- Who_are_the_Parties: For plaintiffs, \"Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\" from Entry 1. For defendants, \"Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service\" from Entry 6.\n\n- Class_Action: Since no class action mentioned, \"Individual\" with description as the plaintiff entities. Evidence: The Complaint filed on 05/15/2025 without class action designation.\n\n- Type_of_Counsel: Plaintiffs' counsel: \"Sortun, Anna\" from Entry 1; Defendants' counsel: \"Martin, Sean\" from Entry 29. Both are private counsel.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have four keys with their entries. Each entry needs evidence with text, source_document (Docket), location (e.g., Docket entry 1 for Filing_Date).\n\nWait, the Docket is the document, so source_document is \"Docket\" for all these.\n\nFor Filing_Date, value is \"2025-05-15\", evidence text is \"2025-05-15 | Complaint. Filing fee in the amount of $405 collected. Agency Tracking ID: AORDC-9849714 Filer is subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1. Jury Trial Requested: No. Filed by Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities against All Defendants (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Proposed Summons). (Sortun, Anna) (Entered: 05/15/2025)\".\n\nLocation: Docket entry 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the next action is to append these values using append_checklist. Since all are new, append_checklist is the right function.\n\nNeed to structure the patch with each key and their extracted entries.\n\nFiling_Date: one entry, value \"2025-05-15\".\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: two entries: one for Plaintiffs, one for Defendants.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: two entries: \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel\", \"Defendants: Private counsel\".\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Who_are_the_Parties\" should have the party descriptions. So the value for that key should be a list of entries like \"Plaintiff: [description]\" and \"Defendant: [description]\".\n\nSimilarly, Type_of_Counsel should have \"Plaintiffs: Private counsel\" and \"Defendants: Private counsel\".\n\nSo the extracted list for Who_are_the_Parties will have two entries, each with their evidence.\n\nNow, the evidence for each must be verbatim text from the document.\n\nFor Who_are_the_Parties, Plaintiffs: the text from Entry 1: \"Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\". So evidence text: \"Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\".\n\nDefendants: from Entry 6: \"against Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service\". So evidence text: \"Amy Gleason, Michael McDonald, National Endowment for the Humanities, United States DOGE Service\".\n\nClass_Action: The value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\". Evidence: The absence of class action mention. But the requirement says evidence must be verbatim. So perhaps the text from Entry 1 that says \"Complaint\" without class action. But the exact text might not have \"Individual\", but the fact that it's not a class action. However, the instructions say \"every extracted entry must include evidence with verbatim snippet\". So need to find a snippet that supports it.\n\nLooking at Entry 1: \"Complaint. Filing fee... Filer is subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1.\" Fed R. Civ. P. 7.1 is about corporate parties, not class actions. The absence of \"class\" in the document suggests it's not a class action. So evidence text could be \"Complaint\" and \"Filer is subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1.\" But the key is to have a verbatim snippet that supports \"Individual Plaintiffs\".\n\nAlternatively, the Amended Complaint in Entry 6 doesn't mention class action, so the initial complaint was not a class action. But the Docket's Entry 1 is the first filing. So evidence is the text from Entry 1.\n\nThe requirement says \"each extracted value should be self-contained and easy to read\", so the evidence should include the text that supports it.\n\nFor Class_Action, the evidence text would be \"Complaint. Filing fee... Filer is subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1. Jury Trial Requested: No.\" (since no class action mentioned).\n\nBut the exact wording for the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description is the plaintiff entities.\n\nSo the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: For Plaintiffs, the counsel is Sortun, Anna, so \"Private counsel\". Evidence text: \"Filed by Federation of State Humanities Councils, Oregon Council for the Humanities... (Sortun, Anna)\".\n\nSimilarly, Defendants' counsel: \"Filed by All Defendants. (Martin, Sean)\".\n\nSo for Type_of_Counsel, two entries:\n\n- Plaintiffs: Private counsel, evidence from Entry 1.\n\n- Defendants: Private counsel, evidence from Entry 29.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to the checklist using append_checklist. Since all keys are empty, this is the correct step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"2025-05-15\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"2025-05-15 | Complaint.

The user has provided a legal checklist extraction task, and I need to figure out the next action based on the current state.\n\nFirst, checking the available documents. The Docket is fully visited (✓), so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the checklist items have already been filled with values from the Docket. The current status shows all 4 keys have values, with Filing_Date having 1 value, Who_are_the_Parties 2, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs 1, and Type_of_Counsel 2. The total values extracted are 6.\n\nWait, the checklist items were already extracted in Step 3 via append_checklist. The problem says to extract all checklist items, and the current state shows all keys are filled. The next step should be to verify if there's any missing information that needs to be checked in other documents. But the checklist definitions don't mention needing more info from other documents. For example, Filing_Date is already set to 2025-05-15 from the Docket entry 1. The other keys like Who_are_the_Parties and Type_of_Counsel were also extracted from the Docket.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Amended Complaint, Complaint, Opinion, and other briefs might have more details, but the checklist items don't require additional data. For instance, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs was set to \"Individual\" based on the Docket entry 1 mentioning \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" But maybe the Amended Complaint has more info. Wait, the Amended Complaint (entry 6) says \"Amended Complaint for Injunction and Declaratory Relief\" filed by the same plaintiffs, but the type of action (class vs individual) might still be individual. The Docket entry 1 says \"Jury Trial Requested: No,\" which might indicate individual, but maybe the Amended Complaint clarifies. However, the current extraction already has \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\" so maybe that's sufficient.\n\nBut the instructions say to extract all distinct values. Since the Docket entry 1 mentions \"Jury Trial Requested: No,\" which is part of the complaint filing, the extraction for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs is based on that. The checklist item says to format as \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The current entry uses the plaintiff names as the description, which matches the example.\n\nNow, checking if any other documents might add more values. For example, Type_of_Counsel has two entries: Plaintiffs and Defendants as private counsel. The Docket entry 1 mentions \"Filed by... (Sortun, Anna)\" for plaintiffs, and entry 29 has \"Filed by All Defendants. (Martin, Sean)\" for defendants. So the counsel types are covered. The other documents like the Memorandum or Amicus Brief might mention counsel, but the Type_of_Counsel item is already covered. The checklist doesn't require more than that.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract all applicable checklist items. Since all keys are filled and there's no indication that more values are needed (e.g., multiple filing dates or additional party descriptions), the next step should be to confirm that all items are complete. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 4/4\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/4\". So maybe it's time to stop.\n\nWait, the Stop Criteria says to stop when every key is complete or Not Applicable. All keys here are complete. The checklist summary shows all keys are filled, so the next action should be to stop. The previous step (Step 3) already appended all values, and the current status shows all keys have values. There's no need to read other documents because the checklist items don't require more info from them. For example, the Filing_Date is clearly 2025-05-15 from the first docket entry. The parties are listed in the first and amended complaint entries. The class action status is inferred from the complaint details.

The available documents show the other five are unvisited, but since all required values are already extracted from the Docket, there's no need to read them. \n\nThe key point here is that the checklist items don't require additional documents. For example:\n- Filing_Date is clearly established as 2025-05-15 from the initial Complaint filing.\n- Who_are_the_Parties is fully covered by the plaintiff and defendant lists in the Complaint and Amended Complaint.\n- Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs is confirmed as \"Individual\" from the Complaint's description.\n- Type_of_Counsel is identified by the filers (Sortun, Anna for plaintiffs; Martin, Sean for defendants) as private counsel.\n\nNo Not Applicable items are needed since all checklist items have valid evidence. The system's step 4 already called `stop`, but the current state shows a \"stop attempt 1/2\". The instructions say to stop when all keys are complete, which they are. The automatic `get_checklist` after step 4 confirmed 4/4 filled.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to issue a final `stop` with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted with evidence from the fully visited Docket document.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 4 checklist items are fully extracted with complete evidence from the fully visited Docket document.
