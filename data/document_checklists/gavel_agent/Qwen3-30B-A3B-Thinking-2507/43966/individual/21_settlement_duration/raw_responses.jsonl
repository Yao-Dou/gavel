The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the first function to call here is list_documents. There's no need to read or search any documents yet because there are none to read. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system needs to discover them first.

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from the documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The checklist specifies that settlement obligations not in court orders should be included. So, court orders like Judgment, Opinion, and Orders might not have the settlement terms if they're incorporated into the order. The Complaints (Class Action and Third Amended) might have settlement terms if they're part of the agreement.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaints are unvisited and have token counts around 7k-8k. The Docket is 14k tokens, which might list settlement terms. The Orders and Opinions are more likely to have court orders, so maybe the settlement is in the Complaints or Docket.\n\nThe user mentioned that settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order should be included. So, if the Complaints mention a settlement duration, that's the place to look. The Docket might have a settlement entry. The Orders like \"Order Granting Fees\" probably aren't relevant.\n\nSince the current status shows all keys empty, and the first action was list_documents, now I should choose a document to read. The Complaints are the best candidates. Let's pick the Third Amended Class Action Complaint first because it's a later version, which might include updated settlement terms. The document is unvisited, so I'll read it. But I need to read a token range. Since it's 8,364 tokens, maybe start from the beginning to check for settlement terms. The max token range is 10k, so reading the whole document is possible. Wait, but the user said \"targeted window\" ≤10k, so reading the whole document is okay. However, the system says not to reread, but this is unvisited. So, read_document on the Third Amended Complaint from token 0 to 8364.\n\nWait, but the token count is 8,364, so start_token 0, end_token 8364. That's within the 10k limit. So, call read_document with doc_name \"Third Amended Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", start 0, end 8364.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Third Amended Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8364}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Third Amended Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8364}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3495, "completion_tokens": 563, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which refers to the duration of settlement obligations in negotiated agreements, not incorporated into court orders.\n\nLooking at the current status: the only document read so far is the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, which is fully visited (tokens 0-8364). The document is a complaint, not a settlement agreement. The complaint details the plaintiffs' claims against the City of Grants Pass regarding anti-camping ordinances and homelessness. There's no mention of a settlement or any duration related to a settlement. The document is about the lawsuit, not a resolution.\n\nThe user's task is to extract settlement duration, but the complaint doesn't contain that information. The other documents listed (Docket, Judgment, Opinion, etc.) might have settlement terms. The Docket might list settlement entries, but the current action history shows only the complaint was read. The available documents include Docket, Judgment, and several Orders/Opinions, which are unvisited.\n\nSince the complaint is fully visited and doesn't have the required info, the next step is to check other documents. The Docket (14,594 tokens) is a likely candidate because dockets often list settlement agreements, court dates, and related orders. The Docket might mention a settlement with a duration. So, the next action should be to read the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited, so using read_document on it, starting from token 0-10000 (since it's under 10k tokens, but the document is 14k, so maybe read 0-10000 first). Wait, the maximum is 10k tokens per read, so reading 0-10000 for the Docket.\n\nWait, the Docket is 14,594 tokens, so reading 0-10000 would cover the first part. But maybe the settlement info is in the later part. But since we don't know, start with the first 10k tokens. Alternatively, use search_document_regex to look for \"settlement\" or \"duration\" in the Docket. But the user's instructions say to use read_document as the default when targeting a specific document. The Docket is the most likely place for settlement details, so read_document on Docket from 0-10000.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", so the key is to find the duration. The complaint doesn't have it, so need to check other docs. The Docket is the next logical step. So the action should be read_document for the Docket document, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12421, "completion_tokens": 628, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations in negotiated agreements, not incorporated into court orders.\n\nLooking at the provided documents. The user has already read the Third Amended Class Action Complaint and the Docket. The Complaint is fully visited (tokens 0-8364), and the Docket is partially visited (0-10000 out of 14,594). \n\nIn the Complaint, the plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief, not a settlement. The prayer for relief includes an injunction to stop enforcement of certain ordinances unless the city provides a place for people to rest. There's no mention of a settlement duration here. The Complaint is about the lawsuit, not a settlement agreement.\n\nThe Docket shows the case progression: complaints, motions, hearings, and eventually an order granting summary judgment in part. The last entry (111) is an Opinion and Order granting part of the plaintiffs' motion. The Docket doesn't mention any settlement terms either. The case is ongoing, with the court granting some relief but not a settlement.\n\nWait, the user needs to find a settlement duration. But in the documents read so far, there's no settlement mentioned. The case is still in litigation. The key point here is that the checklist specifies \"negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments.\" Since the documents show the case is being decided by the court (not a settlement), the settlement duration might not be present. But I need to check other documents.\n\nThe available documents include \"Judgment,\" \"Opinion,\" \"Order Granting Fees,\" etc. The user hasn't read those yet. But the Docket entry 111 is an Opinion and Order, which is part of the court's decision. The Complaint and Docket don't have a settlement. The next step is to check if other documents (like the Judgment or Opinion) might mention a settlement. However, the Opinion (111) says \"Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment 62 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment 80 is DENIED.\" So it's a court order, not a settlement. \n\nWait, the user's checklist says to exclude court orders. So if there's no settlement mentioned in any document, then the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" should be marked as Not Applicable. But the instructions say to mark it as Not Applicable only if there's explicit evidence, like \"no settlement reached\" or the case is decided by court.\n\nLooking at the Docket, entry 112 is \"Stipulated Notice of Dismissal of Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection Claims Filed by All Plaintiffs.\" This is a dismissal of some claims, but it's part of the litigation, not a settlement. The case is still ongoing. The user hasn't found any settlement agreement, so the key should be Not Applicable.\n\nBut wait, the checklist requires extracting settlement duration from negotiated agreements. If no such agreement exists in the documents, then it's Not Applicable. The evidence for Not Applicable would be the absence of settlement terms in the case documents, with the case being resolved via court order (as per the Opinion and Order). \n\nSo the next step is to use update_checklist to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the documents. The evidence should reference that the case was resolved through court orders (e.g., the Opinion and Order granting summary judgment in part), not through a settlement agreement. \n\nCheck the documents again: The Complaint (read) doesn't mention settlement. The Docket (partially read) shows the case moving through motions and court orders, with no settlement. The Opinion (111) is a court order, not a settlement. So the key should be Not Applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist with the key set to \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the court's order that the case was decided by the court, not a settlement.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"OPINION AND ORDER: For the reasons set forth in this Opinion and Order, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment 62 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

It's marked as Not Applicable, with evidence from the Docket documents (entries 111 and 112). The evidence mentions the court granting part of the motion for summary judgment and a stipulated dismissal of claims, but no settlement agreement with a duration.\n\nWait, the user's step 4 used update_checklist to set it to Not Applicable. The evidence says \"Not Applicable\" because there's no settlement agreement mentioned. The court didn't approve a settlement; instead, they granted summary judgment in part and dismissed some claims. So the settlement duration isn't applicable here.\n\nNow, checking the available documents. The Docket was partially read (69% coverage, tokens 0-10000). The current read goes up to token 10000, but the Docket has 14,594 tokens. There might be more info in the remaining tokens (10001-14594). However, the previous steps read the Docket up to token 10000, which included the key entries like the opinion and order (entry 111) and the dismissal notice (entry 112). The next part of the Docket might not contain settlement info since the case was resolved via summary judgment, not settlement.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited. But the checklist item is about settlement duration. If the case was resolved via court order (summary judgment) rather than a settlement agreement, then \"Not Applicable\" is correct. The evidence from the Docket entries 111 and 112 supports that: the court granted summary judgment, not a settlement. So the settlement duration isn't applicable.\n\nThe user's current status shows all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. The only key is marked Not Applicable. So, the next step should be to stop because all checklist items are accounted for. The \"Not Applicable\" is properly set with evidence from the Docket. There's no need to check other documents because the settlement duration doesn't exist in the case as it's a court decision, not a settlement.\n\nWait, but the user should confirm if any other documents might have settlement info. The other documents listed are Complaints, Judgments, Opinions, etc. The Third Amended Complaint was fully visited, and it's a complaint, not a settlement.
