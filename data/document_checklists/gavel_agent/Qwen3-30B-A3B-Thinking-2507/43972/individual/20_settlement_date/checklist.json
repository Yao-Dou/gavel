The order concludes the suspension violated the Florida Constitution and was based in part on a violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. But the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law. And the suspension would have occurred even had there been no First Amendment violation\u2014the First Amendment violation was not essential to the outcome. This order thus directs entry of judgment for the Governor."
