The system's decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. Since there are no documents listed, I can't read anything or search yet. The only logical action here is to list the documents to see what's in the corpus.\n\nThe user provided a snapshot where the documents are unknown, so the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the catalog. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing the documents first.

The complaint is usually where the causes of action are listed, so that's a prime candidate. The complaint document is 1,431 tokens and unvisited. Since it's a small document, reading the entire thing makes sense here.\n\nThe other documents like motions or orders might reference causes of action, but the complaint is the most direct source. For example, in a complaint, the plaintiff lists the legal bases for their claims. So starting with the Complaint seems efficient.\n\nI should use read_document to get the full text of the Complaint. The token count is under 10,000, so it's within the limit. No need for regex search here because the complaint is a specific document where the cause of action is expected to be stated upfront.\n\nI'll call read_document for the Complaint with start_token 0 and end_token 1431.

The text shows the complaint's verification, but no mention of the legal basis. The user's next step is to figure out where else to look.\n\nThe available documents include the Complaint (fully visited), Docket, Orders, Motions, etc. The Docket might have the cause of action listed. The Docket is 31,111 tokens, unvisited. Since the Complaint didn't have it, the next logical step is to check the Docket document, which often lists the case's cause of action in the initial filing.\n\nI should use read_document on the Docket. But first, confirm if the Docket is the right place. The Docket typically has the case details, including the causes of action. Since the Complaint's first few pages don't mention it, the Docket might have it. The user should read the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited, so reading it is the next step. No regex needed here because the cause of action is likely in a standard section of the Docket.

The checklist item specifies that it's the legal vehicle used to bring the claims, like statutes or judge-made causes (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Bivens). They want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to check which documents have been read so far. The recent actions show that \"Complaint\" (tokens 0-1431) and \"Docket\" (tokens 0-10000) have been read. The Complaint is fully visited, and the Docket is partially visited.\n\nLooking at the Complaint text provided, the first few pages are just headers and the verification statement. The key part might be in the body of the Complaint, but the user only provided up to page 28, which ends with the verification. Wait, the text given for the Complaint doesn't actually contain the body of the complaint. The headers and the verification statement don't mention the cause of action. So maybe the cause of action isn't in the Complaint document.\n\nThe Docket document lists entries like \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\" and mentions exhibits, but the Docket itself is a log of filings, not the actual complaint. The cause of action would likely be in the Complaint or maybe in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nWait, the Complaint is the first document, but the user only provided the headers and the verification. The actual cause of action is probably in the body of the Complaint, which isn't shown here. But according to the provided text, the Complaint's content from tokens 0-1431 doesn't include the cause of action. So maybe the cause of action is in another document.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The available documents include \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" (83 tokens) and \"Brief of Amicus Curiae...\" which might have the cause of action mentioned. But the user hasn't read those yet.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions only read Complaint and Docket. The Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS ( Filing fee $ 402 receipt number AFLNDC-7401384.), filed by ANDREW H WARREN.\" But the cause of action isn't listed here. The Docket is just a log, so the actual cause would be in the Complaint itself.\n\nBut the Complaint's content provided doesn't have the cause. So maybe the cause is in another document. Let's check the \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" which is listed as 83 tokens. That's a short document, so maybe it's worth reading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint's body is in the provided text but not shown. Wait, the user provided the Complaint's tokens 0-1431, but the text given is just the headers and the verification. The actual complaint might start after page 28, but the user says it's up to page 28. Wait, the text shows \"Page 28 of 28\" followed by the verification. So the complaint's body might not be in the 1431 tokens provided. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's Step 2 says they read Complaint (tokens 0-1431), but the text they provided is the headers and the verification. So perhaps the actual complaint content (where the cause of action is stated) is beyond the 1431 tokens. But the document's token count is 1,431, so it's fully covered. That's confusing. Maybe the cause of action is not in the Complaint, or maybe the provided text is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cause of action is in the Docket entries. For example, entry 3 mentions \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction by ANDREW H WARREN\" with exhibits. But the Docket doesn't list the cause of action.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says not to include remedies or procedural doctrines, so the cause of action should be a specific statute or legal theory. For example, if the complaint cites 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that's the cause.\n\nSince the Complaint's body isn't visible in the provided text, maybe the next step is to read another document. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" is a short document (83 tokens), so reading that might be efficient. The user might have missed the cause in the Complaint, so checking the motion could help.\n\nAlternatively, check if the Docket has any entries that mention the cause. But Docket entries are just logs. The \"Complaint\" entry (entry 1) says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", but doesn't specify the cause.\n\nAnother possibility: the cause of action might be in the \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" or other exhibits, but those are unvisited. However, the user should prioritize documents that are likely to contain the cause of action. The Complaint is the primary document where the cause would be stated, but since it's fully read and no cause was found, maybe it's not there. Wait, but the user's provided text for the Complaint doesn't include the body. Maybe the body is in the tokens beyond 1431, but the document is only 1431 tokens. So the entire complaint is in those tokens, and the body isn't shown. Wait, the user says \"Read from Complaint (tokens 0-1431):\" followed by the headers and verification. So the actual complaint content (the allegations and causes) might be in the same tokens but not shown in the example. Wait, but the user's example shows that the complaint ends with the verification statement on page 28. So the body of the complaint is probably in the earlier pages, but the user's provided text starts from page 1, which is headers, then page 28. Maybe the actual content is missing in the example.\n\nWait, the user provided the Complaint as 28 pages, but the text shows page 1 to 28 with headers, then the verification. So the actual complaint might be in the body, but the user's example didn't include it. This is a problem. But according to the task, I have to work with the provided text.\n\nGiven that, maybe the cause of action isn't in the Complaint or Docket as provided. So the next step is to check other documents. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" is 83 tokens, which is very short. It's possible that the cause of action is mentioned there. For example, the motion might reference the cause of action.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might mention it, but that's longer. But the user should start with the most likely documents.\n\nSince the Complaint was fully read and no cause found, the next likely document is the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. So the action should be to read that document.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 83 tokens - ○ Unvisited. So it's unvisited and small. Reading it would be efficient.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" with tokens 0-83 (since it's 83 tokens total).\n\nWait, the document's token count is 83, so reading tokens 0-83 would cover it all. The user should read the entire document since it's small.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to use read_document on \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" with start_token 0 and end_token 83.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 83}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 83}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15959, "completion_tokens": 1698, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from the legal documents provided. The checklist specifies that this is the legal vehicle used to bring the claims, like specific statutes or judge-made causes, not underlying rights or remedies.\n\nFirst, I'll check the documents that have been read so far. The Complaint (tokens 0-1431) was fully read, and the Docket was partially read (0-10000 tokens). The Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction was also fully read but only tokens 0-83, which seems very short.\n\nLooking at the Complaint's content, the verification statement mentions \"I, Andrew H. Warren, state as follows\" but doesn't list any legal causes. The Docket entries are mostly about filings and motions, not the actual causes of action. The motion's content is minimal (just page headers), so no useful info there.\n\nHmm, the next step is to find where the cause of action is likely stated. In legal complaints, the cause of action is typically in the body of the complaint, not the verification. But the Complaint read only went up to page 28, which might not include the actual claims. Wait, the user said they read tokens 0-1431, but maybe the actual cause of action is in the later pages. However, the provided text for the Complaint ends with the verification statement on page 28. The first 27 pages are just headers, so maybe the cause of action is in the body, but the user's read stopped at page 28. Wait, the Complaint is 28 pages, but the text provided shows pages 1-27 as headers, then page 28 has the verification. So maybe the actual complaint content (including the cause of action) wasn't included in the 1431 tokens read. Wait, the user's step 2 says they read Complaint tokens 0-1431, but the sample text shows the headers. Maybe the actual complaint text is in the remaining tokens beyond 1431? But the document is only 1431 tokens, so maybe the cause of action wasn't in the read portion.\n\nWait, the Complaint's token count is 1431, and they read all 1431 tokens. But the sample text shows headers for pages 1-28, but the actual complaint body (which would list the causes) might be missing. The verification statement at the end doesn't mention causes. So maybe the Complaint's body wasn't included in the read, or perhaps the cause is in another document.\n\nLooking at the Docket, which has 31,111 tokens but only 0-10000 read. The Docket entries include \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\" but don't specify the cause. However, the Docket entry 3 mentions \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" and the Complaint was filed. The actual causes would be in the Complaint itself. Since the Complaint's body wasn't extracted, maybe the next step is to read more of the Complaint. But the Complaint is already marked as Fully Visited (✓), so we can't read it again.\n\nWait, the available documents list the Complaint as Fully Visited (100% coverage), so we can't read it again. So maybe the cause of action is in another document. Let's check the other documents. The Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction was read, but only 83 tokens, which is very short. The motion might reference the cause of action, but the sample shows it's just headers.\n\nThe next logical step is to check if the cause of action is mentioned in the Docket entries. The Docket has entries like \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", but the cause of action is a specific legal basis. Maybe in the Complaint's filing details. Wait, the Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS (Filing fee $402 receipt...)\" but doesn't state the cause. However, sometimes the cause is in the complaint's caption or first paragraph.\n\nWait, the user's step 2 read the Complaint, which includes the verification statement, but the complaint's body (which should list the causes) might be in the earlier pages. The provided text shows pages 1-27 as headers (with case numbers), and page 28 as the verification. So maybe the actual complaint text (with causes) is missing from the read. But since the document is marked as fully visited, we can't read it again. So perhaps the cause of action isn't in the Complaint, or maybe it's in another document.\n\nAnother possibility: the cause of action might be in the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The motion's title mentions \"Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", but the actual cause would be in the body. However, the read only got the first two pages (which are headers), so no content. The document is marked as Fully Visited, so we can't read more.\n\nWait, the available documents list \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" as fully visited (✓), so we can't read it again. So where else could the cause of action be? Maybe in the Amicus Briefs or other motions. But those are unvisited.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting every distinct value of the cause of action. If the Complaint doesn't list it, maybe it's in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, but since we can't read more of it, we need to check other documents. However, the Docket has a lot of entries. Maybe the cause is mentioned in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction's description. Wait, the Docket entry 3 says \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction by ANDREW H WARREN\" but doesn't specify the cause. The Motion itself might have the cause, but we can't access it.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions have read the Complaint, Docket (partially), and the Motion. Since the Complaint is fully read and doesn't contain the cause (as per the provided text), and the Motion's body wasn't read (only headers), perhaps the cause is in the Complaint's body which wasn't included in the read. But since the document is fully visited, we can't read it again. So maybe the cause of action isn't present in the corpus, but the task says to extract from the provided documents.\n\nWait, the verification statement in the Complaint mentions \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently issued an Executive Order suspending me from that office.\" But that's a fact, not the cause of action. The cause would be something like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or similar. The user's step 2's read of the Complaint doesn't show any such reference.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries again, entry 3 is the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which might reference the cause. But since we can't read the Motion's body, maybe we need to search for patterns like \"cause of action\" or specific statutes. But the user's instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The cause of action is likely a specific statute or case, so a regex search might help.\n\nSo the next action should be to use search_document_regex to look for common legal causes, like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Title II of the ADA\", \"Bivens\", etc. But since the corpus has many documents, we should search all documents. The pattern could be something like r'(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § \\d+|Title II of the ADA|Bivens)'.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions have read the Docket partially (0-10000 tokens). The Docket has a lot of entries, but maybe the cause is mentioned in the Complaint's filing details. Wait, the Complaint's filing in the Docket says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", but the cause is part of the complaint. Since the complaint was fully read and doesn't have it, maybe it's not present. But the task says to extract from the documents, so if it's not there, we might have to mark it as Not Applicable. But the instructions say not to mark it as Not Applicable without evidence. So we need to check all documents.\n\nThe Docket is partially visited (32% coverage), so maybe the cause is in the unvisited part of the Docket. But the Docket is a list of filings, not the content of the filings. The actual causes would be in the Complaint or other pleadings. Since the Complaint is fully visited and doesn't contain the cause, and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction is fully visited but only headers, the next step is to search other documents for the cause.\n\nWait, the user's available documents list \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" as unvisited. The Executive Order might reference legal authority, but the cause of action is how the plaintiff is suing, not the executive order itself. The Executive Order might be the basis for the claim, but the cause of action would be the statute enabling the suit.\n\nAnother possibility: the Complaint's body (which was supposed to be in the 1431 tokens) might have the cause, but the user's provided text for the Complaint only shows headers and the verification. Maybe the actual complaint text is missing from the read. But since the document is marked as fully visited, we have to assume it's all read. So perhaps the cause of action isn't present in the corpus, but we need to confirm.\n\nWait, the user's step 2's read of the Complaint shows the verification statement, but the complaint's body (which would list the causes) is probably in the earlier pages. However, the sample text provided shows pages 1-27 as headers, and page 28 as verification. So maybe the complaint's actual content (with causes) wasn't included in the token read. But the document is marked as fully visited, so we can't read it again.\n\nGiven that, the next step is to search for the cause of action in other documents. The best approach is to use search_document_regex on all documents to look for common cause of action patterns. So the next action should be to call search_document_regex with a pattern that matches likely causes, like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Bivens\", \"Title II of the ADA\", etc.\n\nThe pattern could be: r'(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § \\d+|Bivens|Title II of the ADA|FTCA)'\n\nSince the user's instructions say to use precise patterns, this regex should match common causes. Using 'all' for doc_name to search all documents.\n\nSo the next action is search_document_regex with that pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"all\", \"pattern\": \"(42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § \\\\d+|Bivens|Title II of the ADA|FTCA)\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § \\d+|Bivens|Title II of the ADA|FTCA)", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16115, "completion_tokens": 2365, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from the legal documents. The checklist definition says it's the legal vehicle used to bring claims, like statutes or judge-made causes (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Bivens), not underlying rights or remedies.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've read the Complaint, Docket, Plaintiff's Motion, and did a regex search. The regex search found matches in several documents. Let me check the regex results.\n\nThe regex pattern was \"(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § \\d+|Bivens|Title II of the ADA|FTCA)\". The search found 8 matches across documents. Let's go through each match to see if they're valid causes of action.\n\nFirst, in the Emergency Motion document (match 1): \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\". So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is a cause of action here. That's a valid entry.\n\nNext, the Opinion of the Court (001) has multiple matches. Match 1: \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Match 2: same. Match 3: \"First Amendment\" but no specific statute, so maybe not. The key is the statute, not the amendment. So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again.\n\nOrder on the Merits (match 1): \"claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First Amendment\". So again, \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\".\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief (match 1): \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" listed in statutes. Match 2: \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\".\n\nSo all the matches point to \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" as the cause of action. The other terms like \"Bivens\", \"Title II\", \"FTCA\" didn't appear in the matches, so they're not present here.\n\nNeed to check if there are other documents that might have different causes. The regex search was done on all documents, and the matches are the only ones found. The user has already read some documents, but the regex search covered the relevant parts.\n\nThe key point is to make sure that \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is the only cause of action here. The Complaint mentions \"First and Fourteenth Amendments\" but the cause is the statute. The regex search correctly picked up the statute.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with evidence from multiple documents. But the checklist says to deduplicate, so even though it's in multiple documents, it's one entry.\n\nNow, need to create evidence entries. Each evidence should have text, source_document, location. For example, from Emergency Motion: the quote \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Source is \"Emergency Motion to Quash Subpoena and/or for Protective Order and Memorandum of Law\", location tokens 2429-2629.\n\nSimilarly, from Opinion of the Court (001) match 1: \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" from tokens 294-494.\n\nBut the checklist requires each unique value with its own evidence. Since it's the same value, we can have multiple evidence entries for the same value. The extracted list will have one value with multiple evidence entries.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each unique value\" so \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is one value, but it can have multiple evidence sources. So in the extracted list, the value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" will have multiple evidence entries from different documents.\n\nSo the action now is to use append_checklist to add this value with all the evidence found. Since it's the first time, we need to append it.\n\nWait, the current status shows Cause_of_Action is empty. So we need to add the extracted value. The regex search found the matches, so the next step is to append the checklist item with the extracted value and evidence.\n\nCheck the tools: append_checklist is for adding new entries. Since this is the first extraction for Cause_of_Action, we should use append_checklist.\n\nEach evidence entry must have text, source_document, location. For each match, we have a text snippet, source document, and token range.\n\nSo for the Emergency Motion match: text is \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", source is \"Emergency Motion to Quash Subpoena and/or for Protective Order and Memorandum of Law\", location is tokens 2429-2629.\n\nSimilarly, Opinion of the Court (001) match 1: text \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", source \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", location 294-494.\n\nBut need to make sure the text is verbatim. The regex search results have the snippets.\n\nAlso, check if there are other causes. The regex pattern included Bivens, but none of the matches had that. So only 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with multiple evidence entries.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call append_checklist with the patch containing Cause_of_Action and the extracted entries.\n\nThe parameters for append_checklist: patch array with key \"Cause_of_Action\" and extracted array of entries, each with evidence (array of evidence entries) and value.\n\nEach evidence entry in the evidence array has text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for each match, create an evidence entry.\n\nWait, the regex search returned 8 matches, but most are variations of the same statute. Need to check if all are the same value.\n\nLooking at the matches:\n\n- Emergency Motion: 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- Opinion of the Court (001) matches 1,2,3: all 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- Order on the Merits: 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- Plaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief: 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nSo all are the same value. So we'll have multiple evidence entries for the same value.\n\nSo the patch should have Cause_of_Action with extracted array containing one value (\"42 U.S.C. § 1983\") and multiple evidence entries (each from different documents).\n\nWait, no: the extracted array in the patch for append_checklist is the list of values to append. Each value in extracted is an entry. But since it's the same value, we can have multiple evidence entries for the same value. Wait, no—the value is the same, so the extracted array should have one entry with multiple evidence entries.\n\nWait, the structure for each entry in extracted is:\n\n{\n  \"evidence\": [\n    { \"text\": \"...\", \"source_document\": \"...\", \"location\": \"...\" },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\"\n}\n\nSo for the same value, we can have multiple evidence entries under the same value.\n\nSo in the patch, for Cause_of_Action, extracted should have one item with the value and all the evidence entries.\n\nBut the user has to append all the evidence. So the extracted array for Cause_of_Action will have one element (the value), and that element's evidence array will have all the evidence snippets.\n\nWait, no: the extracted array in the patch for append_checklist is an array of entries to append. Each entry is a value with its own evidence. So if we have multiple evidence sources for the same value, we should create one entry with all the evidence.\n\nYes, because it's the same value. So the extracted array will have one entry with the value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and an evidence array containing all the snippets.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch should look like:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            { \"text\": \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Emergency Motion to Quash Subpoena and/or for Protective Order and Memorandum of Law\", \"location\": \"tokens 2429-2629\" },\n            { \"text\": \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"location\": \"tokens 294-494\" },\n            { \"text\": \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"location\": \"tokens 7459-7659\" },\n            { \"text\": \"claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First Amendment\", \"source_document\": \"Order on the Merits\", \"location\": \"tokens 1252-1452\" },\n            { \"text\": \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Plaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief\", \"location\": \"tokens 14537-14737\" }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the regex search had 8 matches. Let me count the matches again.\n\nFrom the search results:\n\n- Emergency Motion: 1 match\n- Opinion of the Court (001): 3 matches\n- Order on the Merits: 2 matches\n- Plaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief: 2 matches\n\nTotal 8. But some might be the same. For example, Opinion of the Court (001) match 1 and 2 both say \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\". So even though there are 8 matches, the value is the same, so we can group them.\n\nBut the evidence should include all the locations. So each match's text is a separate evidence entry.\n\nSo the evidence array will have 8 entries, but the value is the same. Wait, no. Each match's text is a separate evidence snippet, but they all refer to the same cause of action. So the value is the same, so we include all the text snippets as evidence for the same value.\n\nYes. So the extracted array for Cause_of_Action will have one entry with value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and an evidence array with all 8 snippets.\n\nWait, but the user should only include unique evidence. However, the requirement is to include all evidence supporting the value. So each match's text is a separate evidence entry, even if they're the same value.\n\nSo the evidence array will have 8 entries, each with their own text, source, location.\n\nBut looking at the actual snippets:\n\nEmergency Motion: \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\"\n\nOpinion (001) match 1: \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\"\n\nOpinion (001) match 2: \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" (same as match 1)\n\nWait, the second match in Opinion (001) is \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" as well. So two instances in the same document.\n\nBut the evidence needs to be verbatim. So each occurrence should be a separate evidence entry.\n\nHowever, the user might have to list them all. But the problem says \"every distinct value\" but the value is the same, so it's one value with multiple evidence.\n\nSo the action is to append the Cause_of_Action with all the evidence entries.\n\nNow, check if any other causes were found. The regex pattern included Bivens, Title II, FTCA, but none of the matches had those. So only 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nSo the next step is to append the checklist with this value.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is append_checklist with the patch containing the Cause_of_Action and the extracted entries.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Emergency Motion to Quash Subpoena and/or for Protective Order and Memorandum of Law\", \"location\": \"tokens 2429-2629\"}, {\"text\": \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"location\": \"tokens 294-494\"}, {\"text\": \"sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"location\": \"tokens 7459-7659\"}, {\"text\": \"claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First Amendment\", \"source_document\": \"Order on the Merits\", \"location\": \"tokens 1252-1452\"}, {\"text\": \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"source_document\": \"Plaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief\", \"location\": \"tokens 14537-14737\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Cause_of_Action", "extracted": [{"value": "42 U.S.C. § 1983", "evidence": [{"text": "violated Plaintiff’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983", "source_document": "Emergency Motion to Quash Subpoena and/or for Protective Order and Memorandum of Law", "location": "tokens 2429-2629"}, {"text": "sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983", "source_document": "Opinion of the Court (001)", "location": "tokens 294-494"}, {"text": "sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983", "source_document": "Opinion of the Court (001)", "location": "tokens 7459-7659"}, {"text": "claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First Amendment", "source_document": "Order on the Merits", "location": "tokens 1252-1452"}, {"text": "pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983", "source_document": "Plaintiff-Appellant's Opening Brief", "location": "tokens 14537-14737"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18249, "completion_tokens": 3143, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 7, "run_id": "609a911a-06ca-4e8f-a980-3edae6dbad9c", "timestamp": "2025-11-16T00:48:40.005372-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from legal documents. So far, they've already done some steps: listed documents, read some, and did a regex search. The current status shows that they've found \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" as the cause of action from multiple documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's a bunch that haven't been fully read yet. The checklist item \"Cause_of_Action\" is supposed to capture the legal vehicles used, like statutes or Bivens. The existing evidence points to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But I need to make sure there aren't other causes mentioned.\n\nWait, the regex search they did earlier was for patterns like \"42 U.S.C. § \\d+\", \"Bivens\", etc. They found matches in several documents, but the extracted value is only \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". The user's last action was appending that value. Now, they need to check if there are more values to extract.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so the only key is Cause_of_Action, and it has one value. But the task says to extract EVERY distinct value. So maybe there are more instances. Let me check the documents they've read so far.\n\nThey read the Complaint, Docket, and Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Complaint's text (from the snapshot) doesn't mention the cause of action explicitly in the snippets provided. The Docket has entries about motions and filings but no explicit cause. The regex search found matches in Emergency Motion, Opinion of the Court, Order on the Merits, and Plaintiff-Appellant's Brief. The evidence they appended all point to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n\nWait, the regex pattern they used included \"Bivens\" and \"Title II of the ADA\", but the search results only found 42 U.S.C. § 1983. So maybe that's the only one. But the user needs to confirm if there are other causes. The next step should be to check if any other documents mention different causes. For example, maybe the \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim\" mentions a state law cause, but the checklist says not to include underlying rights or state law. The checklist specifies not to include state law claims (like Florida Constitution), so only federal causes. The existing evidence is all federal.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies (injunction, damages, declaratory relief), or procedural doctrines/rules (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young, standing, immunity).\" So the cause of action is the statute or doctrine that allows the suit, like 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The state law claim is not a cause of action for this purpose, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the only cause of action mentioned is 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But the user needs to make sure they haven't missed any other federal causes. The regex search didn't find any other patterns, so maybe that's the only one.\n\nThe next action should be to check if there are any other documents that might have additional causes. The available documents include things like \"Order on the Merits\" which was partially read, but they already got the 1983 reference from there. Other documents like \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss\" might mention other causes, but since the regex didn't find them, maybe they don't exist.\n\nWait, the user's current step is after appending the value. The next step is to decide whether to stop or continue. Since the checklist item is filled (they have one value, which is the only one), and there's no evidence of other causes, they should stop. But wait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so if there's only one, that's it.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 1\", and the key is filled. The empty keys are 0, so all keys are covered. The user should check if there's any other document that might have another cause. But the regex search was comprehensive, and they've read the documents where the cause was mentioned. The other documents are unvisited, but the regex didn't find any other matches, so it's unlikely they exist.\n\nThe system's stop criteria is when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, Cause_of_Action is complete with one value. So they should stop.\n\nWait, but the user's previous step was appending the checklist, and now they need to confirm. The next action should be to check the checklist again with get_checklist to ensure there are no other keys. But the only key is Cause_of_Action, which is filled. So they can stop.\n\nWait, the user's current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.

The user is trying to extract the \"Cause_of_Action\" from legal documents. They've already done several steps, and according to the current status, they have one value for Cause_of_Action: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". The checklist says to extract every distinct value, and they've confirmed it across multiple documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, most have been partially visited or are unvisited.

The user tried to stop at step 7, but the system made them do another check with get_checklist.\n\nNow, the current status shows 1/1 keys filled, 0 empty. The Extraction Progress says Cause_of_Action has 1 value from multiple documents. The user needs to confirm if there's anything else. But the checklist definition says not to include underlying rights or remedies, just the cause of action. The regex search they did earlier only found \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" multiple times, and no other causes like Bivens or Title II were found in the documents they checked.\n\nWait, the regex pattern included \"Bivens\", \"Title II of the ADA\", \"FTCA\", but the search results only had matches for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". So maybe those other causes aren't present in the documents. The user needs to make sure they didn't miss any. But the search was done on all documents, and only that one cause was found. The other documents are unvisited, but the regex search already covered all 29 documents and found only that one value. The search results listed 8 matches, all for 1983.\n\nThe user's step 5 was a search_document_regex on all docs with that pattern, and it found 8 matches, all related to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. So even though other documents are unvisited, the regex search would have found any instances of the other patterns if they existed. Since they didn't find any, it's safe to assume those causes aren't present.\n\nThe checklist status says all keys are filled. The user's step 7 tried to stop, but the system required a second stop attempt. Now, the current status confirms that Cause_of_Action has one value, no empty keys, and no Not Applicable needed. So the next step should be to stop again.\n\nThe system says \"stop attempt 1/2\", so they need to make a second stop. The reason is that all checklist items are fully extracted with evidence.
