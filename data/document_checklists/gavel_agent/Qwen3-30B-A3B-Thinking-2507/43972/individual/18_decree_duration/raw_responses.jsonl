The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value found.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The checklist specifies that it's for formal court orders like injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments. So, documents like \"Order\", \"Opinion of the Court\", \"Order on the Merits\", \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim...\", etc., are probably the key ones.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Order\" and \"Opinion\" types seem relevant. The \"Order on the Merits\" (22,422 tokens) might have a detailed decree. Also, the \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" (31,052 tokens) could contain the main judgment. But the user mentioned that the decree duration should be part of a court-ordered decree, not just a negotiated agreement.\n\nWait, the \"Order\" document is only 193 tokens. Maybe it's a short order, but it's possible it has the duration. However, the larger documents might be more likely to contain the specific details. The \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim...\" is 12k tokens, which could have a decree in it.\n\nBut since the user hasn't read any documents yet, the next step should be to read a document that's most likely to have the information. The \"Order on the Merits\" is a good candidate because it's a major order that would likely include the decree duration. It's 22k tokens, so reading the whole thing isn't possible in one go (max 10k tokens per read). So I should read the first 10k tokens of \"Order on the Merits\".\n\nWait, but the documents are listed as \"○ Unvisited\", so no tokens have been read yet. The user should start by reading a document. The \"Order on the Merits\" is a high-priority document for this task. Let me check the token count: 22,422 tokens. So reading from start to 10,000 tokens would be the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using regex to search for terms like \"decree\", \"duration\", \"injunction\", \"order\" might be efficient. But the problem says to use read_document as the default choice when targeting a specific document. Since the user has a specific document in mind (Order on the Merits), using read_document makes sense here.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Order on the Merits\". The parameters would be doc_name: \"Order on the Merits\", start_token: 0, end_token: 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order on the Merits\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order on the Merits", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4134, "completion_tokens": 640, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which should be the duration of court-ordered decrees like injunctions or consent decrees.\n\nFirst, I checked the provided document snapshot. The user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of \"Order on the Merits\" (tokens 0-10000). I need to analyze that text to see if there's any mention of a decree's duration.\n\nLooking at the document, it's a court order on the merits, concluding that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution but the Eleventh Amendment bars relief. The court entered judgment for the Governor. The order mentions \"entry of judgment for the Governor\" but doesn't specify a duration for any decree. There's no mention of an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment with a duration. The case is about a suspension, not a decree with a time limit.\n\nThe checklist specifies that only formal court orders like injunctions or consent decrees count. The order here is a judgment, not a decree with a duration. The court didn't issue a decree that lasts for a specific period; it just dismissed the case against the Governor.\n\nSince the document doesn't mention any decree duration, and the user's task is to extract every distinct value found, but there are none here, I need to check if any other documents might contain this information. The current status shows \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty, and all other documents are unvisited. The next step should be to search other documents for the term \"decree\" or \"duration\" using regex to find where the duration might be specified.\n\nThe available documents include \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" (12,265 tokens), which might have relevant info. But the user hasn't read it yet. However, the current action requires choosing one step. Since the current document (Order on the Merits) didn't yield any value, the next logical step is to search other documents for the regex pattern related to decree duration.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract the duration, so the regex should look for phrases like \"decree duration\", \"lasts for\", \"term\", etc. But the checklist says to extract as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So the regex could be something like \"duration.*?(\\d+|[\\w\\s]+) days|months|years\" but maybe more precise.\n\nLooking at the tools, the search_document_regex function can be used. The pattern should be designed to find relevant sections. Since the current document didn't have it, searching all unvisited documents makes sense. But the user should target specific documents if possible. However, the available documents include \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\", which is an executive order, not a decree. But maybe the order includes a decree. Wait, the executive order is the suspension order, which is different from a decree.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment\". The main document read so far is an order on the merits, which is a court order but it's a dismissal, not a decree with a duration. The case didn't result in a decree; the judgment was for the Governor.\n\nSo, perhaps the decree duration isn't present in this case. But the user has to check all documents. The next step is to search other documents. The \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" might have something, but executive orders aren't court decrees. The court's orders (like the Order on the Merits) might not have a decree duration. Wait, the user needs to check all documents. Since the current document didn't have it, and the checklist item is empty, the next action should be to search other documents for the term \"decree\" or \"duration\" to find where it's mentioned.\n\nSo, the correct action here is to use `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"decree duration|decree will last|duration of the decree|term of the decree\" to find relevant sections. The pattern should be case-insensitive and might need to look for phrases indicating duration.\n\nThe parameters for `search_document_regex` would be:\n- doc_name: 'all' (to search all unvisited documents)\n- pattern: \"decree duration|duration of decree|decree will last|term of decree\"\n- flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]\n- top_k: 5\n- context_tokens: 200\n\nThis will search all unvisited documents for these phrases and return matches with context, which can then be read to extract the duration.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"decree duration|duration of decree|decree will last|term of decree\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "decree duration|duration of decree|decree will last|term of decree", "doc_name": "all", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14746, "completion_tokens": 1045, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which requires the duration of any court-ordered decree, like an injunction or consent decree. The task is to find all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, the only key is empty. The previous step tried a regex search for \"decree duration\" across all 29 documents but found 0 matches. The document catalog shows that \"Order on the Merits\" was partially read (tokens 0-10,000), but the search didn't find anything. The next step is to decide which action to take.\n\nThe user's recent actions were list_documents (found 29 docs), read_document on Order on the Merits (first 10k tokens), and then a regex search on all docs for decree duration terms. The regex search returned zero matches. Now, the system needs to proceed.\n\nWait, the Order on the Merits was read, but the regex search didn't find anything. Maybe the term \"decree\" isn't used in that document. The Order on the Merits is the main opinion document. The court ordered judgment for the Governor, so there's no decree in favor of the plaintiff. The case is about a suspension, not a decree. The order says \"entry of judgment for the Governor,\" so no decree is issued. That might be why the regex didn't find anything.\n\nBut the checklist specifies \"only include obligations that are ordered by the court.\" If there's no decree, then the item should be marked as Not Applicable. However, the system requires evidence for Not Applicable. The user needs to confirm if there's any decree mentioned. Since the Order on the Merits says \"entry of judgment for the Governor\" and doesn't mention any decree duration, it's possible that there's no decree. But the regex search didn't find any matches, so maybe the term \"decree\" isn't used. The court might refer to \"judgment\" instead of \"decree.\"\n\nWait, the checklist says \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" So \"judgment\" might be the term used. The Order on the Merits says \"entry of judgment,\" so maybe the judgment doesn't include a duration. The order concludes that the suspension violated the Constitution but the Eleventh Amendment bars relief, so judgment is entered for the Governor. There's no injunction or decree ordered by the court against the Governor. The plaintiff (Warren) didn't get an injunction; the court dismissed his claims. So there's no decree duration to extract.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to set \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" to Not Applicable. But the user must use update_checklist with a single entry \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence should be the text from the document stating that there's no decree, or that the judgment was entered for the Governor without any decree.\n\nLooking at the Order on the Merits, page 2: \"This order thus directs entry of judgment for the Governor.\" There's no mention of a decree or its duration. The court didn't issue any decree; it just entered judgment for the defendant. So the evidence would be that the judgment was entered for the Governor, no decree was issued.\n\nSo, the next action should be to use update_checklist to set the key to Not Applicable. The evidence would be the quote from the document: \"This order thus directs entry of judgment for the Governor.\" Since there's no decree, the duration isn't applicable.\n\nWait, but the system requires that Not Applicable is set via update_checklist with the exact value \"Not Applicable\". The evidence must be explicit. The document states that judgment was entered for the Governor, meaning no decree was issued against the Governor. So the evidence supports that the decree duration doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is update_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" and the extracted value as [\"Not Applicable\"], with evidence from the document.\n\nNeed to check if there are other documents that might have a decree. But the regex search found nothing, and the only document read so far (Order on the Merits) doesn't have it. The other documents are unvisited, but since the regex didn't find any matches in all documents, maybe it's safe to conclude it's Not Applicable. However, the system's policy says not to mark Not Applicable just because you didn't find it; you need explicit evidence. The Order on the Merits explicitly states that judgment was entered for the Governor, so there's no decree. That's sufficient evidence.\n\nSo the action is update_checklist with the key and the Not Applicable entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This order thus directs entry of judgment for the Governor.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order on the Merits\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2, line 12\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "This order thus directs entry of judgment for the Governor.", "source_document": "Order on the Merits", "location": "Page 2, line 12"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14791, "completion_tokens": 1119, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The requirement states that a key is Not Applicable only if the evidence explicitly supports it, like a dismissal without a decree or a case where no decree was issued.\n\nLooking at the Order on the Merits, it says the court entered judgment for the Governor, meaning the plaintiff (Andrew Warren) lost. The order concludes with \"entry of judgment for the Governor,\" which implies there's no decree imposed on the defendant (the Governor). Since the decree duration applies to court-ordered decrees (like injunctions or consent decrees), and here the court is ruling in favor of the defendant without issuing any such decree, it's accurate to mark this as Not Applicable.\n\nThe recent actions show that step 4 used `update_checklist` to set \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the document.
