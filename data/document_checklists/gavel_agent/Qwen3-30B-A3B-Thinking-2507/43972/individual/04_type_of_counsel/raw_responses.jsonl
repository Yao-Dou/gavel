The checklist item is empty, and the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. The checklist item is Type_of_Counsel, and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows all keys are empty. There are 29 documents, all unvisited. The task is to find the type of counsel for each side (plaintiff and defendant), using specific labels.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, the next step should be to read a document that's most likely to contain counsel information. The Complaint is a good starting point because it usually lists the parties and their counsel. The Complaint document has 1,431 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for read_document.\n\nI should call read_document on the Complaint. Let me check the document catalog: Complaint [Complaint] is listed as unvisited. The token count is 1,431, so reading the whole thing is possible. No need for regex search here since the Complaint is a standard document where counsel info is typically present.\n\nWait, the instructions say to use read_document as the default choice when targeting a specific document. So, reading the Complaint makes sense. The other documents like Pleadings might have counsel info too, but starting with the Complaint is logical.\n\nI need to make sure not to read any document that's already visited, but all are unvisited. So, proceed with reading the Complaint from start to end (tokens 0-1431).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1431}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1431}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4160, "completion_tokens": 345, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist says to get the type of counsel for each side, like Plaintiff or Defendant, using specific labels.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they read the Complaint document (tokens 0-1431). In the Complaint, there's a verification statement from Andrew H. Warren, who's the Plaintiff. He mentions he's the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit. So his counsel is government counsel, specifically as a State Attorney.\n\nWait, the requirement says to include specific organizations in parentheses if available. Here, he's the State Attorney, so it's \"government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\". But the example given was \"government counsel\", so maybe just \"government counsel\" is enough. But the instruction says to include specific orgs if available. So maybe \"government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\".\n\nAlso, the Defendant's counsel isn't mentioned in the Complaint. The Complaint is from the Plaintiff, so the Defendant (the State, probably) might be represented by government counsel as well, but the document doesn't specify. The problem says not to include an entry if it's not clear. Since the Complaint only mentions the Plaintiff's counsel, we can't assume the Defendant's. So only Plaintiff's type is extracted here.\n\nThe Complaint's verification says \"I am the elected State Attorney...\", so that's the Plaintiff's counsel. So the value should be \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be the verbatim text. The relevant part is: \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\" So the text is that line.\n\nSource document is \"Complaint\", location is page 28 (since the token range was up to page 28). Wait, the document's page numbers go up to 28, and the verification is on page 28. So location would be \"Page 28\".\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\" with the evidence from that line.\n\nNow, the checklist item \"Type_of_Counsel\" is currently empty. We need to append this value. Since it's the first entry, we should use append_checklist. The evidence must have the text, source, and location.\n\nWait, the example in the requirements says to format each side as separate entries, so \"Plaintiff: ...\" and \"Defendant: ...\". Since we only have Plaintiff here, we just have that one entry.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the key \"Type_of_Counsel\", and the extracted array containing this single entry with the evidence.\n\nCheck the parameters for append_checklist: the patch should have key and extracted array. Each extracted entry needs evidence (array of evidence objects) and value.\n\nSo the evidence object would have text: \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\", source_document: \"Complaint\", location: \"Page 28\".\n\nWait, the actual text in the document is: \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\" So that's the verbatim text.\n\nSo the value to extract is \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\".\n\nWait, the instruction says to use brief category labels and include specific orgs. The State Attorney's office is the specific org, so \"government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\".\n\nBut the value should be \"Plaintiff: [the label]\". So the full value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\".\n\nYes, that matches the example given in the checklist: \"Plaintiff: …\".\n\nSo the extracted value is that string.\n\nNow, confirm that the document is fully visited (it's marked as ✓ Fully Visited), but since we just read it, we can append the value. The system says not to reread, but we already read it, so the next step is to append the extracted value.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the patch containing Type_of_Counsel and the extracted entry.\n\nNo need for update_checklist here because it's the first entry. Append is correct.\n\nCheck if there are other possible entries in the Complaint. The Complaint is from the Plaintiff, and the Defendant isn't mentioned in terms of counsel, so no Defendant entry here. So only one entry.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 28\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of evidence objects, each with text, source, location. So the evidence array here has one entry.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the next action is to append that checklist item.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 28\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)", "evidence": [{"text": "I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 28"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5703, "completion_tokens": 1295, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, they've read the Complaint document and found that the Plaintiff is \"government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office)\" based on the verification statement.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have one value for Type_of_Counsel. The checklist requires extracting all distinct values, including separate entries for Plaintiff and Defendant. The Complaint only mentions the Plaintiff's counsel, so the Defendant's side hasn't been covered yet. The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and other briefs might have that info.\n\nThe available documents are mostly unvisited. The next step should be to check documents that might contain Defendant's counsel information. The Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law (16,352 tokens) is a good candidate since it's a key document from the Defendant's side. Also, the Defendant's Motion for Protective Order and other motions might have similar info.\n\nBut the user can only do one action per turn. The current state shows that the Complaint is fully visited, so they shouldn't read it again. The next logical step is to read the Defendant's main motion document to see if it mentions the Defendant's counsel. Since the Defendant's counsel might be listed in their motion, reading that document (Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss) would be the best choice. The token count is 16,352, but they can read a window of up to 10,000 tokens. Starting from 0-10,000 tokens of that document.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex might be faster if they can find a pattern like \"Counsel for Defendant\" or \"Defendant's counsel\". But the problem says to use read_document as the default. The user should probably read the document first to check for the counsel info. So the next action should be read_document on \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law\" from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 10000\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5814, "completion_tokens": 503, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, I've only got one value from the Complaint: Plaintiff: government counsel (Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office). But the checklist requires me to get both sides, right? The Defendant's side hasn't been covered yet.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Defendant's Consolidated Motion document was partially read (tokens 0-10000), but the text provided ends around page 23. The document is 16,352 tokens, so there's still 6,352 tokens left. Wait, but the user's recent action was a read_document on that document up to 10,000 tokens. The next step should be to check if there's more relevant info in the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, the Defendant's Motion document mentions \"Ron DeSantis, individually and in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Florida\" as the Defendant. So the Defendant is the Governor, which would be government counsel. But the document doesn't explicitly say \"government counsel\" for the Defendant. However, since the Defendant is a government official (Governor), it's implied that the counsel is government counsel. But I need to make sure there's evidence in the text.\n\nLooking at the provided text from the Defendant's Motion, it's a legal brief filed by the Defendant (the Governor's office). The document starts with \"DEFENDANT’S CONSOLIDATED MOTION TO DISMISS...\" and is signed by the Defendant's counsel. Wait, but in the text provided, the document's header says \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". The actual counsel isn't explicitly named here. The document is filed by the Defendant, who is the Governor, so the counsel would be government counsel. But I need to find where it's stated.\n\nWait, in the text, it says \"Ron DeSantis, individually and in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Florida, Defendant.\" So the Defendant is the Governor, which is a government position. Therefore, the Defendant's counsel would be government counsel. But the document doesn't say \"government counsel\" explicitly. However, the checklist's definition says to use \"government counsel\" as a category. So even if it's not stated, since the Defendant is a government official, the counsel type is government counsel.\n\nBut the evidence needs to be verbatim. The text says \"Defendant. Defendant's Consolidated Motion...\" So the Defendant is the Governor, so the counsel is government counsel. The evidence would be the document's title and the Defendant's description. Wait, the document is titled \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion...\", so the Defendant is the one filing the motion, which is the Governor, so the counsel is government counsel. But do I need a direct quote? The checklist requires evidence with \"text\" (verbatim snippet), so I need to find where it's stated.\n\nWait, the text provided doesn't have the attorney's name or the firm. The motion is filed by the Defendant, who is the Governor, so the counsel would be the state's attorneys. But since it's not explicitly stated in the provided text, maybe I need to check if there's a mention elsewhere. However, the document was partially read up to 10,000 tokens, and the text stops at page 23. The remaining tokens might have the counsel's name.\n\nWait, the document is a motion filed by the Defendant (the Governor), so the counsel would be the Office of the Attorney General of Florida, but it's not stated here. However, the checklist requires that if the type is clear, extract it. Since the Defendant is a government official, it's government counsel. But the evidence must be from the document. The text mentions \"Defendant\" as \"Ron DeSantis, individually and in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Florida\", so the Defendant is the government, hence government counsel. The evidence would be the line where it says \"Defendant\" in the case caption. So I can use that as evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist says: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So if it's clear that the Defendant is a government official, then the counsel is government counsel. The evidence would be the case caption: \"Ron DeSantis, individually and in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Florida, Defendant.\" So that's the evidence. Therefore, Defendant: government counsel.\n\nSo the next step is to append the Defendant's counsel type. Since the text is from the Defendant's Motion document, which is partially visited, but the relevant part (the case caption) is in the first few pages. Wait, the text provided starts with the case caption on Page 1: \"ANDREW H. WARREN, Plaintiff, v. RON DESANTIS, individually and in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Florida, Defendant.\" So that's in the document, which is already read (tokens 0-10000). So the evidence is in the document.\n\nTherefore, I should append the Defendant's counsel as government counsel. The evidence would be the case caption line.\n\nSo the new entry would be: Defendant: government counsel.\n\nThe source document is \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", location is Page 1 (since the case caption is on the first page).\n\nWait, the document's first page shows the case caption. The text provided starts with \"Case 4:22-cv-00302-RH-MAF Document 30 Filed 09/02/22 Page 1 of 39\" followed by the caption. So the evidence is from Page 1 of that document.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to append the new value for Type_of_Counsel. Since the previous action was a read_document on that document, and now I've analyzed the text, I need to use append_checklist to add the Defendant's entry.\n\nWait, the previous action was Step 4: read_document on that document. Now, after analyzing the text, I need to append the new value. So the next action is append_checklist with the new value.\n\nThe existing value is Plaintiff: government counsel (from Complaint). Now adding Defendant: government counsel (from Defendant's Motion).\n\nSo the patch would be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Defendant: government counsel\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"ANDREW H.
