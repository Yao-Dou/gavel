The user needs me to extract the statutory or constitutional basis for the case from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", and I need to find all distinct values mentioned in the documents.\n\nFirst, I should check the current status. The snapshot says there are 29 documents, all unvisited (marked with ○). The checklist item is empty, so I need to start reading documents to find the relevant information.\n\nThe task requires extracting specific legal bases like constitutional amendments or statutes (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment, ADA Title II). I must avoid including causes of action (like 42 U.S.C. § 1983) or procedural doctrines. Each distinct basis should be a separate entry with evidence.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is the most likely place to find the statutory basis since it typically states the legal claims. The Complaint is 1,431 tokens, which is under the 10,000 token limit for a read_document call. Since it's unvisited, I should read the entire document to find the relevant sections.\n\nOther documents like the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction might also contain this info, but the Complaint is the primary source for the legal basis. Starting with the Complaint makes sense to avoid unnecessary searches.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint, starting at token 0 and ending at 1431 (the full document). This will give me the text to analyze for the statutory basis.\n\nNo regex search is needed yet because the target is a specific document, not a pattern. The regex tool is for when you know the pattern but not the document, but here the document is known (Complaint), so reading it directly is better.\n\nAfter reading the Complaint, I'll check the text for mentions of constitutional provisions or statutes. Once I find them, I'll use append_checklist to add the values with evidence. If I don't find anything in the Complaint, I'll move to the next likely document, like the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nBut for now, the first step is to read the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1431}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1431}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4224, "completion_tokens": 493, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

So far, they've read the Complaint document (tokens 0-1431), but in the provided text, there's no mention of any specific constitutional or statutory provisions. The verification statement at the end just mentions the complaint being filed, but no actual legal basis.\n\nLooking at the current status: the key is empty, and they've already fully visited the Complaint document. The next step would be to check other documents where such a basis might be mentioned. The Complaint is the first document, but maybe the motion for preliminary injunction or the defendant's motions contain the basis.\n\nWait, the checklist says to avoid the cause of action (like 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and focus on the substantive rights violated. So maybe the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (which is listed as a document) would have the basis. Let me check the available documents. There's a \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" with 83 tokens. That's a small document, but maybe it contains the basis. Alternatively, the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might have it, but it's larger. However, since the Complaint didn't have it, the next logical step is to read the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which is a short document (83 tokens), so it's efficient to read that next.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading the Complaint, which was fully visited. Now, the next document to check would be the one that's most likely to contain the statutory basis. The Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (83 tokens) is a good candidate because motions often cite the legal basis. So, I should use read_document on that document. The document name is \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" and it's unvisited, so I'll read the entire document since it's only 83 tokens, which is under 10,000.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows it as 83 tokens and unvisited. So reading the whole thing (tokens 0-83) should be safe. Let me confirm: the parameters need start_token and end_token. Since it's 83 tokens, start 0, end 83. That's a valid call. No need for regex here because the document is small and likely to contain the basis in its text. So the next action should be read_document on \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" from 0 to 83.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 83}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 83}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5767, "completion_tokens": 610, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the statutory or constitutional basis from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\". So far, they've read the Complaint and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, but those didn't have any relevant info.\n\nLooking at the documents listed, most are unvisited. The Complaint was fully read (tokens 0-1431), but the text provided in the snapshot doesn't mention any constitutional or statutory bases. The verification part just talks about the plaintiff's role. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction was only 83 tokens and seems to be just headers.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents that might contain the basis. The key is to find where the legal arguments are made, like in the Complaint's body, but since the Complaint was read and didn't have it, maybe other documents like the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or the Order on the Merits might have it.\n\nWait, the Complaint's text shown ends with the verification statement, but the actual legal basis would be in the body of the complaint. The user read up to page 28, but maybe the basis was mentioned earlier. Wait, the snapshot shows the Complaint from pages 1-28, but the actual content given starts from the verification on page 28. Wait, the text provided in Step 2 is from page 1 to 28, but the content after page 16 is cut off. Wait, the user's Step 2 says they read tokens 0-1431 of the Complaint, but the sample text they provided starts at page 1 and goes to page 28, but the actual content in the sample is mostly headers and the verification on page 28. So maybe the legal basis was in the earlier pages, but the user didn't include it in the snapshot. Wait, but the user's Step 2 says they read tokens 0-1431, which is the entire Complaint, but the text they pasted only shows the headers and the verification. Maybe the actual content of the complaint (the allegations) is missing here. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that in Step 2, they read the Complaint tokens 0-1431, and the text they provided is the headers and the verification. So perhaps the actual legal basis isn't in the Complaint as per the given text. So maybe the basis is in another document, like the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, which might reference the constitutional claims.\n\nThe available documents include \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law\" which is 16,352 tokens. That's a likely candidate because motions to dismiss often cite the legal basis. So the next action should be to read a portion of that document, maybe the beginning where the legal arguments are presented.\n\nBut the user's current state says that the Complaint is fully visited, so they shouldn't read it again. The next step is to choose a document that's unvisited and likely to contain the statutory basis. The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is a good candidate. Since it's unvisited, they need to read it. The token count is 16,352, so they can read a portion, say the first 10,000 tokens (0-10000) to cover the beginning where the legal arguments would be.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex to look for terms like \"constitutional\" or \"statutory\" might be efficient. But the user's policy says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since the basis is likely to be mentioned with specific terms, maybe a regex search would be better. But the problem says to use read_document as default. However, the user might want to search for \"Fourteenth Amendment\" or similar terms.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract specific constitutional provisions or statutes. So the regex pattern could be something like r'(?:Fourteenth Amendment|First Amendment|Eighth Amendment|ADA Title II|Rehab Act § 504|42 U.S.C. § 1983)', but the note says not to include the cause of action (like 42 U.S.C. § 1983), so maybe avoid that. So maybe look for the amendment names or statutes like \"ADA Title II\".\n\nBut the user has to choose one action. The available documents are many, but the most likely to have the basis is the Complaint, but it's already fully read. Wait, but the Complaint was read and didn't show the basis in the provided text. So maybe the basis is in another document. The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss might reference it. So the next step is to read that document.\n\nThe safest action is to read the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, starting from token 0 to 10,000. That's within the 10,000 token limit. So the action would be read_document with doc_name \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law\" and start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex on all documents to find mentions of constitutional or statutory bases. But the user's policy says to use read_document as default. Since the user hasn't found anything yet, and the Complaint was read without success, the next step is to check another document. The Motion to Dismiss is a strong candidate.\n\nWait, the problem states that the user has to extract all distinct values. Since the current state shows 0 values, they need to find the first instance. So the next action should be to read a document likely to contain the basis. The Motion to Dismiss is a good bet. So the correct action is read_document on that document for the first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5923, "completion_tokens": 1289, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the statutory or constitutional basis for the case from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", which requires specific constitutional provisions or statutes violated, not the cause of action (like 42 U.S.C. § 1983).\n\nLooking at the recent actions:\n- They read the Complaint (tokens 0-1431) but the text provided only shows the verification under 28 U.S.C. § 1746, which is procedural, not the basis for the case. So no relevant evidence there.\n- They read Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (tokens 0-83), but it's just a cover page with no substantive content.\n- They read Defendant's Consolidated Motion (tokens 0-10000), which is the main document they've partially read. This document discusses constitutional arguments extensively.\n\nIn the Defendant's Motion, I see key sections:\n- Page 3: Mentions \"First Amendment\" and \"Florida Constitution\" as the basis for the case. Specifically, the plaintiff claims the Governor violated \"both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution.\"\n- Pages 7-15: Deep dive into First Amendment arguments, citing Garcetti v. Ceballos, Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., etc.\n- Page 19: References \"Florida Constitution\" in the context of quo warranto claims.\n\nThe checklist requires distinct values. From the text, I can extract:\n1. \"First Amendment\" (as the federal constitutional basis)\n2. \"Florida Constitution\" (as the state constitutional basis)\n\nI need to verify if these are the actual bases alleged, not just mentioned. The motion states: \"He argues that the Governor, in exercising his authority to suspend state officials guilty of neglect of duty and incompetence, violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution.\" This confirms both are the alleged bases.\n\nFor evidence:\n- For \"First Amendment\": Page 3, line \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\"\n- For \"Florida Constitution\": Same location, and further supported on page 19 where it discusses \"Florida Constitution\" in the quo warranto argument.\n\nNow, checking if these are distinct and properly categorized. The First Amendment is a constitutional provision, and the Florida Constitution is a state constitutional basis. Both are explicitly cited as the \"what\" was violated (not the cause of action like § 1983).\n\nNo other bases are mentioned. The motion references statutes like Florida Constitution art. IV, § 1 and § 7, but those are the sources of the Governor's authority, not the alleged violation. The violation is the constitutional rights themselves (First Amendment, Florida Const.).\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n- \"First Amendment\" with evidence from page 3\n- \"Florida Constitution\" with evidence from page 3 and page 19\n\nI need to use `append_checklist` to add these, as they're new entries. Each needs proper evidence with text snippet, source document, and location.\n\nWait, the Defendant's Motion is the source document, and the locations are page 3 and page 19. The text snippets should be verbatim.\n\nFor \"First Amendment\":\n- Text: \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\"\n- Source: \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"\n- Location: Page 3\n\nFor \"Florida Constitution\":\n- Text: \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\" (same as above) and \"Florida Constitution\" on page 19\n- But to be precise, I should use the page 19 reference too: \"DE3-1:17–27 (predicating Count 2 on “Florida State law,” specifically the contention that “[t]he Governor has unlawfully suspended Warren in violation of the Florida Constitution”)\"\n\nWait, the evidence must be verbatim. On page 3: \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\" is the key phrase. On page 19, it's referenced again as \"Florida Constitution\" in the context of the violation.\n\nBut the checklist says \"prefer clause-level detail when available\". Here, it's just \"First Amendment\" and \"Florida Constitution\" without specific clauses. That's acceptable since the document doesn't specify clauses.\n\nSo both values are valid and distinct.\n\nNow, I need to structure the `append_checklist` with these two entries.\n\nCheck if the document has been fully visited. The Defendant's Motion has 16,352 tokens, and they read up to 10,000 tokens (61% coverage). The relevant text is in the early pages (pages 1-3), which are within 0-10000 tokens. So it's covered.\n\nNo need to read more; the evidence is already in the text they've read.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append these two values to the checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"First Amendment\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"location\": \"Page 3\"}]}]}, {\"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Florida Constitution\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"location\": \"Page 3\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case", "extracted": [{"value": "First Amendment", "evidence": [{"text": "violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution", "source_document": "Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 3"}]}]}, {"key": "Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case", "extracted": [{"value": "Florida Constitution", "evidence": [{"text": "violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution", "source_document": "Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16526, "completion_tokens": 1258, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", and I need to find all distinct values.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted two values: \"First Amendment\" and \"Florida Constitution\" from the Defendant's Consolidated Motion. Both came from the same document (Page 3), where it says \"violated both the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution\". \n\nBut wait, the requirements say to extract each distinct basis as a separate value. So \"First Amendment\" and \"Florida Constitution\" are two different values, which they've already done. The user's recent action (Step 5) successfully appended both values with the correct evidence.\n\nNow, checking the document catalog: The Defendant's document is only partially visited (61% coverage, tokens 0-10000). The rest of the document (tokens 10001-16352) hasn't been read yet. Maybe there's more information about constitutional bases in the unvisited part.\n\nBut the user's instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"When reading partially visited documents, read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" So I should check if there's any evidence in the unvisited part (10001-16352) that might add more statutory or constitutional bases.\n\nHowever, the current checklist has only one key (\"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\") with two values already extracted. The extraction progress shows 2 values from the same document. Since they're asking for distinct values, and they've already got both mentioned in the text, I don't think there's a need to read more of that document unless there's a chance of finding additional bases.\n\nWait, the user's Step 5 already appended both values. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning the one key is fully covered. The \"Empty Keys\" and \"Not Applicable\" are both 0/1. So all required values for this key are extracted.\n\nBut let me double-check: The checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value... Prefer clause-level detail...\". The extracted values are \"First Amendment\" and \"Florida Constitution\" - these are distinct and match the requirement.

The current status shows the key has 2 values.\n\nSince the key is fully extracted and no other values are expected (as the document only mentions those two), and no other documents are likely to add more (since the Complaint didn't have them, and the motion they read already captured both), I should stop.\n\nThe user's \"Current Status\" says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning the one key is done.
