Since the corpus has 0 documents, the system can't proceed to read or search any documents. The decision policy says that if the document catalog is unknown, the correct action is to call `list_documents`. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the function that returns all documents with their metadata. Without knowing the documents, there's no way to proceed further. So the next logical step is to list the documents to get the catalog updated.\n\nThe user's current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, definitely, the first action should be to call `list_documents` to discover what documents exist. That's the only option here. The other actions like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require existing documents, which aren't present yet.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not skipping any steps. The system's decision policy clearly states: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is unknown. So the correct action is to call `list_documents` now. No other action makes sense here because there's nothing to read or search without documents.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to issue the `list_documents` function call.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3123, "completion_tokens": 355, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The current status shows 0 values extracted out of 1, with all keys empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document to read first. The available documents include a Complaint, Docket, various Orders, and Pleadings. The Complaint is the most likely place to find the parties listed, as it typically names the plaintiff and defendant at the beginning.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Complaint is 1,431 tokens and unvisited. Since it's the first document and the most relevant for party identification, I should read it. The user mentioned not to reread visited documents, but this one hasn't been touched yet. \n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint. The start_token should be 0, and end_token can be the full document size, 1,431 tokens. Wait, the maximum is 10,000, so 1,431 is safe. The Docket is larger but might have the parties listed there too, but the Complaint is the primary place. \n\nCheck if there's any regex pattern to search, but since the user wants the parties, which are usually explicitly stated, reading the Complaint directly makes sense. Using search_document_regex might not be as efficient here because the parties are likely in the header or early part, so reading the whole document is better.\n\nSo the next action is to call read_document on the Complaint from token 0 to 1431.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1431}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1431}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4107, "completion_tokens": 375, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the parties involved from legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The task is to find every distinct value, formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the Complaint document (tokens 0-1431) and found a verification statement from Andrew H. Warren. In that statement, he says he's the \"elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\" So that's a clear mention of the plaintiff.\n\nWait, but the complaint is Document 1, and they've already read it. The current status shows that the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" key is empty. But in the Complaint, there's a verification statement where Andrew H. Warren identifies himself as the Plaintiff. So that's one value: \"Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\"\n\nNow, the next step is to append this value to the checklist. The user needs to use `append_checklist` because they're adding a new entry. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe document is \"Complaint\", the location is the verification section on page 28 (since it's the last page mentioned in the text), and the exact quote is \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\"\n\nWait, the text shows \"Plaintiff in this case\" so the value should be \"Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\" But the exact wording in the document says \"the Plaintiff in this case,\" so the description is \"elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\"\n\nSo the extracted value would be \"Plaintiff: elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit\" but wait, the full description should include his name. Wait, the verification statement says \"I, Andrew H. Warren, state as follows: I am the elected State Attorney... and the Plaintiff in this case.\" So the plaintiff's description is \"Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\"\n\nTherefore, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\"\n\nThe evidence needs the text snippet: \"I am the elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit and the Plaintiff in this case.\" Source document: \"Complaint\", location: \"Page 28\" (since the page numbers go up to 28).\n\nWait, the document says \"Page 28 of 28\" and the verification is on that page. So location is \"Page 28\".\n\nNow, the user has to append this entry. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", so the key is that. The extracted list should have this new entry.\n\nSo the correct action is `append_checklist` with the patch containing the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" and the extracted entry with the value and evidence.\n\nNo need to check other documents yet because the plaintiff is found in the Complaint. The defendant might be mentioned elsewhere, but the task is to extract all distinct values. The current step is to process the found value from the Complaint.\n\nWait, the defendant isn't mentioned in the Complaint text provided. The user's recent action read the Complaint, and the only party mentioned there is the plaintiff. So for now, only the plaintiff is extracted. The defendant might be in other documents, but the next step is to append the found value.\n\nSo the next action is to append the extracted value from the Complaint. The user hasn't done that yet, as the current status shows 0 values extracted.

The user needs to extract the parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. So far, they've read the Complaint document (tokens 0-1431) and found one value: Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit.\n\nNow, the current status shows that 1 out of 1 keys has a value, but the system says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\". Wait, but the checklist only has one item, \"Who_are_the_Parties\". The user needs to check if there are more parties mentioned in other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, most are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read that again. The next step is to check other documents that might contain party information. The key is to find other parties, like defendants. The current extracted value is only the plaintiff. The defendant here is likely the State of Florida or Governor Ron DeSantis, as mentioned in the Complaint's verification statement.\n\nThe Complaint mentions \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis\" in the verification. But the extracted value so far is only the plaintiff. The defendant should be the State of Florida or Governor DeSantis. Wait, the user's checklist requires both plaintiff and defendant. The current entry only has the plaintiff. So the defendant is missing.\n\nThe document says \"Plaintiff in this case\" refers to Andrew H. Warren, and the defendant would be the State of Florida or Governor DeSantis. The Complaint might have the defendant listed in the caption. The initial pages (like page 1) might have the defendant's name. But the user only read up to page 28, but the token range was 0-1431. The provided text shows the verification statement on page 28. Maybe the defendant is listed on the first page.\n\nWait, the Complaint's first page (page 1) is part of the tokens 0-1431. The user read tokens 0-1431, which includes pages 1-28. But in the provided text snippet, they only showed the verification statement from page 28. The actual defendant might be on the first page. For example, in legal complaints, the caption usually lists plaintiff vs. defendant.\n\nThe user's current extracted value is only the plaintiff. The defendant hasn't been extracted yet. So they need to check if the defendant is mentioned in the Complaint or other documents. But since the Complaint was fully read, maybe the defendant is there. Wait, the provided text for the Complaint includes the verification statement, but not the caption. The user's read_document output shows pages 1-28, but the actual text provided starts with the case number and page numbers, then the verification. Maybe the defendant's name is in the caption on page 1.\n\nWait, the user's read_document output shows:\n\n\"Case 4:22-cv-00302-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 08/17/22   Page 1 of 28\"\n\nBut the actual text they provided for the read document starts with the case number and page numbers, then the verification on page 28. The defendant's name is likely in the caption on page 1. For example, the complaint might start with \"Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit vs. Defendant: State of Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis\".\n\nBut the user's current extracted value only has the plaintiff. The defendant is missing. So they need to check if the defendant is mentioned in the Complaint. Since the Complaint was fully read (tokens 0-1431, 100% coverage), they should have seen the caption. Wait, but the provided text snippet doesn't include the caption. The user's read_document output shows the page numbers but not the actual content of the first few pages. Wait, no, the user provided the text that was read, which starts from page 1 to 28, but the actual content of the complaint's caption might not be in the text they pasted. Wait, looking at the user's Step 2: they read the Complaint (tokens 0-1431), and the text they pasted shows the page numbers from 1-28, then the verification on page 28. But the actual complaint text (the legal content) might not be in the provided text. Wait, no, the user included the text from the document, but maybe they only included the verification statement. Wait, the text they provided starts with the case number on each page, then the verification on page 28. So perhaps the actual complaint's body, including the parties, wasn't included in the token range they read? Wait, the token range was 0-1431, which they say is 100% coverage. But the text provided in the example doesn't show the parties' names except in the verification statement.\n\nWait, the verification statement says \"the Plaintiff in this case\" and mentions Governor Ron DeSantis as someone who issued an Executive Order. So the defendant is likely the State of Florida or Governor DeSantis. But the user's current extracted value is only the plaintiff. The defendant's name hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nSo, the next step is to check if the defendant is mentioned in the Complaint. Since the Complaint was fully read, maybe the defendant's name is in the caption. Wait, but the user's read_document output didn't include the caption's text. Maybe the token range they read included the caption, but the text they provided (the example) only shows the verification part. Wait, the user's Step 2 says they read tokens 0-1431 of the Complaint, and the text they pasted includes the page numbers up to 28, then the verification. But the actual complaint's caption (which lists parties) is probably on page 1. So the user might have missed it because the text they pasted doesn't show it. But according to the system, the document was fully read, so the caption should be there. However, the user's current extracted value only has the plaintiff. So perhaps the defendant needs to be added.\n\nWait, the checklist requires \"Plaintiff: [description]\" and \"Defendant: [description]\". The user has one value for Plaintiff, but no Defendant. So they need to find the Defendant.\n\nBut since the Complaint was fully read, maybe the Defendant is mentioned there. Let's assume that in the Complaint's caption (page 1), it says something like \"Andrew H. Warren, Plaintiff, v. State of Florida, Defendant\". So the user needs to extract \"Defendant: State of Florida\" or \"Defendant: Governor Ron DeSantis\".\n\nBut the user's current extracted value only has the plaintiff. So they need to check if the defendant is in the Complaint. Since the Complaint is fully visited, they should have the information. Wait, but the user's read_document output didn't include the caption's text. Maybe the token range 0-1431 includes the caption, but the user didn't provide it in the example. So perhaps the defendant's name is in the Complaint, and the user hasn't extracted it yet. Therefore, they should use get_checklist to see if there's more to extract from the Complaint.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" key has one value. But that value is only the plaintiff. The defendant is missing. So the key should have two values: one for plaintiff and one for defendant. But the user hasn't extracted the defendant yet.\n\nSo the next step is to check if the defendant is present in the Complaint. Since the Complaint is fully visited, they can re-examine it, but the system says not to reread fully visited documents. So they shouldn't read it again. Instead, they should check if they missed the defendant in the initial read. But according to the process, after reading, they should have extracted all possible values. So perhaps they missed the defendant's name in the Complaint.\n\nWait, the verification statement says \"I am the elected State Attorney... and the Plaintiff in this case.\" It also mentions \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently issued an Executive Order suspending me from that office.\" So the defendant is likely the Governor and/or the State. But the formal defendant would be \"State of Florida\" or \"Ron DeSantis in his official capacity as Governor\".\n\nIn legal documents, the defendant is often the state or a government official. So the defendant's entry should be \"Defendant: State of Florida\" or \"Defendant: Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida\".\n\nSince the user hasn't extracted that yet, they need to find it. The Complaint's caption (page 1) should list the parties. Let's assume that in the Complaint, the caption says:\n\n\"Andrew H. Warren, Plaintiff, v. State of Florida, Defendant\"\n\nOr something similar. Since the user read the entire Complaint, they should have seen that. So why wasn't it extracted? Maybe the user missed it in their initial extraction. Therefore, they should use get_checklist to see what's currently extracted, but since they already have one value, maybe they need to check if there's more.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 1\", which is correct (only the plaintiff). So the next step is to check if the defendant is in the Complaint. But since the Complaint is fully visited, they can't read it again. Wait, no—they can't reread it, but they should have already processed it. The system says \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\". So if the defendant's name was in the Complaint, it should have been extracted. But it wasn't. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial extraction, and they need to correct it.\n\nWait, the user used append_checklist to add the plaintiff. But the defendant is missing. So they need to find the defendant. Since the Complaint is fully read, they should have the information. Therefore, they need to use get_checklist to see the current state, but the problem is they haven't checked for the defendant. Wait, no—get_checklist would show the current extracted values, which is only the plaintiff. So the next action would be to check if the defendant is in another document.\n\nWait, the defendant is likely the State of Florida, which might be mentioned in the Complaint. Since the Complaint is fully read, and the defendant's name should be there, the user should have extracted it. But they didn't. So perhaps they need to re-examine the Complaint's text. But the system says not to reread fully visited documents. So the correct action is to use get_checklist to confirm the current state, but since they already know the current state, maybe they should proceed to check other documents for additional parties. Wait, but the defendant is probably in the Complaint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendant is listed in another document, like the Docket or the Defendant's Motion. For example, the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss might list the defendant as \"State of Florida\".\n\nSo, the next step is to check other documents that might have the defendant's name. The Docket document (31,111 tokens) is unvisited. The Docket might list the parties. In court dockets, the parties are usually listed in the caption.\n\nSo the best action is to read the Docket document, starting from the beginning, to find the parties. Since the Docket is unvisited, they should use read_document on Docket, tokens 0-10000 (since it's 31k tokens, max 10k per read).\n\nBut wait, the system says to use search_document_regex if the target is patternable. The parties are likely listed in a standard way, like \"Plaintiff: ...\" and \"Defendant: ...\", so maybe a regex search would be better. For example, search for \"Plaintiff:|Defendant:\".\n\nBut the user is to choose one action. The current checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", and the user needs to find the defendant. Since the Complaint was fully read but the defendant wasn't extracted (assuming it's there), but the user missed it, they need to check another document. Wait, but the defendant should be in the Complaint. So maybe the user needs to re-extract the defendant from the Complaint. But they can't reread it. Therefore, the correct action is to use get_checklist to confirm, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, they should use update_checklist to add the defendant's entry based on the Complaint's content, but since they can't reread, they need to have already processed it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial extraction. The verification statement mentions \"the Plaintiff in this case\" but doesn't explicitly say \"Defendant\". The defendant might be the State of Florida, which is mentioned in the Executive Order (Exhibit 1). So maybe the defendant is in Exhibit 1.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" [Other] - 12,265 tokens - ○ Unvisited. The Executive Order issued by Governor Ron DeSantis suspending Andrew Warren. So the defendant here is Governor DeSantis or the State. The Executive Order might mention the parties.\n\nSo the next logical step is to read Exhibit 1 to see if it lists the parties. Alternatively, check the Docket.\n\nBut the Docket is more likely to have the parties listed in the caption. So the best action is to read the Docket document to find the parties.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be read_document on Docket, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5766, "completion_tokens": 2981, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the parties involved from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already read the Complaint (tokens 0-1431) and found one entry: Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren, elected State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit. That was appended via append_checklist.\n\nNow, they've read the Docket document (tokens 0-10000) and need to check if there are more parties mentioned there. The Docket is partially visited (32% coverage), so maybe there's more info in the unviewed parts.\n\nLooking at the Docket text provided, I see entries like \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\" and \"NOTICE OF APPEARANCE by JEFFREY PAUL DESOUSA on behalf of RON DESANTIS\". So Ron DeSantis is the defendant, and the attorneys like Jeffrey Paul Desousa are appearing for him.\n\nWait, the checklist requires the parties themselves, not the attorneys. So the main parties are Andrew H. Warren (Plaintiff) and Ron DeSantis (Defendant). The Docket mentions \"Ron DeSantis\" as the defendant in the complaint. So there should be a Defendant entry for Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn the Docket, line 1: \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS ( Filing fee $ 402 receipt number AFLNDC-7401384.), filed by ANDREW H WARREN.\" So the defendant is Ron DeSantis.\n\nAlso, in the Complaint, the plaintiff is Andrew H. Warren. So the defendant is Ron DeSantis. The Docket entry clearly states \"against RON DESANTIS\", so that's the defendant.\n\nNow, check if there's any other party. The Docket mentions other notices like \"MOTION to Intervene\" by Scott Huminski, but that's an intervenor, not a main party. The main parties are plaintiff and defendant.\n\nSo the Defendant entry should be \"Defendant: Ron DeSantis\".\n\nThe Docket text provided (up to tokens 0-10000) includes line 1 which mentions Ron DeSantis as the defendant. So the evidence is from the Docket, page 1 (since the Docket starts with line 1).\n\nNeed to make sure the evidence is properly cited. The Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", so the location is \"Docket Entry 1\" or \"Page 1 of Docket\".\n\nWait, the Docket document's text shows entries numbered 1,2,3, etc. So entry 1 is the complaint against Ron DeSantis.\n\nSo the extracted value for Who_are_the_Parties should include:\n\n- Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren (from Complaint, Page 28)\n- Defendant: Ron DeSantis (from Docket Entry 1)\n\nThe previous action already appended the Plaintiff entry. Now, the Docket entry has the Defendant. So need to append the Defendant entry.\n\nCheck if there are other parties. The Docket mentions \"Ron DeSantis\" multiple times as the defendant. No other main parties mentioned. The attorneys are representatives, not parties.\n\nSo the next step is to append the Defendant value from the Docket. Since the Docket was read up to tokens 0-10000, and the relevant part is in the first entry, which is within the viewed tokens.\n\nTherefore, the action should be append_checklist with the new Defendant entry.\n\nEvidence for Defendant: from Docket Entry 1, \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\".\n\nSo the evidence text is \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", source_document is Docket, location is \"Docket Entry 1\".\n\nNeed to format as per the requirements: value should be \"Defendant: Ron DeSantis\".\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles... value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value is \"Defendant: Ron DeSantis\", and the evidence is the snippet from the Docket.\n\nIn the Docket, the entry says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", so the description is \"Ron DeSantis\" as the defendant.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Defendant: Ron DeSantis\", evidence text is \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", source_document \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 1\".\n\nNow, check if the Docket has been fully read. The Docket was read up to tokens 0-10000, and the relevant entry (Entry 1) is at the start, so it's within the viewed tokens.

But the checklist only has one key, \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which already has two values. The next step is to confirm if there are any other parties.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", so Defendant is Ron DeSantis. The Complaint's verification statement identifies Andrew H. Warren as Plaintiff. Are there any other parties mentioned in the documents? For example, in the Docket entries, there are mentions of other attorneys or entities, but those are not parties to the case—they're attorneys or amici curiae.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n- Entry 1: Complaint filed by Andrew H. Warren against Ron DeSantis.\n- Entry 3: Motion for Preliminary Injunction by Andrew H. Warren.\n- Entry 8: Notice of Appearance by Jeffrey Paul Desousa on behalf of Ron DeSantis.\n- Entries 16-17: Notices of Appearance by Morris Weinberg and Sara Lawson on behalf of Legal Scholars (amicus, not parties).\n- Entries 18-21: Motions for Pro Hac Vice by various attorneys for Andrew H. Warren.\n- Entry 31: Order denying motions to intervene by Scott Huminski.\n- Entry 42: Notice of Appearance by David Matthew Costello on behalf of Ron DeSantis.\n- Entry 57-58: Notices of Appearance by Jeffrey Michael Aaron and George Ty Levesque on behalf of Ron DeSantis.\n\nAll these attorneys are representing the parties (Plaintiff Warren and Defendant DeSantis), but they are not parties themselves. The parties are only Andrew H. Warren (Plaintiff) and Ron DeSantis (Defendant).\n\nThe other documents like the Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, etc., probably don't add new parties. The checklist item is about the parties involved, not their attorneys. So the only two entries are already extracted.\n\nThe system shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", so all applicable values are covered. There are no other parties mentioned. The Not Applicable count is 0, and no empty keys. So the checklist is complete.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop. The user's instruction says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" has two values, so it's complete.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All parties (Plaintiff: Andrew H.

The user wants me to extract all parties involved from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", which should list each party as either Plaintiff or Defendant with their descriptions.\n\nLooking at the current status, the system has already extracted two values: Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren from the Complaint (Page 28) and Defendant: Ron DeSantis from the Docket Entry 1. The documents checked so far are Complaint (fully visited) and Docket (partially visited up to 10,000 tokens). The Docket document has more entries beyond token 10,000, but the current extraction only used the first entry.\n\nWait, the Docket document's entry 1 mentions \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", so that's the Defendant. But are there any other parties listed in the Docket beyond the first entry? The Docket entries go up to 72, but the user only read up to 10,000 tokens. The Docket document is 31,111 tokens, so there's more to read. However, the previous steps already found both parties. Let me check the other documents.\n\nThe other documents like the Initial Scheduling Order, Order/Opinion, etc., are unvisited. But the checklist is about parties, which are typically in the Complaint and Docket. The Complaint already has the Plaintiff, and the Docket has the Defendant. The other documents are motions, orders, etc., which might mention other parties like attorneys or amici curiae, but the checklist specifies \"parties\" (plaintiff and defendant), not attorneys or intervenors.\n\nWait, the requirements say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The checklist item is defined as \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So it's about the main parties, not the attorneys. The Complaint says \"Plaintiff: Andrew H. Warren\", and the Docket entry says \"COMPLAINT against RON DESANTIS\", so Defendant: Ron DeSantis. \n\nThe other documents mention attorneys like \"JEFFREY PAUL DESOUSA on behalf of RON DESANTIS\", but those are attorneys, not parties. Similarly, amici curiae (like Legal Scholars) are not parties. So the only two parties are Andrew H. Warren (Plaintiff) and Ron DeSantis (Defendant). \n\nThe current status shows 2 values extracted, and the system tried to stop at step 6. Then step 7 ran get_checklist, which shows 1 key filled with 2 values. The user's task is to confirm if all parties are extracted. Since the main parties are already covered, and other entries are not parties, there's nothing else to extract. The Docket's remaining tokens beyond 10,000 might not contain additional party information. The document catalog shows Docket is partially visited, but the evidence for Defendant is already from the first entry. There's no indication that other entries in the Docket would add new parties. For example, entries 8, 9, etc., mention attorneys or other motions, but not new parties.\n\nSo the checklist is complete. The system should stop. The previous stop attempt was step 6, but the system requires a second stop to confirm. The current status shows all keys are filled, so the next action should be to stop again.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All parties (Plaintiff: Andrew H.
