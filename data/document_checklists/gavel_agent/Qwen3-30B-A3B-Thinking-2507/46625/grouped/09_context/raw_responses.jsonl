The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown. Since the document catalog is unknown (it's showing 0 documents), the first step should be to call list_documents to find out what documents are available.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So definitely, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action is to list the documents first. I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents exist.

The user needs to extract the Factual_Basis_of_Case from legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and there are 11 unvisited documents. First, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain the factual basis. The Complaint is usually where the facts are laid out, so the Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is a good starting point. It's a Complaint, which typically details the plaintiff's claims and the facts supporting them.\n\nThe document is 16,778 tokens, but I can only read up to 10,000 tokens at a time. So I'll start by reading the first 10,000 tokens. The next step is to call read_document with the document name and the token range from 0 to 10000. That should give me the initial part of the Complaint where the factual basis is likely described. After that, I'll analyze the text to find the relevant facts and evidence mentioned, then use append_checklist to add those entries with proper evidence. But for now, the first action is to read the document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3667, "completion_tokens": 295, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the checklist item \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" from the legal documents provided. The current status shows that this key is empty, and I've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Class Action Complaint.\n\nLooking at the document content, the complaint is quite detailed. The key sections that might contain factual basis include the \"INTRODUCTION\" (paragraphs 1-9), \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" (starting at paragraph 25), and the specific subsections about each plaintiff's programs (like CCYJ, Stop AAPI Hate, etc.). \n\nThe checklist definition specifies that factual basis should include: details of relevant events (what, when, where, who), evidence, and background. The complaint has a lot of this. For example, paragraph 1 describes the termination of grants in April 2025. Paragraphs 2-3 explain the abrupt termination without notice, the amount of funding ($820 million), and the types of programs affected. \n\nI should look for specific evidence snippets that match the definition. Let me scan the text again. In paragraph 4, it details what the plaintiffs do: \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations that were awarded federal grant funding. They work to train and assist law enforcement...\" That's part of the factual basis. Paragraphs 25-38 describe each plaintiff's specific grants and programs, which are key facts. \n\nThe termination events are clearly stated: \"On April 4, 2025, Plaintiff Vera Institute... received an email... immediately terminating five grants\" (para 42), and similar for others on April 22 (para 43). The \"boilerplate explanation\" in paragraph 44 is also part of the factual basis—OJP's stated reason for termination. \n\nThe harm caused by termination is described in paragraphs 51-72, like \"CCYJ has had to end a project... serving up to 200 youth annually\" (para 52). These are factual details about the impact. \n\nI need to extract distinct values. Each paragraph with specific facts should be a separate entry. For example:\n- The April 2025 termination of over 370 grants ($820M) without notice (para 1-3)\n- Specific plaintiff programs (CCYJ's LINC program, Stop AAPI Hate's community approaches, etc.)\n- The boilerplate termination reason (para 44)\n- The immediate harm (e.g., layoffs, service cutoffs)\n\nI'll compile verbatim snippets with evidence. The complaint's text is rich, so I'll pull the most relevant parts. For instance, para 1: \"In April 2025, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs abruptly and summarily terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding.\" That's a clear factual basis entry.\n\nAnother one: para 26 lists the plaintiffs' grant programs addressing violence prevention, etc. The specific grant numbers (like 15PBJA-22-GG-04749-MUMU) are evidence of the factual basis.\n\nI should structure each extracted entry with:\n- Value: concise summary of the fact\n- Evidence: the exact quote from the document\n- Source: \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- Location: page number and paragraph\n\nWait, the document shows page numbers (e.g., Page 1, Page 2), so I'll use those. For example, the April 2025 termination is on Page 2 (para 1), but the actual quote is on Page 3? Wait, the text says \"Case 1:25-cv-01643 Document 1 Filed 05/21/25 Page 3\" for para 1. Need to be precise.\n\nLet me map:\n- Para 1 (Page 3): \"In April 2025, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs abruptly and summarily terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding.\"\n- Para 26 (Page 7): \"OJP’s granted various awards to each of the Plaintiffs to fund Plaintiffs’ work to create safer communities. Plaintiffs’ grant programs address a broad swath of community violence intervention and prevention projects...\"\n- Para 44 (Page 14): The boilerplate termination explanation.\n- Para 52 (Page 16): CCYJ's specific impact (ending services for 200 youth).\n\nEach of these is a distinct factual basis element. I'll create separate entries for each.\n\nNow, the next action: since I've read the document and found these facts, I should use `append_checklist` to add them. I can batch multiple entries for the same key (Factual_Basis_of_Case). \n\nI need to ensure each entry has evidence with text, source, and location. For example:\n- Text: \"In April 2025, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs abruptly and summarily terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding.\"\n- Source: \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"\n- Location: \"Page 3, Paragraph 1\"\n\nRepeat for others. The checklist allows multiple values per key, so I'll include all relevant ones from the read portion.\n\nNo need for `get_checklist` yet since I have fresh evidence to append. Also, the key isn't Not Applicable—there's plenty of content. So `append_checklist` is the right move.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\",\n
