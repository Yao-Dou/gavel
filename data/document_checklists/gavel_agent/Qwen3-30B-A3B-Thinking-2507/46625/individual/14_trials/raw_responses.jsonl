The user is trying to extract trial information from legal documents, but the current status shows there are 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Trials\" is empty, and all the documents are unknown.\n\nHmm, the first step here is to figure out what documents exist. Since the system says \"No documents discovered yet,\" I need to call list_documents to get the catalog. Without knowing the available documents, I can't proceed to read or search them. The instructions say that if the document catalog is unknown, the first action should be to list_documents. So the correct move here is to use that function. I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents are present. Let me check the decision policy again: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call list_documents.\" Yep, that's exactly the case here. So the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3090, "completion_tokens": 202, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all trial information from the provided documents. First, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain trial-related details.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's a \"Docket\" which typically lists court proceedings, including trial dates and statuses. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have trial outcomes, and the various motions (like Preliminary Injunction, Class Certification) could mention trial schedules. But the Docket is usually the primary source for trial scheduling.\n\nThe user has 11 documents, all unvisited. Since the Docket is a standard document for tracking court events, it's the best place to start. I should read the entire Docket first because it's only 7,368 tokens, which is under the 10k limit. No need for regex here since the Docket is a structured document where trial info is likely listed in chronological order.\n\nI'll use read_document on the Docket. Start from token 0 to the end (7368 tokens). This should give me the trial details without needing to search. After reading, I'll check the text for any trial mentions, like \"trial scheduled,\" \"set for trial,\" or dates. Then I'll append those to the checklist with proper evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Trials\" with info on scheduling, proceedings, outcomes. The Docket should have entries like \"Trial set for [date]\" or \"Trial held on [date].\" So reading the Docket first makes sense. No need to search regex here since the Docket is a single document and the info is probably in the main text.\n\nMake sure not to read other documents yet. Focus on the Docket first. Once I get the text, I can extract the trial info and append it. If the Docket doesn't have it, then check other documents like the Memorandum Opinion or motions. But starting with the Docket is the logical first step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7368}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7368}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3532, "completion_tokens": 452, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Trials\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that the \"Trials\" key is empty, and there are 11 documents available. The Docket document has already been fully read (tokens 0-7368), but the other documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain trial information. The Docket was read, but the main trial details might be in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" (Order/Opinion), the \"Order\" document, or the \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" since there's a hearing mentioned in the Docket on June 26th.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 40 mentions a \"Status Conference\" on June 26th, and the transcript (entry 46) is about the motion hearing. The Memorandum Opinion (entry 47) and Order (entry 48) would have the court's ruling on the motions, which could include trial-related info. The \"Trials\" checklist item is about scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nThe Docket already has some trial-related events: the hearing on June 26, 2025, and the subsequent order. So the key points from the Docket are:\n\n- June 26, 2025: Motions Hearing (entry 40)\n- July 7, 2025: Memorandum Opinion and Order (entries 47, 48)\n- July 10, 2025: Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (entries 51, 52)\n- July 21, 2025: Order granting in part the emergency motion (entry 57)\n\nBut the Docket is already fully visited, so I can't read it again. The next step is to extract the trial information from the Docket's already-read content. Wait, but the Docket was read in step 2, and the user's recent actions show that they read the Docket (tokens 0-7368). Now, I need to process that text to find the \"Trials\" entries.\n\nLooking at the Docket content provided in the snapshot, the relevant parts are:\n\n- Entry 40: June 26, 2025 hearing on motions (certify class, preliminary injunction, motion to dismiss). Court took under advisement.\n- Entry 46: Transcript of the hearing on June 26.\n- Entry 47: Memorandum Opinion dated July 7, 2025.\n- Entry 48: Order dated July 7, 2025, denying preliminary injunction, granting motion to dismiss, and denying class certification as moot.\n- Entry 57: Order on Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal, dated July 21, 2025.\n\nThe \"Trials\" checklist item needs to capture all trial-related info. The June 26 hearing is a key proceeding. The outcome is in the July 7 order. The emergency motion hearing might be part of the trial proceedings.\n\nSo, from the Docket, the extracted values for \"Trials\" should include:\n\n1. The hearing on June 26, 2025, regarding motions for class certification, preliminary injunction, and dismissal. The court took the matters under advisement.\n2. The ruling on July 7, 2025, denying the preliminary injunction and class certification, and granting the motion to dismiss.\n3. The subsequent emergency motion for injunction pending appeal, with the order on July 21.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist says \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The Docket mentions a \"Motions Hearing\" on June 26, not a trial. However, the term \"trial\" might be used loosely here, or the motions hearing is part of the trial process. Since the case is about a class action, the hearing on the motions would be part of the trial proceedings.\n\nSo, the key entries to extract are:\n\n- Hearing date: June 26, 2025, at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10 (from entry 29's minute order)\n- Outcome: Order dated July 7, 2025, denying preliminary injunction, granting motion to dismiss, and denying class certification as moot (from entry 48)\n- Emergency motion hearing: The order on July 21, 2025, regarding the injunction pending appeal (entry 57)\n\nBut the Docket has already been read, so I need to use the text from the Docket to extract these. The next step is to call `append_checklist` to add these entries with evidence.\n\nWait, the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", meaning no values have been extracted yet. Even though the Docket was read in step 2, the assistant hasn't processed it to extract the checklist items. So the next action should be to append the checklist entries based on the Docket text.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n\n- Entry 29: Minute Order from 5/29/2025 sets the hearing for June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10.\n- Entry 40: Minute Entry for proceedings on June 26, 2025, stating the court heard arguments on the motions and took them under advisement.\n- Entry 47 and 48: The opinion and order on July 7, 2025.\n- Entry 57: The order on July 21, 2025.\n\nSo, the evidence for \"Trials\" should include these entries. Each entry needs to be a separate extracted value with evidence.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: \"Hearing on June 26, 2025, at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10 for motions regarding class certification, preliminary injunction, and dismissal\"\n- Evidence: Docket entry 29 (Minute Order) and entry 40 (Minute Entry)\n\nWait, but the evidence needs to be verbatim text. Let's check the Docket text:\n\nEntry 29 (from the Docket snapshot):\n\"MINUTE ORDER. The schedule for further proceedings on Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and class certification shall be as follows: (1) Defendants' combined motion to dismiss and opposition to Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and class certification shall be filed by June 9, 2025; (2) Plaintiffs' replies in support of their motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss shall be filed by June 16, 2025; (3) Defendants' reply in support of their motion to dismiss shall be filed by June 23, 2025; and (4) the parties shall appear for a hearing on the motions on June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10. Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 5/29/2025. (lcapm2)\"\n\nEntry 40:\n\"Minute Entry for proceedings held before Judge Amit P. Mehta: Motions Hearing held on 6/26/2025. Court heard arguments on the Plaintiffs' Motions 2 to Certify Class and 3 for Preliminary Injunction, and the Defendant's 4 Motion to Dismiss and Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Court took the matters under advisement. (Court Reporter: Willima Zaremba). (zakb) (zakb)\"\n\nEntry 48:\n\"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot. See the attached Order for additional details. Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/7/2025. (lcapm1) (Entered: 07/07/2025)\"\n\nEntry 57:\n\"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. The parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025, which updates the court on the status of appellate proceedings, including whether the court of appeals has granted emergency relief or expedited review. The parties shall advise whether the injunction should be extended. See the attached Order for additional details. Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025. (lcapm1) (Entered: 07/21/2025)\"\n\nSo, the \"Trials\" checklist should have multiple entries:\n\n1. Hearing scheduled for June 26, 2025 (from entry 29)\n2. Hearing held on June 26, 2025 (from entry 40)\n3. Ruling on July 7, 2025 (from entry 48)\n4. Emergency motion order on July 21, 2025 (from entry 57)\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Trials\", which might refer to the main trial, but in this case, it's a motions hearing. However, the user's checklist says \"including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So all these are relevant.\n\nNow, to extract them as separate entries. Each entry needs evidence with text, source document, and location.\n\nThe source document for all these is the Docket (since they're in the Docket entries). The location can be the event number (e.g., entry 29, 40, 48, 57).\n\nWait, the Docket document's name is \"Docket\" as per the available documents. So for each evidence, source_document is \"Docket\", location is the event number (like \"Event 29\" or \"Docket Entry 29\").\n\nBut the exact location in the document: the Docket is a list of entries, each with a number. So for entry 29, location is \"Docket Entry 29\".\n\nNow, the extracted values:\n\n- For the hearing date: \"Hearing scheduled for June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10 (Event 29)\"\n- For the hearing held: \"Motions Hearing held on June 26, 2025 (Event 40)\"\n- For the ruling: \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction denied, Motion to Dismiss granted, Class Certification denied as moot (Event 48)\"\n- For the emergency order: \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal granted in part, denying in part (Event 57)\"\n\nBut the user's requirement is to extract \"EVERY distinct value\", so each of these is a distinct value.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Trials\", and the values are the trial-related information. So each of these events is a separate value.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these to the checklist using `append_checklist`.\n\nBut the Docket has already been read, so the assistant needs to process that text and append the entries.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited, and the text is available, the next step is to call `append_checklist` with the extracted values.\n\nSo, the JSON for the tool call should be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Trials\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Hearing scheduled for June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the parties shall appear for a hearing on the motions on June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Event 29\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Motions Hearing held on June 26, 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Motions Hearing held on 6/26/2025.

The text snippets above are from the Docket entries.\n\nCheck the exact text in the snapshot:\n\nFor Event 29 (Docket entry 29):\n\"the parties shall appear for a hearing on the motions on June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10.\"\n\nFor Event 40:\n\"Motions Hearing held on 6/26/2025. Court heard arguments on the Plaintiffs' Motions 2 to Certify Class and 3 for Preliminary Injunction, and the Defendant's 4 Motion to Dismiss and Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nFor Event 48:\n\"Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\"\n\nFor Event 57:\n\"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\"\n\nSo the evidence texts are correctly quoted.\n\nNow, the next action should be to append these four entries to the \"Trials\" key.\n\nThe current status shows \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so after appending, the key will be filled.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is `append_checklist` with the above patch.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Trials\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Hearing scheduled for June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"the parties shall appear for a hearing on the motions on June 26, 2025 at 2:00 PM in Courtroom 10.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Event 29\"}]}, {\"value\": \"Motions Hearing held on June 26, 2025\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Motions Hearing held on 6/26/2025.

The user is asking to extract all checklist items related to \"Trials\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that 4 values have already been extracted from the Docket document, which is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The Docket has 7,368 tokens, and all of it has been read.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is already fully visited, so there's no need to read it again. The other documents are all unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the checklist item is \"Trials\", which likely refers to trial-related events like hearings, motions, and rulings. The Docket already provided the key trial-related information: the hearing date, the hearing itself, the denial of motions, and the emergency motion outcome.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are any other documents that might contain additional trial information. However, the checklist definition says \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The Docket entries cover all these aspects. The other documents (like Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc.) might contain more details, but the Docket is the primary source for event listings. Since the Docket has already been fully read and all relevant trial info extracted, the other documents probably don't add new trial-related data.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say to extract EVERY distinct value found in any document. The Docket has four values. Are there any other trial-related events in the other documents? Let's think. The Complaint is the initial filing, which doesn't mention a trial. The Memorandum Opinion (Event 47) and Order (Event 48) are the court's decisions, but the Docket already captured those outcomes. The Amicus Briefs and Motions might reference the trial but not add new scheduling or proceedings. The Emergency Motion (Event 51) and related events are part of the appellate process, but the Docket already has the hearing on June 26 and the subsequent orders. The \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (Event 51) is part of the appellate process, but the trial (the hearing) was already covered in Event 29 and 40.\n\nSo, the Docket's Event 29 mentions the hearing date, Event 40 is the hearing itself, Event 48 is the ruling, and Event 57 is the emergency motion outcome. The other documents might have more details, but the checklist item is about the trial information, which has been covered. The Docket is the main source for such event listings, and since it's fully visited, there's no need to read other documents for this checklist item.\n\nThe system's policy says not to reread fully visited documents.

Since there's only one key and it's filled, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", so all keys are filled.

The checklist has 1 key (Trials) with 4 values, and it's marked as filled.\n\nThe user's task is to make sure all applicable checklist items are extracted. The key here is Trials, and they have four entries from the Docket. The problem is whether there are more trial-related information in the other documents. But the Docket is a comprehensive record of all events, including the hearing on June 26, 2025, the court's opinion, and the subsequent motions. The other documents like the Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc., might contain details about the trial, but the Docket already captured the scheduling, proceedings, and outcomes.

But the Docket is the master list of events, so other documents might reference the trial but not add new details.

The Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (Event 51) is about an appeal, not the original trial. The hearing date (Event 29) and the hearing itself (Event 40) are already covered.\n\nThe system's automatic review says \"No additional trial information is expected in unvisited documents as the Docket comprehensively covers scheduling, proceedings, and outcomes.\" So the four values are all that's needed.
