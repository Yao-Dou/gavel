The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there's no documents listed, I need to use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nI shouldn't try to read or search documents because there are none to read. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't present here.

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and it's currently empty. The task is to find every distinct date related to decrees, including entry dates, amendments, suspensions, etc., formatted as '[date]: [event]'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The main documents that would have decree dates are probably the Orders, Memorandum Opinions, and maybe the Docket. The Complaint and other motions might not have the decree dates themselves but could reference them.\n\nLooking at the available documents:\n- There's a \"Docket\" document, which often lists court entries, including when orders were issued.\n- \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"Order\" documents might contain the actual decree dates.\n- The other documents are motions, briefs, etc., which might mention dates but not necessarily the decree dates themselves.\n\nThe Docket is a good starting point because dockets typically list all court actions with dates. For example, the entry date of a decree would be on the docket. The \"Order\" document is also likely to have the decree date. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have the date the opinion was issued, which could be the decree date.\n\nThe user has 11 documents, all unvisited. Since the Docket is a standard place to find entry dates, I should start there. The Docket is 7,368 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole document in one go with read_document.\n\nWait, the Docket is listed as \"Docket [Docket] - 7,368 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". So, reading the entire Docket makes sense here. The Docket should have entries like \"Order entered on [date]\" or \"Decree filed on [date]\". That's where the decree dates would be listed.\n\nI should use read_document on the Docket, starting at token 0 to end of document (7368). That way, I can scan the entire docket for any mention of decree dates. The other documents might have related info, but the Docket is the most direct source for entry dates.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Docket document, from start_token 0 to end_token 7368.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7368}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7368}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3649, "completion_tokens": 538, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", which includes entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all 11 documents are listed, but only the Docket has been fully read (tokens 0-7368). The Docket entry from Step 2 shows various events. Let me scan through the Docket entries for any dates related to decrees.\n\nIn the Docket, I see entries like:\n- Entry 47: \"MEMORANDUM OPINION\" signed on 7/7/2025.\n- Entry 48: \"ORDER\" signed on 7/7/2025.\n- Entry 57: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part...\" signed on 7/21/2025.\n\nWait, the requirement says to include entry dates of court orders that are decrees. Entry 48 is an \"ORDER\" that denies the motion and grants the dismissal. The description says \"See the attached Order for additional details.\" So the entry date here is 7/7/2025. Similarly, Entry 57 is another order signed on 7/21/2025.\n\nBut the checklist specifies \"decree-related dates\" including entry dates of orders. So the order entries in the Docket are relevant. The Docket entries have \"Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on [date]\".\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n\n- Entry 48: \"ORDER... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/7/2025.\"\n- Entry 57: \"ORDER... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025.\"\n\nThese are the entry dates for the orders. The checklist requires each date as a separate value with the decree event.\n\nAlso, check if there are other entries. Entry 47 is a Memorandum Opinion, which is not an order, so it's not a decree. The order entries (48 and 57) are the key ones.\n\nSo the extracted dates should be:\n- 2025-07-07: Entry of Order (denying preliminary injunction, granting dismissal)\n- 2025-07-21: Entry of Order (granting in part, denying in part the emergency motion)\n\nWait, the date format in the Docket is MM/DD/YYYY. So 7/7/2025 is July 7, 2025. The requirement says to format as [date]: [decree event]. So for entry 48, the event is \"Order denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and granting Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" based on the description. Similarly, entry 57's event is \"Order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\".\n\nBut the user's requirement says to include the event in the value. So each entry should be like \"2025-07-07: Order denying preliminary injunction and granting dismissal\".\n\nWait, the Docket entry 48 says: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\"\n\nSo the decree event is the denial of the motion and granting of the dismissal. So the value would be \"2025-07-07: Order denying preliminary injunction and granting dismissal\".\n\nSimilarly, entry 57: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\"\n\nSo the value is \"2025-07-21: Order granting in part and denying in part Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\".\n\nNow, the Docket has been fully read (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again. The next step is to append these dates to the checklist.\n\nCheck if there are any other documents that might have decree dates. The other documents are unvisited (○ Unvisited), but the Docket already contains the order dates. The other documents like the Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc., might not have the entry dates since the Docket is where the court entries are logged. The Docket is the official record of court events, so the dates in the Docket entries (like 48 and 57) are the decree dates.\n\nSo the extracted values are the two dates from the Docket. Now, need to create evidence entries for each.\n\nFor each date, evidence should include the verbatim text, source document (Docket), and location (entry number, e.g., \"Entry 48\" or \"Docket Entry 48\").\n\nSo for the first date:\n- Value: \"2025-07-07: Order denying preliminary injunction and granting dismissal\"\n- Evidence text: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot. Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/7/2025.\"\n- Source: Docket\n- Location: Docket Entry 48\n\nWait, the Docket entries are numbered, so Entry 48 is the specific location.\n\nSimilarly, for the second date:\n- Value: \"2025-07-21: Order granting in part and denying in part Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\"\n- Evidence text: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. The parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025.\"\n- Source: Docket\n- Location: Docket Entry 57\n\nNow, check if these are the only ones. The Docket has other entries, but they don't mention orders related to decrees. For example, entry 47 is a Memorandum Opinion, not an order. The orders are entries 48 and 57.\n\nSo the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" should have these two entries. Since the Docket has been fully read, and these are the only decree dates found, the next action is to append these to the checklist.\n\nThe user's step 3 had a parsing error, but that's resolved now. The current action should be to append the checklist entries using append_checklist with the two values.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"2025-07-07: Order denying preliminary injunction and granting dismissal\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"ORDER.

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, which includes entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments.\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already processed the Docket document (tokens 0-7368) and found two dates: 2025-05-07 and 2025-07-21. The Docket is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, there are 10 unvisited documents. The next step is to check if any of these documents might contain additional decree dates. The key is to find any orders, memoranda opinions, or other court documents that mention decree dates.\n\nThe current extracted values are from Docket entries 48 and 57. Entry 48 is the Order dated 2025-07-07, and entry 57 is the Order dated 2025-07-21. But maybe other documents like the Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) or the Emergency Motion might have more dates.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting all distinct values. The Docket has two entries, but perhaps other documents have more. For example, the \"Order\" document (2,241 tokens) might have the actual order text with dates. Similarly, the Memorandum Opinion might reference dates.\n\nBut the user's current state shows that the Docket is fully visited, and other documents are unvisited. Since the Docket is the only one read so far, the next logical step is to read another document that might contain decree-related dates. The most likely candidates are the \"Order\" document (Order/Opinion) and the \"Memorandum Opinion\" (Order/Opinion), as they are court orders.\n\nLooking at the document list, the \"Order\" [Order/Opinion] is 2,241 tokens, which is under 10k, so it's safe to read. Alternatively, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" is 22k tokens, which is over 10k, so we'd have to read a portion of it. But the problem says to read ≤10k tokens per call, so maybe start with the smaller \"Order\" document.\n\nWait, the \"Order\" document is listed as [Order/Opinion] with 2,241 tokens. That's small enough to read entirely. Let's check if it's the actual order that was mentioned in the Docket. The Docket entry 48 refers to \"ORDER\" signed on 7/7/2025. The document named \"Order\" might be the full text of that order, which would have the date. But the Docket entry already captured the date as 2025-07-07. However, maybe the actual order document has more dates, like modification dates or other related dates.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract all decree dates, including entry dates, modifications, etc. The Docket's entry 48 mentions the order denying the injunction, but the actual \"Order\" document might have the date of the order itself, which is already captured. But maybe there's another order in another document.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (51) and the \"Order granting in part...\" (57) might have dates. But the Docket entry 57 already has the date 2025-07-21.\n\nWait, the user's recent action already appended two dates from the Docket. The next step is to check if other documents have more dates. The \"Order\" document (2,241 tokens) is a candidate. Let's read that document to see if it contains any decree dates not already captured.\n\nThe \"Order\" document is named [Order/Opinion], which is likely the actual order from Docket entry 48. But since the Docket already has the date, maybe the document itself doesn't add new dates. However, the checklist requires all distinct values. If the order document has the same date, it's redundant. But maybe there's another date in the document, like a modification date.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" (Order/Opinion) might have dates related to the order. Wait, the Memorandum Opinion (47) is the opinion that precedes the Order (48). The date of the Memorandum Opinion is 7/7/2025, same as the Order. So maybe the Opinion document has the date, but it's the same as the Docket entry.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 47 is the Memorandum Opinion dated 7/7/25, and 48 is the Order dated 7/7/25. So the actual order date is already captured. The question is whether other documents have additional decree dates.\n\nLooking at the list of documents, the \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (51) might have dates related to the motion, but the order granting it is 7/21/25. The Docket entry 57 already has that date.\n\nAnother document is \"Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal\" (114,973 tokens). But that's a motion, not a decree. The decree dates would be in the court's orders, not the motions.\n\nThe \"Class Action Complaint\" might have dates, but complaints are initial filings, not decrees. The checklist specifies decree dates, so complaints wouldn't count.\n\nThe \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" would have dates related to the motion, not decrees.\n\nSo perhaps the only decree dates are the two already found. But to be thorough, we should check the \"Order\" document (2,241 tokens) to confirm. Since it's a small document, reading it entirely is efficient.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the \"Order\" document (tokens 0-2241) to see if it contains any decree dates not already extracted. If it does, append them. If not, move on.\n\nThe document name is \"Order\" [Order/Opinion], so the read_document call should be for that document, start_token 0, end_token 2241.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2241}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2241}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11527, "completion_tokens": 1402, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and we need to find every distinct date related to decrees, including entry dates, modifications, suspensions, etc.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are two values already extracted from the Docket document. The first one is \"2025-05-21\" from the complaint filing, but wait, no—the user's Step 4 shows that the extracted values are from Docket entries 48 and 57. Entry 48 is the Order dated 2025-07-07, and entry 57 is the Order dated 2025-07-21. So those are the two dates they've already got.\n\nNow, the next step is to check if there are more decree dates in the remaining unvisited documents. The available documents list shows that several documents are unvisited, like the Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, various briefs, etc. The user has already read the Docket and Order documents, which are fully visited. The Order document they read (tokens 0-2241) was the one from July 21, 2025, which is the same as the Docket entry 57. So they have that date covered.\n\nBut the Memorandum Opinion (Document 47) is unvisited. The Docket entry 47 says \"MEMORANDUM OPINION... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/7/2025.\" So the date here is 2025-07-07, which is the same as the Order date (entry 48). But the Memorandum Opinion itself might have more details. However, the checklist requires decree dates, which include the entry dates of the orders. Since the Memorandum Opinion is the opinion supporting the order, the decree date would be the date of the Order (entry 48), not the opinion. But maybe the opinion has the date, so it's redundant. However, the user needs to check if there are other decree dates in other documents.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates, suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates.\" So the main decree dates are the ones when the court issues orders related to decrees. The Order dated 2025-07-07 and 2025-07-21 are already captured.\n\nBut let's look at the other documents. The Complaint (Document 1) is the initial filing, but that's not a decree. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (entry 3) and others are motions, not decrees. The Memorandum Opinion (entry 47) is dated 7/7/2025, but the decree date is the Order (48), which is the same date. So maybe the Memorandum Opinion doesn't add a new date.\n\nThe Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (entry 51) is a motion, and the Order granting part of it (entry 57) is already captured. The Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (the last document in the list) is a motion, not a decree.\n\nWait, the user needs to check if there are any other orders or decrees in the unvisited documents. The documents like the Memorandum Opinion, the Amicus Briefs, etc., might not contain decree dates. The main decree dates would be in the Orders and Memorandum Opinions.\n\nBut the Memorandum Opinion (Document 47) is unvisited. The Docket entry 47 says it's signed on 7/7/2025, which is the same as the Order. So reading the Memorandum Opinion might confirm the date, but it's the same as what's already extracted. So no new date there.\n\nThe other unvisited documents: the Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, etc., are pre-decree. The only decrees are the Orders from the court, which are already covered in Docket entries 48 and 57.\n\nWait, but the user has two entries: 2025-07-07 (Order) and 2025-07-21 (Order). Are there any other Orders? Let's check the Docket entries again. The Docket has entries up to 57, and the last one is 57 on 7/21. The next document might be the Order document they read, which is entry 57, dated 7/21. So all the decree dates are covered.\n\nWait, but the user might have missed something. Let's look at the Docket entries again. Entry 48 is the Order dated 7/7, and entry 57 is the Order dated 7/21. Are there any other orders? For example, entry 11 is an ERRATA, which isn't a decree. Entry 29 is a stipulation, but it's not a decree. The only orders that are decrees (final orders) are 48 and 57.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion (entry 47) is dated 7/7, but the decree is in the Order (48), so the date is the same. So no new date there.\n\nThe other unvisited documents like the Complaint (entry 1) is the initial filing, not a decree. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction (entry 3) is a motion, not a decree. So the only decree dates are 7/7 and 7/21.\n\nBut wait, the user's current extracted values are:\n\n- 2025-07-07: Order denying preliminary injunction and granting dismissal\n- 2025-07-21: Order granting in part and denying in part Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\n\nThese are both valid decree dates. The question is, are there any others?\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, the MINUTE ORDERS (like entry 13, 29, etc.) are not decrees; they're scheduling orders. The only final decrees are the ones that grant or deny motions, like 48 and 57.\n\nSo, the two dates already extracted are the only ones. The user has already read the Docket (which lists all the orders) and the Order document (which confirms the date). The other documents are briefs or motions, which don't contain decree dates.\n\nTherefore, there are no more decree dates to extract. The checklist item Dates_of_All_Decrees should be complete with two entries.\n\nWait, but the user needs to confirm that there are no other decree dates. Let's check if the Memorandum Opinion (Document 47) has any other dates. The Memorandum Opinion's date is 7/7/2025, but that's the same as the Order. So no new date.\n\nThe other unvisited documents like the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (entry 51) is a motion, and the Order on it (57) is already covered.\n\nSo, the current extraction is complete. The user should stop now.\n\nBut the system requires that they verify with get_checklist before stopping. Wait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the one key is filled. The user has two values for Dates_of_All_Decrees. The checklist is complete. So they can stop.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to stop only when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with two values, so it's complete. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure that there are no more documents to check. The available documents list shows that some are unvisited, but those documents (like the Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc.) don't contain decree dates.

The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and they need to find all distinct dates related to decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted two dates from the Docket (2025-07-07 and 2025-07-21). The Order document they read in Step 5 confirmed those dates. The system says they've checked the Docket and Order as fully visited, and the other documents are unvisited. But the user's previous step (Step 6) tried to stop, but the system says it's stop attempt 1/2 and they need to confirm.\n\nWait, the available documents list shows other files like Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc., as unvisited. But the user's task is to extract decree dates. Decree dates would typically be in court orders, not in complaints or motions. The Docket and Order are where the actual court orders (decrees) would be listed. The Order document they read (Step 5) has the July 21, 2025 date, and the Docket had the July 7 date.\n\nThe system's latest status says all decree dates are extracted. The checklist has 1 key, which is filled with 2 values. The other documents (Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc.) are not likely to contain decree dates because they're motions, briefs, or complaints, not court orders. For example, the Complaint would be the initial filing, not a decree. The Memorandum Opinion is the court's reasoning, but the decree date would be in the Order document. The Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal is a motion, not the decree itself.\n\nThe user's step 6 tried to stop, but the system says it's the first stop attempt. The system's automatic checklist review (Step 7) shows the key is fully populated. The user needs to confirm that no other documents contain decree dates. Since the other documents are unvisited, but they're not the right type (e.g., motions, complaints), there's no need to read them. The decree dates are already found in the Docket and Order.\n\nThe Not Applicable section isn't needed here because there are actual dates. The system's checklist status shows 1/1 filled, so all required items are covered. The next step should be to stop, as per the stop criteria. The user's previous stop attempt was rejected because it's the first attempt, but now they need to make the second stop.\n\nWait, the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" and they need to call stop again for the second time. So the correct action now is to issue a stop with the reason that all decree dates have been extracted from the relevant documents.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All decree dates (2025-07-07 and 2025-07-21) confirmed in Docket and Order documents.
