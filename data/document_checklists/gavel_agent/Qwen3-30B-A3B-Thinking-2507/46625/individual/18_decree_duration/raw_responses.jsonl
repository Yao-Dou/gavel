The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The main documents that might have court orders or decrees are the Memorandum Opinion, Order, and maybe the Complaint. The Docket might list the order details too.\n\nThe current status shows all documents are unvisited. So I need to start reading some documents. Since the Order [Order/Opinion] is a short document (2,241 tokens), it's a good candidate to read first because it's likely to contain the decree details. The Memorandum Opinion is longer (22k tokens), but maybe the Order is more concise.\n\nWait, the Order document is labeled as [Order/Opinion], so it's probably the actual court order that specifies the decree duration. That's the most direct source. So I should read the entire Order document first. Since it's 2,241 tokens, which is under 10k, I can read it all at once. The start_token should be 0 and end_token 2241.\n\nI should use read_document for the Order document. The other documents might have related info, but starting with the Order makes sense. Let me make sure I'm not missing a better target. The Complaint might mention the relief sought, but the actual decree duration would be in the court's order.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from the legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" item. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the recent actions. The user already read the \"Order\" document (tokens 0-2241), which is fully visited. The Order document mentions \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\" That's a clear decree duration.\n\nThe checklist item requires extracting each duration as a separate value, formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So the value here is \"until October 1, 2025\" for the decree in the Order.\n\nI need to check if there are other documents that might have more decree durations. The available documents include others like the Memorandum Opinion, Complaint, etc., but the Order document already provided a clear duration. However, the user must extract EVERY distinct value from any document. Since the Order has one, I should extract that first.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. The Order was fully read, so the evidence is there. The next step is to append this value to the checklist.\n\nThe evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\" Source is \"Order\", location is page 3 (since it's on page 3 of the document as per the token read).\n\nWait, the document shows page 3, but the location in evidence can be the page number. The token range was 0-2241, but the exact location in the document is page 3.\n\nSo, the extracted value should be \"until October 1, 2025\" with the evidence as specified. The key is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nSince this is the first extraction, I need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist item is empty, so appending the first value. I shouldn't use update_checklist here because it's the first entry, and append is for adding new entries.\n\nCheck if there are other possible durations in the Order. The document only mentions that one date. The other parts talk about the injunction, but the duration is specifically stated as until October 1, 2025.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, but the Order has the value. So the next action is to append this to the checklist.\n\nConfirming the parameters for append_checklist: patch should have key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", extracted array with one entry. Each entry needs evidence (array of evidence items) with text, source_document, location.\n\nThe evidence text is \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\" Source is \"Order\", location is \"Page 3\" (since it's on page 3 as per the document's page numbers).\n\nWait, the document shows \"Case 1:25-cv-01643-APM Document 57 Filed 07/21/25 Page 3 of 4\", so the location should be \"Page 3\".\n\nSo the evidence entry will have text: \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\", source_document: \"Order\", location: \"Page 3\".\n\nThe value to extract is \"until October 1, 2025\", but the instruction says to format as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. Wait, the example says \"formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'.\" But the duration here is \"until October 1, 2025\", and the decree obligation is the injunction. However, the checklist item says \"the duration of decree obligations\", so the value should be the duration part. The example might be indicating to include the duration as the value. So the extracted value is \"until October 1, 2025\".\n\nWait, the checklist requirement says: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\". But the extracted value in the checklist should be the duration part. Wait, no—the instruction says \"each duration as a separate value\", so the value is the duration, like \"until October 1, 2025\", and the formatting example is how it should be presented. But in the extracted entry, the value field should be just the duration string. The example is probably indicating that when reporting, it's in that format, but the value field is the duration.\n\nLooking back: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'.\" So the value to extract is the duration part, so \"until October 1, 2025\" is the value. The [decree obligation] part is part of the context, but the value is the duration.\n\nIn the evidence, the text snippet should include the full sentence, but the value field is just the duration. Wait, no. The value field should be the extracted value, which is the duration. So the value would be \"until October 1, 2025\", and the evidence includes the surrounding text.\n\nYes, that's correct. So in the extracted entry, value: \"until October 1, 2025\", evidence text: the full sentence.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have:\n\nkey: \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\"\n\nextracted: [ { value: \"until October 1, 2025\", evidence: [ { text: \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\", source_document: \"Order\", location: \"Page 3\" } ] } ]\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of evidence objects. Each evidence object has text, source_document, location. So in this case, one evidence entry.\n\nSo the patch should be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"until October 1, 2025\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 3\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nBut the append_checklist function's parameters have \"patch\" as an array of such objects. So the entire patch array will contain one item for this key.\n\nTherefore, the correct JSON for the append_checklist call is to have a patch array with one object.\n\nNow, check if there's any other possible duration in the Order. The document mentions \"until October 1, 2025\" as the end date for the Order. No other durations are mentioned. The other parts talk about the injunction, but the duration is specified there.\n\nSo this is the only value found so far. The user should append this.\n\nNo need to read other documents yet because the value is found. The next action is to append the checklist entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"until October 1, 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "until October 1, 2025", "evidence": [{"text": "This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5963, "completion_tokens": 1618, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they've already found one value in the Order document: \"until October 1, 2025\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've extracted 1 value out of 1 key. The Order document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read that again. The other documents are unvisited. But the task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So I need to check if there are more documents that might contain other decree durations.\n\nThe available documents include the Class Action Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and several motions and briefs. The Order document they read was the one where the decree duration was mentioned. But maybe other documents like the Memorandum Opinion or the Emergency Motion might have additional decrees or related orders.\n\nWait, the checklist specifies \"for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". The Order they read had a decree lasting until October 1, 2025. But are there other court orders in other documents?\n\nThe next step should be to check other documents for similar decrees. Since the Order is fully visited, I should look at another document that's likely to contain a decree. The Memorandum Opinion (22,116 tokens) might have more details. Alternatively, the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (114,973 tokens) could have related info.\n\nBut the user's recent action was appending the value from Order. Now, they need to check other documents. The system says to avoid rereading visited documents. So, the next logical step is to read another document that's unvisited. The Memorandum Opinion is a good candidate because it's a court order document, possibly containing more details.\n\nWait, the Checklist item is about \"decree duration\", which is the time the decree lasts. The Order they read already has one value. But maybe the Memorandum Opinion (which is another Order/Opinion) has another decree duration. For example, maybe the Memorandum Opinion includes a different decree or a longer duration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket has entries with decree durations. But the Docket is usually a log of events, not detailed text. The Complaint might not have decrees since it's the initial filing. The motions and briefs might reference decrees but not state the duration.\n\nSo the best bet is to read the Memorandum Opinion document. It's labeled as Order/Opinion, so it's likely to have court-ordered decrees. Let's check the token count: 22,116 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I can read it in chunks. But the maximum per read is 10,000 tokens. So start from 0-10,000 tokens.\n\nWait, the system says to use read_document for targeted windows. So the next action should be read_document on Memorandum Opinion, tokens 0-10,000. That's within the limit. Then, after reading, check if there's another decree duration.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for \"until\" or \"effective until\" patterns. But the user's instructions say to prefer read_document for targeted reading when the document is likely to contain the info. Since the Memorandum Opinion is a court order, it's a good candidate. So the next action should be read_document on Memorandum Opinion, start 0, end 10,000.\n\nWait, the available documents list \"Memorandum Opinion\" as 22,116 tokens, unvisited. So yes, read the first 10k tokens. That's the most efficient next step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6068, "completion_tokens": 834, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The value is \"until October 1, 2025\" from page 3 of the Order. The Order document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are other documents that might contain more values for this checklist item. The available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" which is partially visited (only tokens 0-10000 read). The user read the first 10,000 tokens, but the document is 22,116 tokens long. There's still unvisited text beyond 10,000 tokens. Since the checklist item might be mentioned later in the document, I should read the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading \"Memorandum Opinion\" from tokens 0-10,000. The next logical step is to continue reading the remaining tokens of that document. The next chunk would be tokens 10,001 to 22,116. But the maximum per read_document call is 10,000 tokens, so I can read up to 20,000 tokens, but the document ends at 22,116. So start_token 10001, end_token 22116. However, the system says to avoid rereading already viewed tokens. The previous read was 0-10000, so next should be 10001-20000, but the document is 22116 tokens, so 10001-22116.\n\nWait, the document's token count is 22,116, and viewed tokens are 0-10000 (10,000 tokens). So the remaining tokens are 10,001 to 22,116. That's 12,116 tokens. But the maximum per read is 10,000, so I need to split it. But the user's next action should be to read the next segment. Since the previous read was 0-10000, the next read should start at 10001. The maximum end_token is 20000 (10,000 tokens from start). So start_token 10001, end_token 20000.\n\nBut the document has 22,116 tokens, so after 20000, there's still 2116 tokens left. However, the system says to read in chunks up to 10,000 tokens. So the next read should be tokens 10001-20000. Then, in the next step, read 20001-22116.\n\nBut the user's current step is to choose the next action. Since the Memorandum Opinion is partially visited, the correct action is to read_document on Memorandum Opinion, starting at 10001, ending at 20000. That's within the 10,000 token limit (10,000 tokens from 10001-20000).\n\nOther documents are unvisited, but the Memorandum Opinion was already partially read, so it's the most relevant to continue. The Order was fully read, and the other documents might not contain the decree duration. The checklist item is about court-ordered decrees, so the Order document already has one. The Memorandum Opinion might have more details or other decrees.\n\nWait, the user's previous step was reading the Memorandum Opinion up to 10,000 tokens, but the document is longer. So the next logical step is to read the next part of that document. The system says not to reread visited tokens, so the next read should be from 10001 onward.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document on Memorandum Opinion with start_token 10001 and end_token 20000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16478, "completion_tokens": 996, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
