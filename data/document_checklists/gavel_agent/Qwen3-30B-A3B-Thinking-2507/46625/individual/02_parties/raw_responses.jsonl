The user needs to extract the parties involved from legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and all keys are empty. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nHmm, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the system can't proceed to read or search any documents. The decision policy says that if the document catalog is unknown, the correct action is to call `list_documents`. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the function that returns all documents with their metadata. Without knowing the documents, there's no way to proceed further. So the next logical step is to list the documents to get the catalog updated.\n\nThe user's current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, definitely, the first action should be to call `list_documents` to discover what documents exist. That's the only option here. The other actions like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require existing documents, which aren't present yet.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not skipping any steps. The system's decision policy clearly states: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call `list_documents`.\" Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is unknown. So the correct action is to call `list_documents` now. No other action makes sense here because there's nothing to read or search without documents.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to issue the `list_documents` function call.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3123, "completion_tokens": 355, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The current status shows all 11 documents are unvisited, and the checklist is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain the parties' information. In legal cases, the Complaint usually lists the parties at the beginning. The document \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is a Complaint, so that's the best starting point. It's also the first in the list, which makes sense for the primary document.\n\nThe next step is to read a portion of this document. Since it's 16,778 tokens, I should read a manageable chunk. The first 10,000 tokens would cover the beginning where the parties are typically named. Using read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 should get the initial part of the Complaint.\n\nI should avoid using search_document_regex here because the parties' names are likely in the header or early sections, not a specific pattern like a case number. So reading the start of the Complaint is the most efficient first move.\n\nChecking the document catalog, all are unvisited, so no need for list_documents. The goal is to get the parties, so starting with the Complaint makes sense. No other documents seem as relevant for initial party identification. The Docket might have parties too, but the Complaint is the primary source.\n\nNeed to make sure the token range is correct. The Complaint is 16k tokens, so 0-10k is safe. The next action should be read_document for that document and range.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3565, "completion_tokens": 411, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The task is to get every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Step 2 was reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Class Action Complaint. The text provided shows the complaint has the parties listed. \n\nLooking at the document excerpt, the complaint starts with the plaintiffs: Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action, FORCE Detroit, Health Resources in Action. Then the defendants: United States Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi (as Attorney General), Office of Justice Programs, Maureen A. Henneberg (Acting Head of OJP).\n\nThe checklist requires the format 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. So each party needs to be categorized with their role. \n\nIn the document, the plaintiffs are listed with their addresses and roles. For example, Vera is described as a New York-based nonprofit. Similarly, the defendants have their positions. \n\nThe user's instruction says to extract every distinct value. So I need to make sure all plaintiffs and defendants are listed with their specific descriptions. The document also has a section \"PARTIES\" on page 5 where it details each plaintiff and defendant.\n\nSo for Plaintiffs: \n- Vera Institute of Justice: New York-based nonprofit\n- Center for Children & Youth Justice: Washington State-based nonprofit\n- Chinese for Affirmative Action (Stop AAPI Hate): Civil Rights coalition\n- FORCE Detroit: Community violence intervention organization\n- Health Resources in Action: Massachusetts-based nonprofit\n\nDefendants:\n- United States Department of Justice: Federal agency\n- Pamela J. Bondi: Attorney General\n- Office of Justice Programs: Subordinate agency of DOJ\n- Maureen A. Henneberg: Acting Head of OJP\n\nEach needs to be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. The evidence should be the exact text from the document, source document name, and location (like page number).\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted. The document read (Class Action Complaint) has all the necessary info. So the next step is to use append_checklist to add these entries. Each entry must have evidence with text, source document, location.\n\nWait, the document is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but the parties section is in the first few pages. The excerpt shows pages 1-20, so the parties are covered in the first 10k tokens. So no need to read more of the document. \n\nCheck if all parties are covered. The plaintiffs listed in the complaint are the five, and defendants are four. The document mentions them in the \"PARTIES\" section (page 5). \n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\nPlaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice (New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice)\nPlaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice (Washington State-based nonprofit working to reform juvenile justice)\nPlaintiff: Chinese for Affirmative Action (Civil Rights coalition dedicated to ending racism against AAPIs)\nPlaintiff: FORCE Detroit (Community violence intervention organization in Detroit)\nPlaintiff: Health Resources in Action (Massachusetts-based nonprofit improving public health)\nDefendant: United States Department of Justice (Federal agency headquartered in DC)\nDefendant: Pamela J. Bondi (Attorney General, sued in official capacity)\nDefendant: Office of Justice Programs (Subordinate agency of DOJ)\nDefendant: Maureen A. Henneberg (Acting Head of OJP, sued in official capacity)\n\nEach of these needs evidence. The text from the document shows these descriptions. For example, Vera's description is on page 5: \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nSo the evidence for Vera would be the text snippet from page 5, source document \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 5\".\n\nSame for others. Need to make sure each entry has the correct evidence.\n\nSince the user's checklist requires each value to be self-contained with context, the evidence should include the verbatim text. \n\nNow, the action is to append these to the checklist. Since it's the first extraction, using append_checklist to add all these entries. Each entry in the extracted list should have evidence with text, source, location.\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Who_are_the_Parties\" can have multiple values, each as a separate entry. So the extracted list will have all the plaintiff and defendant entries.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the patch containing all these values. But need to make sure each is correctly formatted.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the value should be \"Plaintiff: [description]\" etc. So the value field should be exactly that string. The evidence is the text that supports it.\n\nFor example, for Vera:\n\nvalue: \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nevidence: text from the document, source, location.\n\nBut the document says \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\" So the text snippet would be that part.\n\nLocation: Page 5 of the document.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, the append_checklist call should include all these entries. Each entry in the extracted array for the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\".\n\nWait, the key is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", so the patch will have key: \"Who_are_the_Parties\", extracted: [list of entries].\n\nEach entry has evidence (array of evidence items) and value.\n\nWait, the evidence is an array, but each entry in the extracted array has an evidence array. Wait, no: the evidence field in the extracted entry is an array of evidence objects. Each evidence object has text, source, location.\n\nBut for each value, we need one evidence entry. So for each party, one evidence object.\n\nSo for Vera, the evidence would be:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\",\n  \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"location\": \"Page 5\"\n}\n\nAnd value: \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nWait, but the instruction says the value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]'. So the description should be the part from the document. So the value is the formatted string, and the evidence is the text snippet.\n\nSo for Vera, the value is \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nBut the document says \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit...\". So the description is \"New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\".\n\nWait, the value should be 'Plaintiff: [description]', so the [description] is the part after \"Plaintiff: \".\n\nSo the value is \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nWait, but the exact description from the document is \"New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\" So the description part is \"New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\" (maybe omitting \"with a national footprint\" for brevity, but the instruction says \"self-contained with relevant context\". So maybe include the exact phrase.\n\nBut the user's example in the checklist says \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo the [description] should be a concise description from the document. So for Vera, the description is \"New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\".\n\nSo value: \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nBut the document says \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\" So the description includes \"New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nSo maybe the description should be the entire phrase after \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a\".\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"descriptions of each party\", so the value should be the full description as per the document.\n\nSo the value for Vera would be \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit with a national footprint working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nWait, but the example in the task says \"Plaintiff: [description]\", so the [description] is the description, which includes the entity name. Wait, no: the entity name is part of the description. Wait, the instruction says \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\"\n\nSo the description should include the party's name and their role. So for Vera, the description is \"Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nWait, but the example in the problem statement says \"Plaintiff: [description]\". So the [description] is the text that describes the plaintiff, including their name and role.\n\nWait, no. The example given in the checklist definition says \"the extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\" So [description] is a string that describes the party's role or capacity.\n\nSo for Vera, the description is \"New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nSo the value would be \"Plaintiff: New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\"\n\nBut that seems odd because it's missing the party name. Wait, the instruction says \"descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles...\". So the description should include the party name. So perhaps the [description] includes the name.\n\nLooking at the document, the plaintiffs are listed with their names and descriptions. So the value should be \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the description includes the party's name followed by their role.\n\nSo for each plaintiff, the value is \"Plaintiff: [Party Name], [Description]\".\n\nSimilarly for defendants.\n\nSo for Vera: \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nThe evidence text would be the exact line from the document: \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\"\n\nLocation: Page 5.\n\nSimilarly, for Center for Children & Youth Justice: \"Plaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice, Washington State-based nonprofit working to reform juvenile justice systems.\"\n\nEvidence text: \"The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit funded in 2006 by Washington State Supreme Court Justice Bobbe J. Bridge (ret.) to create better lives for generations of children and youth by reforming the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.\"\n\nLocation: Page 5.\n\nSame for others.\n\nSo, compiling all these, the next action is to append all these values to the checklist.\n\nSince the document has been read (partially visited), and the information is present, the correct action is append_checklist with all the entries.\n\nNeed to make sure each entry is correctly formatted with evidence.\n\nSo the patch will have key: \"Who_are_the_Parties\", and extracted array with each entry.\n\nEach extracted entry has evidence (array of one evidence object) and value.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the patch containing all these entries.\n\nNo need to do get_checklist first, since we have the values from the document.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice, New York-based nonprofit working to advance safety and justice\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 5\"}]}], \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 5\"}]}, {\"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice, Washington State-based nonprofit working to reform juvenile justice systems\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit funded in 2006 by Washington State Supreme Court Justice Bobbe J.
