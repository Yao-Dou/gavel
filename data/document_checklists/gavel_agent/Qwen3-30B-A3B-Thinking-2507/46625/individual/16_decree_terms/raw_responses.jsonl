The user is trying to extract Significant_Terms_of_Decrees from legal documents. The current status shows 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item is empty, and there are no documents discovered yet.\n\nHmm, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step is to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, I need to use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none, those can't be used yet. So the only correct action here is to call list_documents to discover the available documents. That's step one in the process.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3166, "completion_tokens": 181, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all significant terms of decrees from the provided documents. First, I need to understand what exactly is required. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to the substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. Important to note that terms from settlement agreements shouldn't be included unless they're expressly incorporated into the court order.\n\nLooking at the current status, all 11 documents are unvisited, and the checklist key is empty. The user has already done a list_documents step, which found 11 documents. So the next step is to start reading documents to find the decree terms.\n\nI should prioritize documents that are most likely to contain the decree terms. The \"Order\" and \"Memorandum Opinion\" documents are probably the best candidates because they are court orders or opinions that would include the decree terms. The \"Order\" document is only 2,241 tokens, which is small, so reading the whole thing might be efficient. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" is larger (22k tokens), but maybe the decree terms are in a specific section.\n\nWait, the \"Order\" document is labeled as [Order/Opinion], so it's likely the actual court order that includes the decree terms. That's probably the most relevant document to read first. The other documents like Complaints, Motions, etc., might have settlement terms but not the court-ordered terms unless they're incorporated. But since the Order is a direct court document, it's the best place to start.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the \"Order\" document. The document is 2,241 tokens, so reading the entire document (start_token 0, end_token 2241) is feasible since it's under 10k tokens. That way, I can check if there are any decree terms mentioned there.\n\nI need to make sure I don't skip over any parts. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the whole thing. After reading, I'll look for terms like \"the Court orders that...\" or specific obligations. Once I have the text, I can extract the terms and then use append_checklist to add them with evidence.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that if a term is only in a settlement agreement, it shouldn't be included unless incorporated. So I need to check if the Order document references the settlement terms. But the Order itself should have the court-ordered terms, so it's the right place.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call read_document on the \"Order\" document with start_token 0 and end_token 2241.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2241}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2241}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3608, "completion_tokens": 602, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Order (tokens 0-2241). The text from that Order was provided. Now, I need to check if the Order contains any decree terms.\n\nThe Order says: \"the court therefore prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements. This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\"\n\nSo the significant terms here are:\n1. Prohibiting re-obligation of terminated grant funds.\n2. The order is effective until October 1, 2025.\n\nWait, the Order is an injunction, so these are the terms. The user said to extract each term as a separate value. So each of these should be a separate entry.\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location here is Page 3, since the text is on page 3 (as per the document headers). The source document is \"Order\", and the exact text is \"prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements\" and \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\"\n\nWait, the Order says \"the court therefore prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements. This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\"\n\nSo two terms: the prohibition on re-obligation and the effective date until Oct 1, 2025.\n\nEach needs to be a separate extracted value with evidence.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", so I should append these two terms. Since they're new, use append_checklist. Each entry must have evidence with text, source_document, and location.\n\nCheck the document status: \"Order\" is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so no need to read it again. The text was already read in Step 2.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with these two entries.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\", so this is the first time extracting. Need to append both terms.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each value must have evidence with text, source, location.\n\nFor the first term: value is \"Prohibition on re-obligation of terminated grant funds\", evidence text is \"prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements\", source is \"Order\", location is \"Page 3\".\n\nSecond term: value is \"Order remains effective until October 1, 2025\", evidence text is \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025\", source \"Order\", location \"Page 3\".\n\nWait, the actual text says \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025.\" So the value should be exactly that phrase, but the user says to extract the terms as separate values. So the terms are the obligations, so \"prohibition on re-obligation\" and \"effective until Oct 1, 2025\" as the terms.\n\nBut the instructions say to extract each term as a separate value. So the exact terms from the order. So the first term is the prohibition part, the second is the effective date.\n\nSo the extracted values would be:\n\n1. \"Prohibition on re-obligation of terminated grant funds\" (from the text)\n2. \"Order remains effective until October 1, 2025\" (from the text)\n\nBut need to make sure the evidence text is the exact snippet. So the evidence text for the first is the exact phrase, and same for the second.\n\nAlso, check if there are any other terms. The Order also mentions \"the parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025\", but that's a procedural step, not a substantive decree term. The decree terms are the obligations ordered, so the prohibition and the effective date are the key terms.\n\nSo two terms to append.\n\nNow, the action is append_checklist with these two entries. The parameters need to have \"patch\" as an array with key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" and extracted list containing both entries.\n\nEach entry in extracted must have evidence (array of one evidence object) and value.\n\nSo the JSON would have patch with key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", extracted as two objects.\n\nCheck the required fields: evidence must have text, source_document, location. Each evidence entry is an array, but since each value has one evidence, the evidence array will have one item.\n\nWait, the evidence field in the extracted entry is an array of evidence objects. Each evidence object has text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for each term, the evidence array has one element.\n\nSo for the first value:\n\nvalue: \"Prohibition on re-obligation of terminated grant funds\"\n\nevidence: [ { text: \"prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements\", source_document: \"Order\", location: \"Page 3\" } ]\n\nSimilarly for the second value.\n\nNow, the location: the document says \"Case 1:25-cv-01643-APM Document 57 Filed 07/21/25 Page 3 of 4\", so location is \"Page 3\".\n\nOkay, so the append_checklist call should include both terms.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, but the Order was fully read, so this is the only place where the decree terms are mentioned. The other documents might have settlement agreements, but the checklist says to only extract terms that are incorporated into the court order. Since the Order is the court order, and the parties agreed to the narrower injunction, those terms are part of the decree.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with these two entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Prohibition on re-obligation of terminated grant funds\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Order remains effective until October 1, 2025\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "Prohibition on re-obligation of terminated grant funds", "evidence": [{"text": "prohibits Defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under Plaintiffs’ grant agreements", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 3"}]}, {"value": "Order remains effective until October 1, 2025", "evidence": [{"text": "This Order shall remain in effect until October 1, 2025", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5979, "completion_tokens": 1536, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting decree terms from legal documents. The checklist item they need to focus on is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". From the recent actions, they've already read the \"Order\" document (tokens 0-2241) and appended two terms from it. The Order is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so they can't read it again.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, there are 10 other documents that are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The task is to extract all distinct values of the checklist item from any document. The previous extraction from the Order gave two terms. But maybe other documents have more terms.\n\nThe next step should be to check if there are other documents that might contain additional decree terms. The \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" item is about substantive obligations ordered by the court. The Order already provided two terms, but perhaps the \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" or other motions might have more terms. However, the \"Order\" is the court's actual order, so the decree terms are most likely in the Order itself. But the user has already read that document fully.\n\nWait, the Order document is fully visited, so they shouldn't read it again. The other documents are complaints, motions, briefs, etc. The decree terms would typically be in the court's order, not in the motions or complaints. But sometimes, the order might reference terms from a settlement, but the checklist says to only include terms expressly incorporated into the court order. So the main document to check is the Order, which they've already done.\n\nBut the current status shows that all keys (only one key here) are filled with 2 values. The checklist summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning they have one key with values, and no empty or Not Applicable keys. The total values extracted are 2. The user needs to make sure they have all possible terms. Since the Order is the only document that would contain the court's decree, and it's fully read, maybe they're done.\n\nWait, the \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (document 11) is 114,973 tokens, which is large, but the motion itself might not have the decree terms. The decree terms would be in the court's order. The Order they read (Document 57) is the court's order, so that's where the decree terms should be. Since they've read that fully and extracted two terms, and the other documents are motions or complaints which don't contain the court's decree, maybe there are no more terms to extract.\n\nBut the user should confirm. The next step could be to use `get_checklist` to verify if there are any remaining keys. However, there's only one key, and it's already filled. The checklist summary shows all keys are filled. So perhaps the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, the Stop Criteria say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" has two values, and the Order is fully visited. No other documents are likely to contain the decree terms. So they should stop.\n\nBut the user needs to make sure they didn't miss any. Let me check the documents again. The available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" (22k tokens) and \"Order\" (2.2k), which they read. The Memorandum Opinion might have more details, but the Order is the actual order. The \"Order\" document they read is the court's order, so the decree terms are there. The Memorandum Opinion is the opinion explaining the order, but the terms themselves would be in the Order.\n\nIn the Order they read, they found two terms. The checklist says to extract each term as a separate value. So they have two terms. The other documents like the Complaint or Motions are filed by the parties, not the court's order. So no more terms should be found.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop.
