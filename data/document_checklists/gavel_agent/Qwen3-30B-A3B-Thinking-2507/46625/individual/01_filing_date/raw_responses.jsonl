The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty, and there are 11 unvisited documents. The first step is to figure out which document is most likely to contain the filing date. In legal cases, the complaint is usually the first document filed, so the \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is a prime candidate. The docket might also have the filing date, but the complaint is more direct.\n\nThe user mentioned that the document catalog is known (they listed 11 documents after Step 1's list_documents), so no need for another list_documents. The next logical step is to read the complaint document. Since it's unvisited, I should read a portion of it. The complaint is 16,778 tokens, so I can read the first 10,000 tokens to check for the filing date. The start_token is 0, end_token 10000. That's within the limit. \n\nI should avoid searching with regex first because the filing date is likely in the header or beginning of the complaint. Reading the start makes sense. So the correct action here is read_document for the Complaint, first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3533, "completion_tokens": 343, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot where they've already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Class Action Complaint. In that document, on page 1, it says \"Filed 05/21/25\". So the filing date is May 21, 2025.\n\nI need to check if this is the only instance. The document catalog shows other documents, but the current status says that Filing_Date is empty. Since the complaint is the first document and it's a complaint, the filing date is likely there. The document's metadata shows it's a Complaint, so the filing date would be on the first page.\n\nLooking at the text they read: \"Case 1:25-cv-01643 Document 1 Filed 05/21/25 Page 1 of 33\". So the date is 05/21/25, which is May 21, 2025. The format is MM/DD/YY, so 05/21/25 is May 21, 2025.\n\nThe checklist item is Filing_Date, and they need to extract the calendar date. The evidence here is the \"Filed\" field in the document. The source document is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location is \"Page 1 of 33\" (or token range 0-10000, but the specific location is the header on page 1).\n\nSince they've found the value, the next step is to append it to the checklist. The value is \"05/21/25\", but the requirement says to extract the calendar date. Wait, the problem states \"calendar date\", so maybe they need it in a standard format like May 21, 2025. But the document uses 05/21/25, so the exact string from the document should be used. The instructions say to include the verbatim snippet. So the evidence should have \"Filed 05/21/25\" as the text.\n\nWait, the user's example in the requirements says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so if there's only one, that's it. The document is the complaint, which is the first filing, so this should be the filing date. The other documents might be motions or orders filed later, but the Filing_Date refers to the initial filing, which would be the complaint.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"05/21/25\", with evidence from the document's header. The location is \"Page 1 of 33\" as per the document's header. The source document is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSince this is the first time they're finding the value, they need to use append_checklist to add it. The checklist key is Filing_Date, and the extracted entry should have the value \"05/21/25\" (as written in the document), with evidence including the text snippet, source, and location.\n\nWait, the document says \"Filed 05/21/25\", so the value is \"05/21/25\". The user might need to standardize it, but the instructions say to use verbatim. So the value should be exactly as in the document.\n\nSo the action is append_checklist with the key Filing_Date, and the extracted entry with value \"05/21/25\", evidence text \"Filed 05/21/25\", source \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 1 of 33\".\n\nNo other documents need to be read yet because the filing date is found in the complaint.

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done Steps 1-3. Step 1 was listing documents, Step 2 was reading the first 10,000 tokens of the Class Action Complaint, and Step 3 was appending the Filing_Date value \"05/21/25\" from that document.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Filing_Date has one value, and the document catalog has 11 documents. The Class Action Complaint was partially visited (0-10000 tokens out of 16,778), so there's more to read there. But the Filing_Date was found on page 1, which was included in the first 10k tokens. The document shows \"Filed 05/21/25\" on the first page, so that's the filing date.\n\nWait, but the checklist item says to extract EVERY distinct value. So maybe there are other documents that have different filing dates? But the complaint is the first document filed, so the filing date should be the same across all documents. However, the system might need to check other documents to confirm, but the user's instructions say to extract every distinct value. If other documents have the same filing date, it's still one distinct value. But maybe the system needs to verify that there's only one filing date.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"05/21/25\". The document shows \"Filed 05/21/25\" on the first page. The document is labeled as Document 1, which is typically the complaint filed first. So that's the filing date. The other documents might be subsequent filings, but their filing dates would be later. However, the checklist item is \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing date is the one from the complaint, which is already extracted.\n\nBut the user's recent action was appending that value. Now, the system needs to check if there are any other documents that might have a different filing date. However, the first document (the complaint) is the one that has the initial filing date. Other documents like the docket, motions, etc., would be filed later, but the \"Filing_Date\" as per the checklist refers to the initial filing of the lawsuit, not subsequent filings.\n\nSo, the correct value is \"05/21/25\" from the complaint. Since the complaint's first page (which was read) has that date, and the document is the initial filing, there's no need to read other documents for this value. The checklist item should have only one value, which is already extracted.\n\nThe current status shows 1/1 keys with values.

The recent action was appending the value, and now the checklist is fully filled. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut let me double-check. The user's Step 3 was append_checklist, which added the value. Now, the checklist summary shows 1 key with values. There are no empty keys or Not Applicable. So all required keys are done.
