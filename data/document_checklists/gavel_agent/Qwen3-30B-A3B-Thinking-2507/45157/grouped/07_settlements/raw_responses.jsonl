The available documents include a \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" which might contain settlement terms. Also, the \"Docket\" might have dates and court orders.\n\nBut the user can't read all documents at once. They need to pick the most relevant one first. The \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" is a good candidate because it's a settlement document. The name suggests it's a settlement, so it might have the terms and date.\n\nThe other documents like complaints and motions might not have the settlement details.

It's 1,125 tokens, which is under 10k, so read_document is safe.\n\nCheck if it's unvisited: yes, it's marked as ○ Unvisited. So the next action should be read_document on that document.

Since it's unvisited, read the entire document from 0 to 1125.\n\nWait, the token count is 1,125, so the tokens are from 0 to 1125. So start_token 0, end_token 1125. That's within the 10k limit.

The user needs to extract five specific checklist items from legal documents, and so far, they've only read the \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" document. From the snapshot, that document was fully visited (tokens 0-1125), but it's a dismissal without prejudice, so settlement-related items might not be present here.\n\nLooking at the checklist items:\n- Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: The stipulation mentions dismissal without prejudice, each side bears their own costs. But this isn't a settlement; it's a voluntary dismissal. So probably no terms here.\n- Date_of_Settlement: The document is dated August 6, 2024, but it's a dismissal, not a settlement. Settlement date would require a different document.\n- How_Long_Settlement_will_Last: Not applicable here since it's a dismissal.\n- Whether_Court-enforced: The dismissal is without prejudice, so not court-enforced as a settlement.\n- Disputes_Over_Settlement: No disputes mentioned here.\n\nSo the Stipulation document doesn't have settlement info. The user needs to look elsewhere. The next step is to find documents that might contain settlement details. The Docket might have settlement entries, but the user hasn't checked it yet. Alternatively, the \"Decision and Order\" documents could have settlement-related info.\n\nThe available documents include \"Docket\" (unvisited), \"Decision and Order (001)\", \"Decision and Order (002)\", and others. Since the Stipulation was a dismissal, the settlement might be in a later document. The Docket is a good candidate because it lists all filings, including settlements.\n\nBut the user should check if any document mentions \"settlement\" or \"consent decree\" to target. Using `search_document_regex` with a pattern like \"settlement\" or \"consent decree\" across all documents might be efficient. However, the policy says to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. Since the checklist items are about settlement, searching for \"settlement\" in the Docket or other documents makes sense.\n\nWait, the Stipulation was a dismissal without prejudice, so the case was dismissed, not settled. But the user needs to check if there's a settlement elsewhere. The Docket might show a settlement entry. So, searching the Docket for \"settlement\" could be useful.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Motion to Certify Class\" or other documents might mention settlement terms. But the Docket is the most likely place to find a settlement entry. So, the next action should be to search the Docket document for \"settlement\" using `search_document_regex`.\n\nWait, the Docket is unvisited, so the user can't read it yet. But to be efficient, using `search_document_regex` on the Docket (doc_name='Docket') with pattern 'settlement' would find relevant sections, then they can read those parts.\n\nThe policy says: \"When you have confirmed text for one or more keys, use append_checklist or update_checklist.\" But here, they haven't found any values yet, so they need to search for the terms.\n\nSo the correct next action is to use `search_document_regex` on the Docket document with pattern 'settlement' to find where settlement is mentioned.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"settlement\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "settlement", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5033, "completion_tokens": 746, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user has provided a snapshot of the current state, and I need to extract five specific checklist items from the legal case documents. \n\nFirst, I'll review the recent actions. Step 1 was listing documents, which found 12 documents. Step 2 was reading the Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal document (tokens 0-1125), which was fully visited. Step 3 was a regex search for \"settlement\" in the Docket, but it found zero matches. \n\nLooking at the current status, all five checklist items are empty. The Stipulation document was fully read, but it's a dismissal without prejudice, not a settlement. The key phrase here is \"dismissed without prejudice,\" which means no settlement was reached. So for the settlement-related items, this might mean they're Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. The checklist items are about settlement, but the document is a dismissal. The user's instructions say not to mark Not Applicable just because you haven't found it yet. But in this case, the dismissal explicitly states \"without prejudice\" and mentions no settlement. Let me check the document again.\n\nThe Stipulation says: \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiffs move and stipulate that this case should be dismissed. Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees. Defendants do not object to the dismissal of this action.\"\n\nSo there's no settlement mentioned here. The case is being dismissed without prejudice, meaning no settlement agreement. Therefore, for all settlement-related items (Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, Date_of_Settlement, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not, Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement), they should be marked as Not Applicable because the case was dismissed without a settlement.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence. The dismissal without prejudice is a clear indication that there was no settlement. So for each of these five keys, I should set them to Not Applicable via update_checklist.\n\nWait, but the checklist items are about settlement, and since the case was dismissed without prejudice, there was no settlement. So all five items should be Not Applicable. However, the Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry per key with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence.\n\nSo I need to use update_checklist to replace the empty lists with a single Not Applicable entry for each key. The evidence would be the relevant part of the Stipulation document, specifically the \"dismissed without prejudice\" part.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to use update_checklist for Not Applicable. So for each key, I should create a patch entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the document.\n\nWait, but the current state shows all keys are empty, so I need to update each one to Not Applicable. However, the system allows batching multiple keys in one update_checklist call. So I can include all five keys in a single update_checklist action.\n\nLet me check the evidence requirements. For each key, the evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The relevant text is \"dismissed without prejudice\" from the Stipulation document, page 1 (tokens 0-1125, but the specific part is in the body).\n\nThe document is \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", and the text is on page 1. The exact quote is \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\"\n\nSo for each of the five checklist items, the evidence would be that quote. But since it's the same evidence for all, I can reference it once per key.\n\nWait, but each key needs its own entry. So for each key in the patch, I'll have a single extracted entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and the evidence.\n\nSo the update_checklist patch should have five entries, one for each key, each with the same evidence (the dismissal text) but different keys.\n\nLet me structure the JSON for update_checklist. The patch array will have five objects, each with key (e.g., \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\"), and extracted array with one entry: evidence (text, source, location), value \"Not Applicable\".\n\nThe location should be \"Page 1 of 3\" as per the document header.\n\nNow, checking if I should do this now. The Stipulation was fully read, and the dismissal without prejudice is clear evidence that there's no settlement. So all five items should be Not Applicable.\n\nThe recent action history shows that the Stipulation was read, so I have the text. The search for \"settlement\" found nothing, but the dismissal text confirms no settlement.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist to set all five keys to Not Applicable.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other documents that might have settlement info, but the current state shows that the Stipulation (which is the only one read) indicates dismissal without prejudice, and the other documents are unvisited. However, since the case is dismissed without prejudice, it's clear that there's no settlement. So even if other documents exist, they wouldn't have settlement terms because the case was dismissed. So it's safe to mark all as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value\". But here, the evidence is explicit: the dismissal is without prejudice, meaning no settlement. So it's not just failure to find; it's a positive indication of no settlement.\n\nYes, so this qualifies as dispositive evidence. Therefore, I should proceed with updating all five keys to Not Applicable.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}]}]}], \"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Date_of_Settlement\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}]}]}], \"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}]}]}], \"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}]}]}], \"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.", "source_document": "Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5063, "completion_tokens": 1672, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The available documents include the Docket, which is unvisited. The Docket might have dates and other settlement-related info. The checklist items need dates, settlement terms, etc.\n\nThe Date_of_Settlement should be a specific date. The Stipulation had \"Dated August 6, 2024,\" but that's for the dismissal, not the settlement. Wait, the Stipulation says \"dismissal without prejudice,\" so maybe there's no actual settlement, which is why Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement is Not Applicable. But the Date_of_Settlement might still be needed if there was a settlement. However, the Stipulation mentions dismissal without prejudice, which usually means no settlement was reached. But the checklist might still require checking other documents.\n\nWait, the user's Step 2 read the Stipulation, which says \"dismissal without prejudice,\" so maybe there was no settlement. But the Date_of_Settlement is still listed as empty. The Docket might have a settlement date if it exists. But since the Stipulation says \"without prejudice,\" perhaps the settlement didn't happen. But the checklist items need to be checked.\n\nThe Docket document is unvisited and has 5,623 tokens. The Docket might list the date the case was dismissed, which could be the Date_of_Settlement. Wait, the Stipulation's date is August 6, 2024, but that's the date of the stipulation, not necessarily the settlement. The case was dismissed without prejudice, so maybe there's no settlement.

The Docket might list the date the dismissal was entered, which could be the Date_of_Settlement. But if the case was dismissed without prejudice, there's no settlement, so the Date_of_Settlement might be Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user has to extract values based on the documents.

The Docket is unvisited, so call read_document with doc_name \"Docket\" and start_token 0, end_token 5623 (since it's the whole document, and it's under 10k tokens).

The user needs to extract five specific checklist items from legal documents. So far, they've already handled the Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement key by marking it as Not Applicable based on the Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal document. Now, the remaining four keys are empty: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, Date_of_Settlement, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, and Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket and Stipulation documents are fully visited, but the other 10 documents are unvisited. The Stipulation document mentions a dismissal \"without prejudice\" with costs borne by each side, but that's already used for the Not Applicable entry. The Docket shows the case was terminated on August 6, 2024, via the Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal (ECF No. 63). Wait, the Date_of_Settlement should be the date the settlement was reached. The Stipulation is dated August 6, 2024, and the Docket entry 63 says it was filed on that date. So Date_of_Settlement might be August 6, 2024. But the checklist says the value should be formatted as '[date]: [settlement]'. The settlement here is a dismissal without prejudice, so maybe \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs.\"\n\nBut wait, the user needs to check if there's a formal settlement. The Stipulation is a voluntary dismissal, not a settlement. The checklist items mention \"settlement,\" but the documents refer to dismissal. The user should verify if the dismissal counts as a settlement here. The Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement was marked Not Applicable because there's no settlement dispute, but the settlement itself might not exist. However, the Stipulation does state \"such dismissal shall be without prejudice,\" which might be the key point. But the checklist items are about settlement terms, so if there's no actual settlement (just dismissal), maybe those keys are also Not Applicable. But the user needs to check the documents first.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 63 is the Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal filed on August 6, 2024. The case was terminated on that date. So Date_of_Settlement could be August 6, 2024. But the checklist says \"settlement,\" not dismissal. However, in legal terms, a dismissal without prejudice might be considered a form of settlement if the parties agreed to it. The Stipulation says \"Plaintiffs move and stipulate that this case should be dismissed... without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\" So the terms here are \"dismissal without prejudice\" and \"each side bears own costs.\" So Significant_Terms_of_Settlement would include those terms. The date is August 6, 2024. How_Long_Settlement_will_Last might not apply because it's a dismissal, not a long-term settlement. Whether it's court-enforced: the dismissal is by stipulation, so it's court-approved (since it's a Stipulation filed with the court), so it's court-enforced. Wait, the Stipulation says \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\", which is a rule for voluntary dismissal, so the court would enter an order, making it court-enforced.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. The Docket entry 62 says the motion to stay was dismissed as moot, and entry 63 is the Stipulation. Then entry 62 is the order dismissing the stay motion, and entry 63 is the Stipulation. Wait, entry 63 is the Stipulation filed on 8/6/24. The termination entry (62?) says \"Case Terminated without prejudice... pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii). See ECF No 63 Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal.\" So the settlement (dismissal) date is August 6, 2024.\n\nSo for Date_of_Settlement: \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs.\"\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Settlement: \"Dismissal without prejudice; each side to bear their own costs and fees.\"\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: Since it's a dismissal, there's no duration, so maybe Not Applicable. But the user needs to check if any document mentions a duration. The Stipulation doesn't mention duration, so this might be Not Applicable.\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: The dismissal was by stipulation under FRCP 41, which requires court approval, so it's court-enforced. So \"Yes\".\n\nWait, but the user has to extract evidence. The Stipulation is the document, and it's signed by both parties and filed with the court. The Docket shows it's ECF No. 63, so it's part of the court record, meaning it's court-enforced.\n\nSo the next step is to extract these values. The Stipulation document is already fully read (tokens 0-1125), so the text is available. The user should use append_checklist or update_checklist to add these entries.\n\nBut the user can't append multiple keys in one call; they have to do one action per turn. Wait, the append_checklist allows batching multiple keys in one call. The tool description says \"You MAY batch multiple checklist keys in ONE call by adding multiple items to patch.\"\n\nSo for each key, they can add the entries. Let's check each:\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Settlement: The terms are \"dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\" So the value is that phrase. Evidence: from the Stipulation, the line \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\"\n\nDate_of_Settlement: The date is August 6, 2024. The document is dated August 6, 2024. Format as \"[date]: [settlement]\". So \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs.\"\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: The settlement here is a dismissal, so there's no duration. The checklist says \"duration terms of settlement obligations or monitoring periods.\" Since it's a dismissal, no obligations, so this should be Not Applicable. But the user needs to confirm. If there's no mention of duration, then it's Not Applicable. So they need to set this key to Not Applicable via update_checklist.\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: Yes, because it's a stipulation filed with the court under FRCP 41, so the court approved it. So \"Yes\".\n\nWait, the Stipulation says \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii)\", which is a rule for voluntary dismissal by stipulation, so the court's order would make it enforceable. So the answer is Yes.\n\nNow, the user has to check if the Stipulation document has the evidence. The Stipulation's text includes the date and the terms.\n\nSo for the next action, they should use append_checklist for Significant_Terms_of_Settlement and Date_of_Settlement, and update_checklist for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last (to Not Applicable) and Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not (to Yes).\n\nBut the user must do one action per turn. So the next step is to append the values for Significant_Terms and Date, then handle the others. Wait, but the user can batch multiple keys in one append_checklist call. So they can add both keys in one call.\n\nLet's structure the evidence:\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Settlement:\n- Value: \"Dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\"\n- Evidence: from Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, page 1, \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\"\n\nFor Date_of_Settlement:\n- Value: \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs.\"\n- Evidence: from Stipulation's date line: \"Dated August 6, 2024\" and the terms.\n\nFor How_Long_Settlement_will_Last: No evidence of duration, so Not Applicable. But the user needs to confirm. The Stipulation doesn't mention duration, so it's Not Applicable. So they'll need to use update_checklist for that key.\n\nFor Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: \"Yes\". Evidence: the Stipulation is filed under FRCP 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which requires court approval, so it's court-enforced.\n\nSo the next action should be to append the first two keys and update the last two. But since append_checklist can handle multiple keys, and update_checklist can handle multiple keys, the user can do all four in one turn. Wait, but the policy says \"choose exactly one action per turn.\" So they have to do one function call. The best way is to use append_checklist for the two keys that have values, and then in subsequent turns, handle the Not Applicable and the Yes.\n\nWait, but the user can batch in one append_checklist call. Let's check the tool's parameters. The append_checklist's patch parameter is an array of patches, each with a key and extracted entries. So they can include both keys in one call.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with both Significant_Terms_of_Settlement and Date_of_Settlement.\n\nThen, for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, since there's no duration mentioned, they'll set it to Not Applicable via update_checklist. Similarly, Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not should be \"Yes\", so they can append that via append_checklist (since it's a single value).\n\nWait, but \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\" should be a single value \"Yes\", so append_checklist can add that. But the user needs to confirm evidence. The Stipulation is filed with the court, so it's court-enforced. The evidence is the Stipulation itself, which is a court document.\n\nWait, the user should check if the Stipulation is court-enforced. The document is titled \"STIPULATION OF VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL\" and it's filed with the court, so the court would enter an order, making it enforceable. So \"Yes\" is correct.\n\nSo the next action is to append the values for Significant_Terms, Date, and Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not. How_Long_Settlement_will_Last should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut since the user can only do one action, and they have to choose one, the best is to append the three keys that have values (Significant_Terms, Date, and Court-enforced), and then in the next turn, handle How_Long as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the user can batch in one append_checklist call. So they can include all three keys in the append_checklist. How_Long is empty, so they'll handle it later.\n\nSo for the next action, append_checklist with the three keys.\n\nLet's structure the JSON:\n\nFor Significant_Terms_of_Settlement:\n- key: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\"\n- extracted: [\n  {\n    \"value\": \"Dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees\",\n    \"evidence\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\",\n        \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n        \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nFor Date_of_Settlement:\n- key: \"Date_of_Settlement\"\n- extracted: [\n  {\n    \"value\": \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs\",\n    \"evidence\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Dated August 6, 2024,\",\n        \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n        \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nFor Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not:\n- key: \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\"\n- extracted: [\n  {\n    \"value\": \"Yes\",\n    \"evidence\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiffs move and stipulate that this case should be dismissed.\",\n        \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n        \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last is still empty, so it's not handled yet.\n\nThe user should make sure the evidence is correctly cited. The Stipulation's date line says \"Dated August 6, 2024,\" and the terms are in the body. For the Court-enforced, the FRCP reference indicates it's a court-approved dismissal.\n\nSo the next action is to append these three keys. The user can do this in one append_checklist call.\n\nThe remaining key, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, will need to be set to Not Applicable. But since there's no evidence of duration, the user should check if any other document mentions duration. However, the other documents are unvisited, but the user has to use the Stipulation first. Since the Stipulation doesn't mention duration, it's safe to mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user can't set it to Not Applicable yet in this action; they have to do it in a separate update_checklist call. So after appending the three keys, the next step would be to update How_Long to Not Applicable.\n\nBut for now, the immediate action is to append the three keys.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Date_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Dated August 6, 2024,\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Yes\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiffs move and stipulate that this case should be dismissed.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "Dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees", "evidence": [{"text": "Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.", "source_document": "Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}]}]}, {"key": "Date_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "August 6, 2024: Dismissal without prejudice with each side bearing their own costs", "evidence": [{"text": "Dated August 6, 2024,", "source_document": "Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}]}]}, {"key": "Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not", "extracted": [{"value": "Yes", "evidence": [{"text": "Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiffs move and stipulate that this case should be dismissed.", "source_document": "Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11036, "completion_tokens": 3491, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all checklist items from the legal case documents. The current status shows that four keys have values or are marked as Not Applicable, but one key is still empty: \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\".\n\nLooking at the available documents, most are unvisited except Docket and Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, which are fully visited. The empty key is about the duration of the settlement. The Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal mentioned dismissal without prejudice, but didn't specify a duration. The Docket also doesn't mention any settlement duration.\n\nThe next step should be to check the remaining unvisited documents for any mention of settlement duration. The document \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" was fully read, and it's the only one with settlement details. The other documents like Complaints, Motions, and Orders probably don't contain settlement terms since the case was dismissed without prejudice. However, the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" key is empty, so I need to confirm if any other documents might have this info.\n\nWait, the checklist item requires the duration terms of settlement obligations. Since the settlement was a dismissal without prejudice, there might not be any duration. But the user's task says to mark Not Applicable only if there's explicit evidence. The current status shows that \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is marked as Not Applicable because the dismissal was without prejudice. For \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", since there's no settlement with duration (just dismissal), it might also be Not Applicable. But the system requires explicit evidence to mark it as Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the previous step had \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" set to Not Applicable based on the dismissal without prejudice. Similarly, for \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", if there's no duration specified because the case was dismissed, then it should also be Not Applicable. But I need to confirm that no other documents have any mention of duration.\n\nThe available documents include things like Class Action Complaints, Motions, etc., but they're all about the case before dismissal. The settlement terms in the Stipulation don't mention duration, just that it's without prejudice. So, there's no duration to extract. Therefore, \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the system says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" The dismissal without prejudice implies no ongoing settlement obligations, hence no duration. The evidence here would be the text from the Stipulation stating \"without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\" Since there's no duration, it's logically dispositive that the settlement doesn't have a duration term.\n\nSo, the next action should be to use update_checklist to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" to Not Applicable with the evidence from the Stipulation.\n\nWait, the current status says \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" is empty. But based on the evidence, it should be Not Applicable. So, I need to update that key to \"Not Applicable\" using update_checklist, not append. Because append would add values, but here we're setting it to Not Applicable.\n\nThe correct action is to call update_checklist for \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" with the value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the Stipulation. The evidence would be the same as the dismissal terms: \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\" This shows there's no settlement duration, hence Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next tool call should be update_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" and the extracted entry having value \"Not Applicable\" and the evidence from the Stipulation.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.\", \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 3\"}], \"value\": \"Not Applicable\"}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"evidence": [{"text": "Such dismissal shall be without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees.", "source_document": "Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "Page 1 of 3"}], "value": "Not Applicable"}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11420, "completion_tokens": 933, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
