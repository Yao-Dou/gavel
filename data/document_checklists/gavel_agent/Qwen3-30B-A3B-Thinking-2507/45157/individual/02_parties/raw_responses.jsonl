The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and all keys are empty. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nHmm, the first step here is to figure out what documents are available. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the system can't proceed to read or search anything. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog hasn't been discovered yet. So the correct action is to list the documents to find out what's available.\n\nI should check the tools provided. The `list_documents` function doesn't require any parameters, so it's the right choice here. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents exist. The user can't extract anything from non-existent documents. So the next logical step is to call `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3123, "completion_tokens": 241, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The user needs every distinct value formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain this information. The checklist item is about parties, so the complaint documents would be the primary sources. The \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" are the most relevant. They're both Complaints, which typically list the parties at the beginning.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaints are unvisited (○ Unvisited). The Docket might have party info too, but complaints are more likely to have the full details. The other documents like Answers, Motions, and Stipulations might reference parties but probably not list them as comprehensively as the initial complaints.\n\nSince the user mentioned to read a targeted window, I should start with the first Complaint. The document is 19,324 tokens, so reading the first part (maybe the first 10,000 tokens) makes sense. The parties are usually in the first few pages of a complaint, so starting from token 0 to 10,000 should cover it.\n\nI should use read_document for \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" from start_token 0 to 10,000. That's within the 10k token limit. No need for regex search here because the parties are likely in the opening paragraphs, so reading the beginning is straightforward.\n\nNo other documents need to be checked yet. The other Complaint might have amendments, but the first one should have the initial parties. If the first Complaint doesn't have it, then check the amended one. But for now, start with the first document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3522, "completion_tokens": 455, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The task is to find all distinct party descriptions, formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the first document they've read is the \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" from tokens 0-10000. The text shows a section titled \"PARTIES\" with Plaintiffs and Defendants listed.\n\nIn the Plaintiffs section, there are 10 individuals listed: John M. Anderson, Patrick Korkowski, Kenneth Dalberg, Edgar Salinas-Leal, Brad Schmitt, Jayvon Flemming, Jason Natcone, Justin Welch, Ashton Dreiling, and Kevin Burkes. Each has a brief description of their situation.\n\nFor Defendants, it's Wisconsin Department of Corrections, and specific individuals: Kevin A. Carr (Secretary), Jared Hoy (Deputy Secretary), Melissa Roberts (Assistant Deputy Secretary), Randall Hepp (Warden), and Yana Pushich (Security Director). The text mentions they're in their official capacities.\n\nI need to format each entry as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. The descriptions should include their roles or capacities as mentioned. For example, \"Plaintiff: John M. Anderson, a 62 year old inmate at WCI diagnosed with a severe eye medical condition...\" but the exact wording from the document is needed.\n\nThe evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location here is the document name and the page numbers mentioned (e.g., Page 4 of 41, Document 1). The tokens read are 0-10000, but the specific text is from the PARTIES section which starts around page 4.\n\nI should check if there are more parties in other documents, but the current step is to process the document they've already read. Since the user has only read the first 10k tokens of the complaint, and the PARTIES section is within that (since it's on page 4, which is within the first 10k tokens), I can extract all the parties listed there.\n\nSo, the next action should be to append the extracted values using append_checklist. Each plaintiff and defendant needs a separate entry with their evidence. The evidence for each will be the specific paragraph from the document, the document name, and the location (page number as in the text).\n\nWait, the document shows \"Page 4 of 41\" for the first plaintiff, so the location would be \"Page 4 of 41\" or \"Page 4\" since the document number is given as Document 1. The exact location as per the text is \"Page 4 of 41\" but maybe just \"Page 4\" is sufficient.\n\nI need to make sure each entry has the correct evidence. For example, for John M. Anderson, the text says \"Plaintiff John M. Anderson is a 62 year old inmate at WCI. He was diagnosed with a severe eye medical condition since May 2023...\" so the evidence text would be that exact sentence.\n\nSame for each plaintiff and defendant. The defendants' descriptions include their titles, so \"Defendant: Wisconsin Department of Corrections, an entity run by the State of Wisconsin...\" but the exact text is in the document.\n\nWait, the document lists Defendants as \"Wisconsin Department of Corrections; KEVIN A. CARR, SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; JARED HOY, DEPUTY SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; etc.\" So the defendants are listed with their titles.\n\nSo for each defendant, the description would be their title and role. For example, \"Defendant: Kevin A. Carr, Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\".\n\nThe task says to format as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]', so the description includes the role.\n\nNow, to create the extracted entries. Each will have the value as the formatted string, and evidence with the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nFor the Plaintiffs, each of the 10 individuals is listed with their own paragraph, so 10 entries. For Defendants, there's the department and the individuals, so 5 entries (WDOC, Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp, Pushich). Wait, the document lists them as \"Wisconsin Department of Corrections; KEVIN A. CARR, SECRETARY...; JARED HOY, DEPUTY SECRETARY...; MELISSA ROBERTS, ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY...; RANDALL HEPP, WARDEN...; and YANA PUSHICH, SECURITY DIRECTION...\". So that's 5 defendants (the department plus four individuals, but the department is a separate entity). Wait, the defendants are listed as a group: \"Wisconsin Department of Corrections; KEVIN A. CARR...; etc.\" So the department is a defendant, and the individuals are also defendants in their official capacities.\n\nSo the defendant entries would be:\n\n- Defendant: Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n- Defendant: Kevin A. Carr, Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n- Defendant: Jared Hoy, Deputy Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n- Defendant: Melissa Roberts, Assistant Deputy Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n- Defendant: Randall Hepp, Warden, Waupun Correctional\n- Defendant: Yana Pushich, Security Director, Waupun Correctional\n\nWait, the document says \"YANA PUSHICH, SECURITY DIRECTION, WAUPUN CORRECTIONAL\" – probably a typo for \"Director\". But the evidence should use the exact text.\n\nSo the value for each defendant would be the exact description as per the document. For example, \"Defendant: Wisconsin Department of Corrections\" as per the first line under Defendants.\n\nWait, the first line under Defendants is \"WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; KEVIN A. CARR, SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; JARED HOY, DEPUTY SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; MELISSA ROBERTS, ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; RANDALL HEPP, WARDEN, WAUPUN CORRECTIONAL, and YANA PUSHICH, SECURITY DIRECTION, WAUPUN CORRECTIONAL in their official capacities.\"\n\nSo the defendant entities are:\n\n1. Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n2. Kevin A. Carr, Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n3. Jared Hoy, Deputy Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n4. Melissa Roberts, Assistant Deputy Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n5. Randall Hepp, Warden, Waupun Correctional\n6. Yana Pushich, Security Direction, Waupun Correctional\n\nBut the task says to format as 'Defendant: [description]', so the description is the full title as listed. So each of these six entries.\n\nWait, the text says \"WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; KEVIN A. CARR, SECRETARY, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS;...\" so each is a separate defendant. So six defendant entries.\n\nSimilarly, the Plaintiffs are 10 individuals, each with their own description.\n\nSo total of 16 entries: 10 plaintiffs, 6 defendants.\n\nNow, for each, the evidence needs to be the exact text from the document. For example, for John M. Anderson, the text starts with \"Plaintiff John M. Anderson is a 62 year old inmate at WCI...\" so the evidence text would be that sentence.\n\nThe location for each would be the page number as in the document. The document shows \"Page 4 of 41\" for the first plaintiff, so location is \"Page 4 of 41\" or \"Page 4\" (since the document is labeled as Document 1, the page number is sufficient).\n\nThe source document is \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\".\n\nSo, the next step is to use append_checklist to add all these entries. Each entry will have its own evidence with text, source_document, and location.\n\nWait, the user's current status shows 0 values extracted, so we need to append all these. The action should be append_checklist with the patch containing all the extracted values.\n\nBut the problem is that the current read_document was for tokens 0-10000, which includes the PARTIES section (pages 4-8), so all the plaintiffs and defendants are in that range. So we can extract them now.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call append_checklist with all the extracted entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: John M.

Since the complaint already lists all parties, and the other documents might not add new parties (they're responses, motions, etc.), it's unlikely there are more parties to extract.\n\nThe current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 16\", which matches the 10 plaintiffs and 6 defendants. So all values are already extracted. The next step would be to verify if all are present. Since the checklist item is complete, they should stop.\n\nWait, the system says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with 16 values. There's no empty keys or Not Applicable. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nThe user's recent actions already appended all the values. The last step was append_checklist with 16 entries. Now, the system should confirm that all values are extracted and then stop.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop. The JSON would be {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All 16 parties extracted from the complaint; no further documents needed.\"}\n\nWait, but the document catalog shows there are other documents. However, the parties are already listed in the complaint. The other documents (like the defendants' answer) might not add new parties. For example, the defendants' answer would list the same parties. So no new values to extract. Therefore, it's safe to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 16 distinct parties (10 plaintiffs, 6 defendants) extracted from the Class Action Complaint; no additional documents required to complete checklist item\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All 16 distinct parties (10 plaintiffs, 6 defendants) extracted from the Class Action Complaint; no additional documents required to complete checklist item", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15796, "completion_tokens": 737, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot. The current task is to extract the parties involved from the legal documents.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already done a lot. Step 1 was listing documents, found 12. Step 2 read the first 10k tokens of the Class Action Complaint. Step 3 appended 16 entries for Who_are_the_Parties, which are all the plaintiffs and defendants listed in that document. Step 4 tried to stop, but the system automatically ran get_checklist and says all 16 values are extracted.\n\nNow, the current status shows that the checklist item \"Who_are_the_Parties\" has 16 values, all extracted from the Class Action Complaint. The document catalog shows that the complaint is partially visited (0-10000 tokens, 52% coverage), but the parties were all mentioned in the first 10k tokens. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist only requires the parties from the documents. Since the complaint already lists all 10 plaintiffs and 6 defendants, there's no need to check other documents. The system's automatic checklist review says 1/1 filled, so all keys are done.\n\nThe user's goal is to extract all applicable checklist items. The only item here is Who_are_the_Parties, which has 16 values. The stop criteria says to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Since all 16 values are extracted with evidence, and no other keys exist, the next step should be to stop again. The system mentioned that this is stop attempt 1/2, so a second stop should be allowed.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that Step 4 called stop, but the system generated a get_checklist. Now the user needs to decide whether to stop again. Since the checklist is fully filled (16 values), and there's no indication of missing entries, the correct action is to stop. The evidence for each party is already appended, so no more actions needed. The other documents aren't relevant because the parties are all in the first complaint. So the next action should be to stop with a reason that all parties are extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 16 distinct parties (10 plaintiffs, 6 defendants) fully extracted from Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief with supporting evidence.
