Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. The checklist item is empty, and all documents are unvisited. The current status shows 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain counsel information. The Complaint usually lists who is representing each party. The Docket might have some info too, but the Complaint is the primary place for that. The Consent Decree and Order might mention counsel, but the Complaint is the best starting point.\n\nThe available documents are all unvisited, so I need to pick one to read. The Complaint is the most relevant. The token count is 3,422, which is under 10,000, so I can read the whole document. Wait, but the system says not to reread, but since it's unvisited, reading the whole thing is okay. But the instructions mention reading a targeted window. However, since it's unvisited, reading the entire document (start_token 0 to 3422) would be efficient here. \n\nWait, the user said \"targeted window (≤10,000 tokens)\", and the document is 3422 tokens, so reading the whole thing is allowed. So the next action should be read_document on Complaint with start_token 0 and end_token 3422. That way, I can get all the text from the Complaint to look for counsel types.\n\nI should check if any other documents might have it, but the Complaint is the primary one. The other documents like Docket or Consent Decree might have it, but starting with Complaint makes sense. So the correct action here is to read the Complaint document in full.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3422}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3422}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3350, "completion_tokens": 399, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that none of the checklist items have values yet. The only document that's been read so far is the Complaint, which is fully visited.\n\nLooking at the Complaint document, I need to check if there's any mention of who is representing each side. The complaint is filed by the United States, so the plaintiff is the U.S. government. The defendants are the City of Durham. \n\nIn the signature block at the end, it lists the attorneys. The counsel for the Plaintiff (United States) are listed as Emily Given, Rebecca A. Mayer, Robert Rich, Karen D. Woodard, Sandra J. Hairston, Kristen Clarke, etc. They're all from the Department of Justice, specifically the Civil Rights Division. So the type of counsel here is \"government counsel\" since it's the U.S. government suing.\n\nFor the defendant, the City of Durham, the complaint doesn't mention their counsel. The document is just the complaint filed by the government, so the defendant's representation isn't specified here. Since the requirement says not to include an entry if the type isn't clear, I shouldn't assume anything about the defendant's counsel from this document.\n\nSo the only clear value from the Complaint is \"government counsel\" for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel isn't mentioned, so no entry for them. \n\nWait, the checklist says to format as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...' if both sides are represented. But since the defendant's side isn't specified here, only the plaintiff's type should be extracted. So the value would be \"government counsel\" for the plaintiff.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are other documents that might have more info. But the current action is to process what's been read. The Complaint has been fully read, and the only counsel mentioned is the government's. So the next step is to append this value to the Type_of_Counsel key.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text. The signature block says \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" followed by the names and their titles. The relevant part is \"United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division\" and the names like \"Assistant Attorney General\" and \"United States Attorney\". So the type is government counsel.\n\nI should structure the evidence with the text snippet, source document, and location. The location would be the signature block, maybe page 10 of the document. The tokens for that part are in the last pages, but the exact token range isn't specified, but the document says it's the Complaint, and the location can be \"Page 10\" as per the document's page numbers.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"government counsel\" with evidence from the signature. Since the checklist item is Type_of_Counsel, and the value is for the plaintiff, but the checklist says to format as 'Plaintiff: ...' if both sides are there. Wait, but here only the plaintiff's counsel is mentioned. The instruction says \"If both sides are represented, extract each as separate values formatted as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'\". Since the defendant's counsel isn't mentioned, only the plaintiff's should be included. So the value would just be \"government counsel\" under Type_of_Counsel, but maybe it's implied as Plaintiff. Wait, the example given in the checklist says \"Plaintiff: ...\", but the actual value should include the side. Wait, the checklist definition says: \"extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\".\n\nWait, looking back at the checklist definition: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nSo for the plaintiff, it should be \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and if defendant had a type, \"Defendant: ...\". But in this case, only plaintiff is mentioned, so the entry should be \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nWait, the example in the checklist says \"e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\" but the instruction says to include the side. So the correct format would have the side prefix. So the value should be \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" as a single string.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Type_of_Counsel\", and the value should be the type, but with the side specified. So the extracted value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nWait, the example given is \"Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\", but the instruction says to format with the side. So the correct value would be \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and \"Defendant: ...\". Since Defendant isn't mentioned, only the Plaintiff part.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nNow, evidence: the text snippet from the signature. The relevant part is:\n\n\"Respectfully submitted,\nKRISTEN CLARKE       SANDRA J.

So the type is government counsel.\n\nThe evidence text should be a snippet, maybe the line \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" and the department. But the exact verbatim text for evidence would be the line where it says \"Counsel for Plaintiff...\".\n\nLocation: Page 10 (as per the document's page numbers).\n\nSource document: Complaint.\n\nSo the evidence entry would have text: \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\", source_document: \"Complaint\", location: \"Page 10\".\n\nThe value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nWait, the example says \"government counsel\" as the type, so the value should be \"government counsel\" but formatted with the side. So the value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nYes, so the extracted value is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nNow, since this is the first entry, and the checklist is empty, I need to append this. Using append_checklist because it's a new value.\n\nSo the patch should have key \"Type_of_Counsel\", and extracted array with one entry: value \"Plaintiff: government counsel\", evidence with the text snippet, source, location.\n\nI need to make sure the evidence has all required fields: text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the tool call will be append_checklist with the patch.\n\nNo other documents have been read yet, but the Complaint is fully visited, so next steps might be to check other documents, but according to the process, after reading the document, I should append the found values. Since I found the value in the Complaint, the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: government counsel\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 10\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: government counsel", "evidence": [{"text": "Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 10"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7050, "completion_tokens": 1786, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. So far, in Step 3, they've already appended \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" from the Complaint document. Now, I need to check if there are more values to extract.\n\nLooking at the current status: only Type_of_Counsel has one value, and all other keys (but there's only one key) are filled. Wait, the checklist has only one item: Type_of_Counsel. The status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so that's the only key. But the problem is, the user mentioned \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", and the current extraction is only for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel might also need to be checked.\n\nIn the Complaint, the plaintiff's counsel is listed as \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" with the attorneys from the Department of Justice. But the defendant's counsel isn't mentioned in the Complaint. The Complaint is filed by the US, so the defendant is the City of Durham. But the Complaint doesn't list the defendant's lawyers. So maybe the defendant's counsel isn't in the Complaint, so I need to check other documents.\n\nThe available documents include Docket, Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion. The Docket might have the defendant's counsel listed. The Docket is unvisited, so I should read that document next. The Docket usually lists all parties and their counsel.\n\nSo the next step should be to read the Docket document to find if the defendant's counsel is mentioned. The Docket is 3,382 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. Since it's unvisited, I'll use read_document on Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 3382.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Documents in Corpus: 6\" and Docket is unvisited. So the correct action is to read the Docket document to check for defendant's counsel. The previous step only got the plaintiff's counsel from the Complaint. The defendant's side might have their own counsel listed in the Docket or another document.

The user is asking to extract the Type_of_Counsel from legal documents. So far, they've already extracted one entry from the Complaint: \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" with evidence from the document.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Checklist Summary shows that Type_of_Counsel has 1 value, and the other keys (if any) are empty. But the task is specifically about Type_of_Counsel. Wait, the checklist only has that one item, right? The user mentioned \"Checklist Items to Extract\" as just Type_of_Counsel.\n\nThe available documents include Docket, which was fully read in Step 4. The Docket has entries like \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" and attorney appearances. Wait, in the Docket, there are entries like:\n\n- \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney REBECCA A. MAYER on behalf of Plaintiff UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\"\n- \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ROBERT RICH on behalf of Plaintiff UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\"\n- \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\"\n- \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney SARAH LAWS on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\"\n\nSo, for the Defendant side, the attorneys are Anne Marie Tosco and Sarah Laws. The document mentions \"on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\". The question is, what type of counsel is that? The Defendant is a city, so their counsel is likely government counsel as well. But wait, the Defendant is the City of Durham, which is a municipal entity. So their counsel would be government counsel, similar to the Plaintiff's side.\n\nThe Plaintiff is the United States, so their counsel is government counsel (from the DOJ). The Defendant, being a city, their counsel would also be government counsel. So for Defendant, it's \"Defendant: government counsel\".\n\nBut the user's requirement says to include specific organizations if available. In the Docket, the attorneys are listed with their names, but not the organization. However, the Complaint's signature block shows \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" with names like Emily Given, Rebecca Mayer, etc., from the DOJ. So for the Plaintiff, it's government counsel (USDOJ). For the Defendant, the attorneys are from the city's legal department, so also government counsel.\n\nWait, but the Defendant's counsel isn't specified as \"government counsel\" in the Docket. The Docket entries just say \"on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM\", so we have to infer the type. Since the Defendant is a city, their counsel would be municipal government counsel, which falls under \"government counsel\" as per the checklist's example.\n\nSo, the Defendant's counsel type should be \"Defendant: government counsel\". The Plaintiff's is already extracted as \"Plaintiff: government counsel\".\n\nWait, but the current extracted value is only \"Plaintiff: government counsel\". The Defendant's side hasn't been extracted yet. So we need to check the Docket again for Defendant's counsel type.\n\nIn the Docket, entries 6 and 8 mention \"on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM\" with attorneys Tosco and Laws. Since the Defendant is a city, their counsel is government counsel. So the value should be \"Defendant: government counsel\".\n\nBut the Docket doesn't explicitly say \"government counsel\", so we have to use the context. The Plaintiff is the US government, so their counsel is government counsel. The Defendant is a city, so their counsel is also government counsel. The checklist says to use \"government counsel\" for such cases.\n\nSo, the next step is to extract \"Defendant: government counsel\" from the Docket entries. The evidence would be the Docket entries where attorneys appear for the Defendant.\n\nLooking at the Docket text, entry 6: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\". Similarly, entry 8: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney SARAH LAWS on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\".\n\nSo, the type of counsel for Defendant is government counsel. Therefore, we need to append this value to Type_of_Counsel.\n\nThe current extracted value is only for Plaintiff. We need to add the Defendant's side.\n\nSo the next action should be to append the Defendant's counsel type. But the Docket was fully read (marked as ✓ Fully Visited), so we can use the existing text. However, the user has to make sure that the evidence is correctly cited.\n\nWait, the Docket was read in Step 4, and the text is provided. The assistant should analyze that text to extract the Defendant's counsel type.\n\nThe checklist requires extracting each side as separate values. So \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\".\n\nSince the Defendant's counsel is from the city's legal department (government), it's \"government counsel\". So the new entry would be \"Defendant: government counsel\" with evidence from the Docket entries.\n\nThe existing extracted value is for Plaintiff. Now, we need to append the Defendant's value.\n\nSo the next action should be `append_checklist` with the new entry for Defendant.\n\nWait, but the user's current step is after Step 4, which read the Docket. The Docket text is provided, and the assistant needs to process it. The previous step was `read_document` on Docket, so the next step is to append the extracted values from that read.\n\nIn the Docket text, we have two attorney appearances for the Defendant. So the Type_of_Counsel should have two entries: one for Plaintiff and one for Defendant.\n\nBut the current checklist has only 1 value (Plaintiff). So the missing value is Defendant: government counsel.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call `append_checklist` with the new entry.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: need to include verbatim text, source document, location.\n\nFor the Defendant entry, the evidence would be the Docket entries mentioning the attorneys for the Defendant. The location could be the Docket entries 6 and 8.\n\nSo the extracted value would be:\n\n- Value: \"Defendant: government counsel\"\n- Evidence: \n  - text: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\"\n  - source_document: \"Docket\"\n  - location: \"Docket entry 6\"\n  - and another evidence entry for Sarah Laws (Docket entry 8), but since the type is the same, maybe just one evidence entry is sufficient, but the requirement says \"each unique value\" with evidence. Wait, the value is the same for both attorneys, so it's the same value, so we can have one evidence entry citing both entries, or list both as separate evidence. But the checklist says \"each unique value\", so the value \"Defendant: government counsel\" is unique, so one entry with multiple evidence snippets.\n\nBut according to the evidence requirements, each extracted value must have evidence. So for the value \"Defendant: government counsel\", the evidence can include both Docket entries 6 and 8.\n\nSo the evidence array would have two entries, each with the text, source, location.\n\nBut the `append_checklist` function allows multiple evidence entries per value.\n\nSo the `append_checklist` call should have:\n\npatch: [\n  {\n    key: \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n    extracted: [\n      {\n        value: \"Defendant: government counsel\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\",\n            source_document: \"Docket\",\n            location: \"Docket entry 6\"\n          },\n          {\n            text: \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney SARAH LAWS on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\",\n            source_document: \"Docket\",\n            location: \"Docket entry 8\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nWait, but the current checklist already has the Plaintiff's entry. So appending the Defendant's entry.\n\nThe existing entry is \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" from the Complaint. Now adding \"Defendant: government counsel\" from the Docket.\n\nSo the next action is `append_checklist` with the new value.\n\nThe other documents (Consent Decree, Order, etc.) are unvisited, but since the Defendant's counsel is already covered in the Docket, which is fully visited, there's no need to read other documents. The Docket has the necessary info.\n\nSo the correct action is to append the Defendant's counsel type.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Defendant: government counsel\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket entry 6\"}, {\"text\": \"NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney SARAH LAWS on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket entry 8\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Defendant: government counsel", "evidence": [{"text": "NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney ANNE MARIE TOSCO on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket entry 6"}, {"text": "NOTICE of Attorney Appearance by attorney SARAH LAWS on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket entry 8"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10647, "completion_tokens": 2005, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. So far, they've already processed the Complaint and Docket documents. From the Complaint, they found \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" because the attorneys listed were from the U.S. Department of Justice. From the Docket, they found \"Defendant: government counsel\" because the attorneys for the Defendant (City of Durham) were listed as appearing on behalf of the city, which is a government entity.\n\nNow, the available documents include Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion. But the Checklist Item says to extract \"the type of counsel representing each side\" using categories like private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, etc. The Defendant here is a city, so their counsel is likely government counsel as well. But I need to check if there's any other type mentioned in the remaining documents.\n\nWait, the current status shows that Type_of_Counsel has two values: one for Plaintiff and one for Defendant. The Plaintiff's counsel is government (from DOJ), and Defendant's counsel is government (since the City of Durham is a government entity, and their attorneys are appearing on behalf of the city). So maybe there's no need to check other documents because the Defendant's counsel is already identified as government counsel. But let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, entries 6 and 8 show attorney appearances for the Defendant (City of Durham) by Anne Marie Tosco and Sarah Laws. The notice says \"on behalf of Defendant CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\". Since the Defendant is a city government, their counsel is government counsel. So the extracted value \"Defendant: government counsel\" is correct.\n\nThe remaining documents (Consent Decree, Order, etc.) might have more details, but the checklist item is about the type of counsel, not additional details. The key is to check if there's any other type of counsel mentioned. For example, if the Defendant had private counsel, but in this case, it's a government entity, so their counsel would be government. The Docket entries for the Defendant's attorneys don't indicate they're private; they're listed as appearing on behalf of the city, which is a government body. So the Type_of_Counsel for Defendant is correctly noted as government counsel.\n\nWait, but the user's previous actions have already appended two values: Plaintiff: government counsel and Defendant: government counsel. The current checklist summary shows 2 values, which matches the extracted ones. The remaining documents might not add any new types. For instance, the Consent Decree might be a settlement document, but it's likely that the counsel types are the same as before. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might not mention counsel types either.\n\nThe system's next step should be to verify if all necessary values are extracted. Since the Plaintiff and Defendant's counsel types are both government, and the documents already show that, there's no need to read more documents. The checklist item should have two entries: one for Plaintiff, one for Defendant, both \"government counsel\". The current extracted values are correct.\n\nWait, but the user's step 5 already appended the Defendant's values. So the checklist should be complete. The next step would be to check if there are any other keys, but the checklist item is only Type_of_Counsel. Since the status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and all values are extracted, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The two values are already there. The Defendant's counsel is government counsel, same as Plaintiff. So no more values to extract. The Not Applicable is 0, so they don't need to set that.

The user wants me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. From the prior steps, they've already extracted two entries: one from the Complaint and one from the Docket. The Complaint mentioned \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and the Docket had \"Defendant: government counsel\" from the attorney appearances.\n\nNow, looking at the current status, all documents except Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion are fully visited. The checklist shows that Type_of_Counsel has two values, and the system says it's filled. The user tried to stop at step 6, but the system required a second stop attempt.\n\nWait, the available documents include Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion, which are unvisited. But the checklist item \"Type_of_Counsel\" only needs to be extracted from documents where the counsel type is clear. The prior steps already got both plaintiff and defendant's counsel as government counsel. The other documents might not add new counsel types. For example, the Joint Motion mentions \"AUSA Rebecca Mayer\" which is still government counsel, so it's redundant. The Consent Decree and Notice of Dismissal probably don't mention counsel types beyond what's already in the Complaint and Docket.\n\nThe system's automatic review after the first stop says all keys are filled. The checklist status is 1/1 filled. So there's no need to read more documents because the existing entries cover both sides (plaintiff and defendant) as government counsel. The requirement was to extract every distinct value, and they have two entries: one for plaintiff, one for defendant. No other counsel types are present in the visited documents, and the unvisited ones likely don't add new info. For instance, the Joint Motion's \"AUSA\" is part of government counsel, so it's the same category. The Amicus briefs (American Alliance for Equal Rights) are amici, not parties, so they don't count for Type_of_Counsel as per the checklist definition (only for the parties, plaintiff and defendant).\n\nSo, the next action should be to stop again, since all required values are extracted. The prior stop was rejected because it's the first attempt, but the system allows a second stop. The reason would be that both sides' counsel types are already covered, and no additional values are present in the corpus.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All Type_of_Counsel values (Plaintiff: government counsel, Defendant: government counsel) are fully extracted with evidence from fully visited documents (Complaint and Docket).
