Case codes are likely in the Docket or maybe the Complaint. The Docket might have references to related cases. The Consent Decree and other orders might also mention related cases.\n\nSince the documents are all unvisited, I should start by reading one of them. The Docket is a good candidate because dockets often list related cases. The Docket document has 3,382 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. But maybe the case numbers are in a specific section. However, without knowing where, reading the whole document is safe here.\n\nWait, the system says not to read fully visited documents, but all are unvisited. So reading the entire Docket is okay. Let me choose `read_document` for the Docket. The start and end tokens should be 0 to the full token count. The Docket has 3,382 tokens, so start_token 0, end_token 3382.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Docket document to look for case codes.

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The Docket document was fully read (tokens 0-3382), but the extraction hasn't found any related cases yet. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion.\n\nLooking at the Docket entry, there's a mention of \"Exhibit 4 - Lubbock Order\" and \"Exhibit 5 - Austin Order\" in document 20. Also, \"Exhibit 9 - Lubbock Decree\" and \"Exhibit 10 - Austin Decree\" in document 22. These might refer to related cases, but the actual case codes aren't provided here. The Docket itself lists the current case as being against the City of Durham, but no other case numbers.\n\nSince the Docket was fully read and no case codes were found, the next step is to check other documents. The Joint Motion for Provisional Approval (document 2) mentions \"Exhibit A - Consent Decree\" and attachments. The Consent Decree document might contain related case references. The Consent Decree is a big document (21k tokens), so I should read it to look for case numbers.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Consent Decree as \"Consent Decree [Order/Opinion] - 21,015 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". Since it's unvisited, I should read it. But maybe a regex search would be more efficient. The checklist item is about case code numbers, so the pattern might be something like \"Case No.\" or \"Case Number\" followed by a code.\n\nLooking at the Docket, there are entries like \"Exhibit 4 - Lubbock Order\" which refers to another case, but the actual case number isn't there. The related cases might be mentioned in the Consent Decree or other documents. The Consent Decree document is likely to have references to other cases, especially since it's a consent decree related to other cases (like Lubbock, Austin, etc.).\n\nSo, the best next action is to search for case codes using a regex pattern. The pattern could be something like \"Case No.\\s*[A-Z0-9]+\", but since the exact format isn't known, maybe a broader pattern like \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" to catch variations. However, the instructions say to use precise patterns. Alternatively, since the Docket mentions \"Lubbock Order\" and \"Austin Order\", maybe the related cases are named after cities, but the case codes might be different.\n\nWait, the requirement is to extract the case code numbers, not the city names. So, the actual case numbers (like \"1:23-cv-00123\") might be in the documents. The Consent Decree might list other cases with their numbers. So, searching for patterns like \"Case No.: [0-9]+\", \"Case No. [0-9]+\", or \"Case No. [A-Z0-9]+-\".\n\nGiven that, using `search_document_regex` with a pattern to find case numbers. The pattern should be \"Case No[.:]?\\s*([A-Z0-9\\-]+)\" to capture the code. But the parameters need to specify the pattern. Let's use \"Case No[.:]?\\s*([A-Z0-9\\-]+)\" as the pattern. Since the Consent Decree is the most likely to contain such references, but the search can be applied to all documents. Wait, the available documents include the Consent Decree, which is a big document, so searching all documents might be efficient.\n\nWait, the Docket was already read and didn't have the case codes. The next step is to search all documents for case numbers. The tool `search_document_regex` can search all documents with `doc_name='all'` and the pattern. The top_k can be 5, context_tokens 200. Let's set pattern to \"Case No[.:]?\\s*([A-Z0-9\\-]+)\" to capture the code.\n\nAlternatively, since the Docket mentions \"Exhibit 4 - Lubbock Order\" and \"Exhibit 5 - Austin Order\", maybe the related cases are Lubbock and Austin cases, but the actual case numbers might be in those exhibits. However, without the exhibits being read, it's hard to know. The Consent Decree document might reference other case numbers directly.\n\nSo, using `search_document_regex` on all documents to find any mention of case numbers. The pattern should be broad enough to catch different formats but precise. Let's go with \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\". The regex flags can be IGNORECASE to catch variations.\n\nWait, the pattern should be a regex. Let's use \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\". The search should return matches with context. Then, once the matches are found, we can read the specific parts to confirm the case numbers.\n\nYes, that's the right approach. So the next action is to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Case No[.:]?\\\\s*[A-Z0-9\\\\-]+\" and `doc_name='all'`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Case No[.:]?\\\\s*[A-Z0-9\\\\-]+\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6790, "completion_tokens": 1215, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents. The checklist item requires all distinct case code numbers mentioned in any document.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The snapshot shows that the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" key is empty, and there are 6 documents in total. The Docket document has been fully read (3,382 tokens, 100% coverage), and the other documents are partially visited or unvisited.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 2 read the Docket (tokens 0-3382), and Step 3 used `search_document_regex` on all documents with the pattern \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" which found three matches. Each match was in the Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and Joint Motion documents. The pattern found \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" in each of those documents.\n\nWait, the regex search found \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" in three documents. But the key is to extract the case code numbers. So the value here is \"24-cv-838\". Each of the three documents (Order, Notice, Joint Motion) mentions the same case number. So the distinct value is \"24-cv-838\".\n\nNow, the current status shows that the key is empty. The regex search found the case number, but the system hasn't processed it yet. The next step is to append this value to the checklist. Since the regex found the matches, and the evidence is in those documents, I need to use `append_checklist` to add the extracted value.\n\nEach match in the regex search provides evidence. For example, in the Joint Motion document, the case number is in the header. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The regex search showed the tokens for each match, so I can use those.\n\nThe three matches all point to the same case number, so it's a single distinct value. The evidence would be from each document where it's found, but since it's the same value, we can list all three as evidence. However, the requirement says \"distinct values\", so even though it's mentioned in multiple documents, it's one value. But the evidence should include all instances where it's mentioned.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so \"24-cv-838\" is the only distinct value. Each document's match contributes to the evidence. So for the extracted value \"24-cv-838\", the evidence should include the text snippets from all three documents where it appears.\n\nBut the `append_checklist` allows adding multiple evidence entries per value. So for the key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", the extracted value is [\"24-cv-838\"], and the evidence would have three entries: one from each document (Order, Notice, Joint Motion).\n\nWait, but the value is the same, so it's one value with multiple evidence entries. The `extracted` field in the checklist entry should have the value once, but with multiple evidence items. Wait, no. The `extracted` array in the patch for a key can have multiple entries. Each entry is a separate extracted value. But since the value is the same, maybe it's better to have one entry with multiple evidence items.\n\nLooking at the evidence requirements: each extracted entry must have evidence. So for the value \"24-cv-838\", we can have one entry with three evidence items (from each document). Or, since it's the same value, one evidence entry per document. Wait, the instructions say \"Create separate entries for each unique value\". Since the value is the same, it's one unique value, but it's mentioned in multiple documents, so we need to include all evidence sources.\n\nThe correct approach is to have one entry for \"24-cv-838\" with multiple evidence entries (each from a different document). Each evidence entry has the text, source_document, and location.\n\nSo the `extracted` array for the key would be:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"value\": \"24-cv-838\",\n    \"evidence\": [\n      { \"text\": \"Case No.  24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-135\" },\n      { \"text\": \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-139\" },\n      { \"text\": \"Case No.  24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-131\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nBut wait, the `append_checklist` appends to the existing list. Since the key is currently empty, appending this single entry (with three evidence items) would set it. However, the `extracted` field for a key in the checklist is a list of entries. Each entry is a value with evidence. So for a single value that appears in multiple documents, you can have one entry with multiple evidence items.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the `append_checklist` should be used to add this entry.\n\nNow, checking the available documents: the three documents where the regex found matches are partially visited. The Order has been viewed up to token 131, which covers the match. The Notice and Joint Motion are partially visited, but the regex matches were found in the first 135 tokens for Joint Motion and 139 for Notice, which are within the viewed tokens. Wait, the \"Viewed tokens\" for Order is 0-131, which covers the match. Similarly, the Joint Motion's viewed tokens are 0-135, which matches the regex's token range. The Notice is 0-139, which covers its match. So the text is already available, no need to read further.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to `append_checklist` with the extracted value and evidence from the three documents.\n\nWait, but the recent action was `search_document_regex` which returned the matches, so the evidence is already available. The system should use that to append the checklist entry.\n\nSo the correct action is `append_checklist` with the patch containing the key and the extracted entry.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"24-cv-838\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case No.  24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-135\"}, {\"text\": \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-139\"}, {\"text\": \"Case No.  24-cv-838\", \"source_document\": \"Order\", \"location\": \"tokens 0-131\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "24-cv-838", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No.  24-cv-838", "source_document": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "location": "tokens 0-135"}, {"text": "Case No. 1:24-cv-838", "source_document": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "tokens 0-139"}, {"text": "Case No.  24-cv-838", "source_document": "Order", "location": "tokens 0-131"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7413, "completion_tokens": 1599, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already found one value: \"24-cv-838\" from three different documents. But wait, the evidence shows three entries but the value is the same case number. The task says to extract EVERY distinct value. So even though it's the same number from multiple documents, it's still just one distinct value. So the extracted list should have \"24-cv-838\" once, but with three pieces of evidence from different documents.\n\nWait, the step 4 says they appended the value with three evidence entries. But the requirement is to have separate entries for each unique value. Since it's the same value, it should be one entry with multiple evidence sources. However, the checklist item can have multiple values, but in this case, all are the same. So the correct way is to have one entry with three evidence sources. But the previous action used append_checklist with three evidence entries for the same value. Wait, no, the append_checklist was used to add three evidence entries for the same value. But according to the instructions, each extracted value should be a separate entry. Wait, the problem says \"Create separate entries for each unique value\". So if the value is the same, they shouldn't be separate entries. So maybe the previous append was incorrect. But the user's step 4 shows that they appended the same value three times. However, the checklist item should have the value once, but with multiple evidence sources. But the system's evidence requires each value entry to have its own evidence. Hmm, maybe the correct approach is to have one entry with all three evidence sources. But the append_checklist allows adding multiple entries for the same key. So perhaps the assistant added three entries, each with the same value but different evidence. But the requirement says \"distinct values\", so if the value is the same, it's not distinct. So maybe they should have one entry with three evidence items. Wait, the evidence for each value should be separate. Wait, no. Each value entry (i.e., each occurrence of the case number) should have its own evidence. But since it's the same case number, it's the same value. So the correct way is to have one entry with three evidence entries. But the append_checklist is appending three entries, each with the same value but different evidence. That's acceptable because the value is the same, but the evidence is different. So the checklist would have one value with three evidence sources. Wait, but the problem says \"EVERY distinct value\". So \"24-cv-838\" is one distinct value, so it should be listed once, but with all the evidence supporting it. However, the current system's evidence requires each extracted entry to have its own evidence. So the way it's set up, each evidence is part of the same value entry. Wait, looking at the evidence structure: for each value, the evidence is an array of evidence items. So for the value \"24-cv-838\", the evidence array would have three entries (from the three documents). So the previous append_checklist was correct in adding three evidence items under the same value.\n\nBut the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 1\", which matches one distinct value. So the extraction is correct.\n\nNow, the next step. The available documents include \"Complaint\" and \"Consent Decree\" which are unvisited. The other documents have been partially visited. The task is to extract all related cases. The current value is \"24-cv-838\", but maybe there are other case numbers in the unvisited documents.\n\nCheck the documents:\n\n- Complaint: 3,422 tokens, unvisited. The complaint might have a case number. The previous documents (Joint Motion, Notice, Order) all have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\", so the complaint probably has the same. But maybe there's another case.\n\n- Consent Decree: 21,015 tokens, unvisited. The Consent Decree document might reference other cases. For example, in the Joint Motion, there's a reference to \"Exhibit 1 - Scherbaum Declaration\" and other exhibits like \"Lubbock Decree\", \"Austin Decree\", etc. But the checklist is about \"Related Cases Listed by Their Case Code Number\". The case code numbers would be like \"24-cv-838\", but the exhibits might have their own case numbers. However, the exhibits are part of the document, so maybe the Consent Decree document has references to other case numbers.\n\nWait, the Joint Motion mentions \"Exhibit 1 - Scherbaum Declaration\", \"Exhibit 2 - Goldstein Declaration\", etc. But the checklist item is for the case code number, not the exhibit names. The case code number is the main case's number, which is 24-cv-838. However, the Consent Decree document might list other cases as related. For example, in the Consent Decree, it might reference other cases, like \"Lubbock v. City of Lubbock\" which might have a case number.\n\nLooking at the previous search with regex \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", they found three matches in three documents. But maybe in the Consent Decree, there's another case number. The Consent Decree is a large document (21k tokens), so it's possible.\n\nThe current action should be to read the unvisited documents to check for more case numbers. The available unvisited documents are Complaint and Consent Decree. The Complaint is likely to have the same case number, so probably no new distinct value. But the Consent Decree might have references to other cases.\n\nThe next logical step is to read the Consent Decree document to check for any case numbers. Since it's unvisited, we need to read it. The Consent Decree is 21k tokens, but the maximum per read_document is 10k tokens. So we can read the first 10k tokens. But the document is large, so maybe read the first part to see if there's a case number.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex on the Consent Decree document for case numbers. But the previous regex search was done on all documents, and it found three matches. The Consent Decree might have more matches, but since it's unvisited, the previous search might not have covered it. Wait, the step 3 says \"search_document_regex on all documents\" and found 3 matches. But the Consent Decree was not visited, so the regex search probably scanned all documents, including the unvisited ones. Wait, the search_document_regex function can search all documents, even if they're unvisited. So the previous search should have found all matches in all documents. But the search found 3 matches, all in the three documents that were partially visited (Joint Motion, Notice, Order). The Consent Decree and Complaint weren't searched because the regex was run on all documents, but maybe the Consent Decree wasn't searched because it's unvisited? Wait, the search_document_regex function says \"searches documents using a regex pattern\" and the parameters include \"doc_name\" or \"doc_names\". In step 3, they used \"doc_name='all'\", so it should have searched all 6 documents. But the search result says \"3 total matches\" in three documents. So the Consent Decree and Complaint might not have any case numbers matching the pattern. But the Complaint might have the case number. Wait, the Complaint is a document, so it's possible that it has \"Case No. 24-cv-838\", but the regex search would have found it. Since the regex search found 3 matches, and the Complaint is unvisited, maybe the regex search did find it but the user didn't mention it. Wait, the search result says \"3 total matches\" in three documents: Joint Motion, Notice, Order. So the Complaint and Consent Decree didn't have any matches. Therefore, the only case number is 24-cv-838.\n\nBut wait, the Consent Decree might have other case numbers in its content. For example, the exhibits mentioned in the Joint Motion (like Lubbock Decree) might have their own case numbers. The Consent Decree document might reference those, so maybe there's a \"Case No. 1:18-cv-00000\" or something. However, the regex pattern used was \"Case No[.:]?\\s*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\", which would match \"Case No. 1:18-cv-00000\". So if the Consent Decree has such a reference, the regex would have found it. But the previous search didn't find any matches in Consent Decree or Complaint, so perhaps there are no other case numbers.\n\nWait, the Consent Decree is a document that's part of the case, so it's likely that it refers to the main case's number, but maybe not other cases. The exhibits in the Joint Motion (like \"Lubbock Decree\") might have their own case numbers, but the Consent Decree document itself might not list them as \"Case No.\" but as part of the exhibit titles. For example, \"Lubbock Decree\" might be the title, but the actual case number is in the exhibit. However, the Consent Decree document might not contain the case numbers for those exhibits. So the regex search might not have found them.\n\nBut according to the previous search, there were only three matches, all in the three documents. So maybe there are no other case numbers. Therefore, the only value is 24-cv-838.\n\nNow, the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 1\", and all keys are filled. So the checklist item is complete. The next step would be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user needs to confirm that there are no more values. The Complaint and Consent Decree are unvisited, but the regex search was done on all documents, so it should have covered them. Since the regex search found only three matches, and they're all accounted for, there are no more case numbers to extract. Therefore, the checklist is complete.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct case code values ('24-cv-838') have been extracted from all relevant documents with supporting evidence.

The system says all distinct values have been found, and the regex search only found that one case number.

The unvisited documents (Complaint and Consent Decree) might not have the case number again, but maybe they should be checked. However, the regex search already covered all documents and only found \"24-cv-838\" in those three. The Complaint document hasn't been read yet, but the regex would have searched it.
