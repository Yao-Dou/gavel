The user needs to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from legal documents. The checklist item is specific: only the non-court-ordered settlement terms, not those in consent decrees or orders.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents. There's a Consent Decree and an Order, which are court-ordered, so probably not where the settlement terms are. The Settlement Terms are likely in the Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree. Wait, the document name is \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\". Hmm, but the motion might include the settlement terms before they're turned into an order.\n\nWait, the checklist says not to include terms that are in court orders. So the actual settlement terms would be in the motion, not in the Consent Decree or Order. The Consent Decree is the court order, so that's where terms are incorporated. The Joint Motion might outline the terms that are being proposed for the consent decree. So the settlement terms (non-court-ordered) would be in the Joint Motion.\n\nAlso, there's a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, but that's probably about dismissing the case, not settlement terms. Complaint and Docket might not have the terms either. The Order is too short (387 tokens), so maybe not.\n\nThe user's previous step was list_documents, which found 6 documents. Now, need to read the relevant document. The Joint Motion for Provisional Approval is a Pleading/Motion, which is likely where the settlement terms are discussed. So, I should read that document.\n\nCheck the token count: 1,149 tokens, which is under 10k. So read_document on that document. Since it's unvisited, start from token 0 to end. But the document is small, so read the whole thing.\n\nWait, the document is \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\". The motion would state the terms of the settlement that the parties are proposing, which would be the significant terms before they become part of the court order. So that's the right document to read.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\", start_token 0, end_token 1149 (since it's 1149 tokens total). That way, we get the full text to look for the settlement terms.\n\nNo need for regex here because the document name suggests it's the right one, and the terms are likely in the body of the motion. So using read_document is better than search_document_regex. The checklist item is specific, so reading the document directly makes sense.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1149}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1149}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3359, "completion_tokens": 612, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" from the documents, but I have to be careful about what counts as a settlement term versus court-ordered terms.\n\nLooking at the current status: the only document read so far is the \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\" (tokens 0-1149). The checklist item is empty, and all other documents are unvisited. The key instruction says not to include terms that are part of a court order (like consent decrees), so I need to check if this motion document actually contains settlement terms or if it's just about getting the consent decree approved.\n\nScanning the read document... Hmm, the motion mentions \"the attached Consent Decree\" but doesn't list any specific settlement terms. It's just a motion asking the court to approve the decree. The actual terms would likely be in the Consent Decree document itself, which is marked as unvisited (○ Unvisited) with 21,015 tokens. \n\nThe user's requirement is clear: extract only non-court-ordered settlement terms. Since this motion is about a consent decree (which is court-ordered), it probably doesn't contain the actual settlement terms. The real terms would be in the Consent Decree document. So I shouldn't extract anything from this motion.\n\nNext step: I should move to the Consent Decree document because that's where the actual settlement terms would be listed. The document is unvisited, so I'll use read_document to access it. But wait - the Consent Decree is a large document (21k tokens), so I need to read a targeted window. Since the user hasn't specified where to look, I'll start from the beginning (tokens 0-10000) to cover the main content.\n\nWait, but the document catalog shows \"Consent Decree\" as [Order/Opinion], which might mean it's a court order. But the checklist definition says \"not entered as a court order\" - so if this is a consent decree (which is a court order), then it shouldn't be used for settlement terms. Oh no, this is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the checklist definition: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So the Consent Decree document itself is a court order, so its terms are excluded. But the motion mentions \"attached Consent Decree\" - meaning the actual settlement terms might be in the motion or another document.\n\nWait, the motion says \"the attached Consent Decree resolving this litigation\" - so the consent decree is the court order. But the settlement terms that are not court-ordered... where would those be? Maybe in a separate settlement agreement that's not filed as a court order. But the available documents don't include a \"Settlement Agreement\" - only \"Consent Decree\" (which is an order).\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe there is no non-court-ordered settlement terms here, so I should set it to Not Applicable. But I need to confirm by checking the Consent Decree document to see if it contains any terms that aren't court-ordered. But according to the definition, the Consent Decree is a court order, so all its terms are excluded.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"a settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" So if the Consent Decree is entered as an order, then the settlement terms within it are excluded. But the motion is for provisional approval of the Consent Decree, meaning the terms are part of the order.\n\nSo probably, there are no non-court-ordered settlement terms to extract. But I need to verify by checking the Consent Decree document to see if it contains any settlement terms that might not be court-ordered. Wait, no - the Consent Decree is a court order, so all terms in it are court-ordered. Therefore, the Significant_Terms_of_Settlement should be \"Not Applicable\".\n\nBut I should confirm by reading the Consent Decree document to ensure there's no separate settlement agreement. The document catalog shows \"Consent Decree\" as a separate document from the motion. If I read it and see it's a court order, then I can set it to Not Applicable.\n\nSo my next action should be to read the Consent Decree document. Since it's unvisited, I'll use read_document on it. Start from tokens 0-10000 to cover the beginning where the terms would likely be.\n\nWait, but the user said \"Do not include any terms the court ordered\", and the Consent Decree is a court order, so any terms in it are excluded. So if I read it and see it's a consent decree, then there are no terms to extract. But I need to confirm it's indeed a court order. The document name is \"Consent Decree\", which is a type of court order.\n\nSo maybe I should set it to Not Applicable after confirming. But to be thorough, I should read the Consent Decree document to check for any non-court-ordered terms. However, the name \"Consent Decree\" strongly suggests it's a court order. But I shouldn't assume - I need to verify.\n\nTherefore, the correct next step is to read the Consent Decree document to confirm its content. So I'll call read_document on \"Consent Decree\" from tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Consent Decree\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Consent Decree", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4651, "completion_tokens": 1199, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item specifies that they should extract substantive obligations from a settlement that's not entered as a court order.

But the Joint Motion mentions a \"Consent Decree,\" which is a court order, so the actual settlement terms might be in the motion or other documents.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 listed documents, Step 2 read the Joint Motion (which is about entering a Consent Decree), and Step 3 read the Consent Decree (which is the court order itself). The Consent Decree is an order, so the terms within it are court-ordered, not settlement terms. The user needs to find the actual settlement terms, which would be in the Joint Motion or other documents.\n\nWait, the Joint Motion says \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree.\" The motion is asking the court to approve the Consent Decree. The actual settlement terms would be in the Consent Decree, but the problem states not to include terms that are court-ordered. Wait, but the Consent Decree is the court order, so all terms in it are court-ordered. Therefore, the settlement terms (the agreement between the parties before court approval) might be in the Joint Motion or another document.\n\nThe Joint Motion document (Step 2) was read, but it's just a motion to approve the decree. It doesn't list the terms. The Consent Decree (Step 3) was read up to 10,000 tokens, which includes the full terms. But since the Consent Decree is a court order, the terms within it are not to be extracted. However, the problem says \"a settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" Wait, the Consent Decree is the court order, so the settlement terms are the ones that were agreed upon before the court entered the order. So the actual settlement terms would be in the agreement between the parties, which is the Consent Decree, but the Consent Decree itself is the court order. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the Consent Decree is the document that the parties agree to, and then the court enters it as an order. So the terms in the Consent Decree are the settlement terms, but since the court has entered it as an order, those terms are not to be extracted. The problem says \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So the Consent Decree terms are court-ordered, so they shouldn't be extracted. Therefore, the actual settlement terms (the agreement before court approval) might be in the Joint Motion or another document, but the Joint Motion just refers to the Consent Decree. The Complaint might have some terms, but it's a complaint, not the settlement.\n\nWait, the user's checklist says \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" are the substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. So if the settlement is later entered as a court order (like a consent decree), then those terms are court-ordered and shouldn't be included. Therefore, the actual settlement terms (the agreement) would be in the document that's the settlement agreement, but in this case, the settlement agreement is the Consent Decree, which is then entered as a court order. So there's no settlement terms outside of the court order here. Therefore, there are no terms to extract because all terms are part of the court order.\n\nBut the user needs to check if there's any non-court-ordered settlement terms. The Consent Decree is the court order, so any terms within it are excluded. The Joint Motion is just a motion to get the court to approve it, so it doesn't contain the settlement terms. The other documents (Complaint, Docket, Order, Notice) might not contain settlement terms. The Complaint is the lawsuit, so it's about the allegations, not the settlement. The Docket is a record of court filings. The Order might be a court order, but it's listed as 387 tokens, unvisited. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might not relate to settlement terms.\n\nWait, but the Consent Decree is the settlement agreement that's being entered as an order. So the terms inside the Consent Decree are the settlement terms, but since they are being entered as a court order, they are excluded from the checklist. Therefore, there are no applicable terms to extract, so the checklist item should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if there's any other document that has the settlement terms not in the court order. The Joint Motion refers to the Consent Decree as the settlement, so the actual terms are in the Consent Decree. Since the Consent Decree is a court order, the terms are excluded. Therefore, the checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" should be set to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement.\" So if the settlement is entered as an order (like a consent decree), then it's not considered a settlement for the purpose of this checklist. Therefore, the terms in the consent decree (which is entered as an order) are excluded. So the checklist item has no applicable values, so it's Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next step is to use `update_checklist` to set \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" to Not Applicable, with evidence. The evidence would be that the Consent Decree is a court order (as per the document's title and content), so the terms within it are court-ordered and excluded.\n\nLooking at the Consent Decree document's title: \"CONSENT DECREE\" and it's filed as a document in court. The Joint Motion is for entry of the Consent Decree, so the Consent Decree is the court order. Therefore, the terms are court-ordered, so the checklist item should be Not Applicable.\n\nSo the correct action is to call `update_checklist` with the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" and value \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the Consent Decree's title and description.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"CONSENT DECREE\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Consent Decree\",\n                \"location\": \"Document Title\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"JOINT MOTION FOR PROVISIONAL APPROVAL AND ENTRY OF CONSENT DECREE\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\",\n                \"location\": \"Document Title\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"the Court enters the Decree as a final order\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Consent Decree\",\n                \"location\": \"Paragraph 32\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "CONSENT DECREE", "source_document": "Consent Decree", "location": "Document Title"}, {"text": "JOINT MOTION FOR PROVISIONAL APPROVAL AND ENTRY OF CONSENT DECREE", "source_document": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "location": "Document Title"}, {"text": "the Court enters the Decree as a final order", "source_document": "Consent Decree", "location": "Paragraph 32"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15344, "completion_tokens": 1551, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
