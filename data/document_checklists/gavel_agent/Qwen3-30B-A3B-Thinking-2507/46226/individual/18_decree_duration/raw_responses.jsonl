So the correct action here is to list the documents to find out what's available.\n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The system says to use `list_documents` when the catalog is unknown.

The user needs to extract the decree duration from the legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" item. The checklist says to extract every distinct value, each as a separate entry with evidence.\n\nFirst, I check the current status. The snapshot shows that there are 6 documents, all unvisited. The key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty. The documents include things like Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and a Joint Motion. \n\nSince the Consent Decree document is named \"Consent Decree\" and it's an Order/Opinion with 21k tokens, that's probably where the decree duration would be mentioned. The other documents might not have the decree details. The Docket might have a summary, but the actual decree is likely in the Consent Decree document.\n\nThe user's goal is to find the duration. The checklist specifies it's for court-ordered decrees, not just agreements. So the Consent Decree document is the most likely place. Since all documents are unvisited, I should start by reading the Consent Decree. The document is 21k tokens, so I need to read it in chunks, but the first step is to read a portion. The max per read is 10k tokens, so I'll start from the beginning.\n\nI should use read_document for the Consent Decree, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000. That's the most efficient way to get the initial text. The other documents might not have the info, so focusing on the most relevant one first makes sense. The Joint Motion mentions a consent decree, but the actual decree text is probably in the Consent Decree document.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Consent Decree\" from 0 to 10,000 tokens. That's the first step to get the content where the duration might be listed.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Consent Decree\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Consent Decree", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3324, "completion_tokens": 461, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and the requirement is to find the duration of the decree obligations as ordered by the court.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. They read the Consent Decree document from tokens 0-10000. The provided text is the beginning of the Consent Decree. I need to look for sections that mention the duration of the decree.\n\nLooking through the document, I see Section XI is titled \"DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE\". That's probably where the duration is specified. Let me scan for that section.\n\nIn the text, after Section X (Dispute Resolution) and before Section XII (Costs and Fees), there's a section XI. The user provided up to page 24, but the actual text for Section XI might be in the next pages. Wait, the document shows up to page 24 (tokens 0-10000), but the Consent Decree's Section XI might not be fully covered yet. Let me check the provided text.\n\nWait, in the given text, Section XI is listed as \"XI. DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE\" on page 4. But the actual content of Section XI isn't included in the provided text. The text stops at page 24, which is part of Section VI (Individual Relief). So the section about duration might be in the next part of the document beyond token 10000.\n\nSince the current read was up to token 10000 (page 24), but the duration section (XI) is listed on page 4, maybe it's in the early part. Wait, the document's Table of Contents shows Section XI on page 4, but the actual text starts from page 1. The provided text includes up to page 24, so Section XI should be included if it's on page 4. Let me check the text again.\n\nLooking through the provided text, the Table of Contents mentions Section XI on page 4. The actual content of Section XI might be in the first few pages. Let me check the beginning of the document.\n\nIn the provided text, the Table of Contents lists Section XI as \"XI. DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE\" on page 4. Then the document starts with the actual text. The first few pages (1-4) would have the content for Section XI. But the user's read was from 0-10000 tokens, which covers up to page 24. Wait, the document has 21,015 tokens total, and they read 0-10000 (48% coverage). So page 4 would be within the first 10,000 tokens. Let me check the text for Section XI.\n\nLooking at the text provided, after the Table of Contents (which lists Section XI), the document starts with \"I. BACKGROUND AND STIPULATIONS...\" So the actual content of Section XI would be after the other sections. The Table of Contents shows Section XI as item 11, so it's after Section X. In the text, Section X is \"DISPUTE RESOLUTION\" on page 48, but the ToC says Section XI is on page 4. Wait, maybe the page numbers in the ToC are off. The document shows \"Case 1:24-cv-00838-TDS-JEP Document 2-2 Filed 10/07/24 Page 4 of 57\" after the ToC. So the ToC is on page 4, and the actual content starts on page 5. So Section XI (Duration) would be on page 48? Wait, the ToC lists XI as \"XI. DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE\" on page 48. Let me check the ToC again.\n\nIn the provided text, the Table of Contents lists:\n\nXI. DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE ........................................................ 48\n\nSo Section XI is on page 48. The current read goes up to page 24 (tokens 0-10000), so page 48 is beyond the current read. Therefore, the duration section hasn't been read yet. The user needs to read further in the Consent Decree document to find the duration.\n\nThe next step would be to read the next token range in the Consent Decree. Since the current read was 0-10000, the next part would be 10000-20000. But the document has 21,015 tokens, so 10000-20000 is 10,000 tokens, which is the max allowed per read_document.\n\nSo the correct action is to use read_document on Consent Decree, tokens 10000-20000. That way, they can get to page 48 where Section XI is located.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Consent Decree\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Consent Decree", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14018, "completion_tokens": 1115, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from the legal documents, specifically for the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\". \n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The checklist item is empty, and there's one document partially visited: Consent Decree (tokens 0-20000). The previous actions read the first 20,000 tokens, which is 95% coverage. The next step is to see if the duration is mentioned in the text already read.\n\nLooking at the provided document snippets, I need to find where the duration of the decree is specified. The key section would be under \"XI. DURATION OF THE CONSENT DECREE\" (Paragraph 136). Let me scan the text for that.\n\nIn the second read (tokens 10000-20000), I see paragraph 136:\n\n\"136. Unless extended for good cause by the Court and provided that there are no outstanding disputes being resolved pursuant to Paragraph 135, this Decree shall be dissolved without further order of the Court three (3) years and six (6) months after the Date of Entry described in Paragraph 32, or, if later, upon completion of the following:  \na. Fulfillment of the Parties’ obligations regarding General Injunctive Relief set forth in Section V of this Decree;  \nb.

The passage of thirty (30) days after the City provides the last of the reports regarding Priority Hiring Relief that are required by Paragraphs 115 and 128-129.\"\n\nSo the duration is \"three (3) years and six (6) months\" after the Date of Entry. The checklist requires the duration formatted as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". The obligation here is the dissolution of the decree, so the value would be \"3 years and 6 months: Dissolution of the Consent Decree\".\n\nI need to verify if this is the only duration mentioned. Scanning through the document, I don't see any other references to duration. The other sections like the Fairness Hearing deadlines (e.g., 130 days, 150 days) are timeframes for specific actions, not the overall decree duration. The main duration is clearly stated in paragraph 136.\n\nSince the document is partially visited up to 20,000 tokens (which covers the entire text provided), and the relevant section is included, I can now extract this value. The next step is to use `append_checklist` to add this entry with the evidence.\n\nThe evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text snippet is from paragraph 136, page 52 of the document (as per the page numbers in the document). The source is \"Consent Decree\", and the location is \"Section XI (Duration of the Consent Decree), Paragraph 136\".\n\nSo the extracted value should be:\n- value: \"3 years and 6 months: Dissolution of the Consent Decree\"\n- evidence: text from the paragraph, source \"Consent Decree\", location \"Section XI, Paragraph 136 (Page 52)\"\n\nI need to make sure this is the only value. The checklist says to extract every distinct value, and there's only one mentioned.

The task is to extract the decree duration from the legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. The user has already gone through steps 1-5, and in step 5, they used `append_checklist` to add one value from the Consent Decree document.\n\nLooking at the current status: the key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" has one value extracted from Section XI, Paragraph 136 of the Consent Decree, which states \"3 years and 6 months\" as the dissolution period. The document \"Consent Decree\" is partially visited (tokens 0-20000 out of 21,015), so there's still a small portion left (20000-21015 tokens) that hasn't been read yet. But the user has already found the relevant section in the first 20k tokens.\n\nWait, the Consent Decree's total tokens are 21,015, and they've read up to 20,000. The relevant paragraph (136) was found on page 52, which was within the first 20k tokens. The remaining tokens (20000-21015) might not contain more information about the duration, but I should check if there's any other mention elsewhere in the document. However, the checklist item specifies to extract every distinct value. The current extraction has one value: \"3 years and 6 months: Dissolution of the Consent Decree\".\n\nBut wait, the user needs to confirm if there are other instances of the decree duration in other documents. The available documents include \"Complaint\", \"Docket\", \"Order\", \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", and \"Joint Motion\". The Consent Decree is the primary document where the duration would be specified, but maybe other documents reference it.\n\nHowever, the current state shows that the key is filled with one value, and the empty keys count is 0. The system says to stop when all keys are filled or marked as Not Applicable. Since there's only one key (How_Long_Decrees_will_Last) and it's already filled, the next step should be to verify if there are any other values in the remaining document sections or other documents.\n\nWait, the Consent Decree's remaining tokens (20000-21015) might be the end of the document. The last part of the provided text in Step 4 ends at \"Case 1:24-cv-00838-TDS-JEP     Document 2-2     Filed 10/07/24     Page 52 of 57\", and the token count is 21,015. So the remaining tokens are probably the end of the document, which might not have more relevant info. The user has already read the relevant paragraph (136) which is on page 52, so the remaining tokens are likely the footer or signatures, not the duration.\n\nNow, checking the other documents: Complaint (3,422 tokens), Docket (3,382), Order (387), Notice (1,264), Joint Motion (1,149). These might not contain the decree duration since the Consent Decree is the main document where the duration is specified. The Complaint is the initial filing, Docket is the case log, Order might be a court order, but the duration would be in the Consent Decree itself.\n\nThe user's previous action was `append_checklist` with one value. The current status shows 1 out of 1 keys filled. The system says to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's filled, the next logical step is to stop. But wait, the user needs to make sure there are no other values. However, the instructions say that the decree duration is specified in the Consent Decree, and the user found it there. The other documents are unlikely to have this information. For example, the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" might not relate to the decree duration, as it's about dismissal, not the decree's term.\n\nAlso, the Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here because the value was found. The checklist has only one item, which is filled. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The user should call `stop` with the reason. The previous steps have already extracted the value, so no more actions are needed.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (How_Long_Decrees_will_Last) are fully extracted with evidence from Consent Decree (Section XI, Paragraph 136).
