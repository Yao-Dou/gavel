The Order directs CPB and federal agencies to cease all federal funding to NPR and PBS, and to prohibit local public radio stations from using federal funds to acquire NPR programming. The plaintiffs contend that the Order contravenes the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which explicitly prohibits government interference with CPB's funding decisions and requires that CPB distribute funds based on neutral criteria. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order is unlawful, a permanent injunction preventing its implementation, and vacatur of any agency actions implementing the Order."

The plaintiffs argue these provisions usurp congressional authority under the Elections Clause and violate the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act. On April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted a preliminary injunction against Sections 2(a) and 2(d), citing likelihood of success, irreparable harm, and favorable equities, while denying injunctions to Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b) due to lack of standing.

The plaintiffs—four state Head Start associations (Washington, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) and two parent-led organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland)—argue these actions violate constitutional provisions (the Fifth Amendment, the First Amendment, the Separation of Powers and Spending Clause) and federal statutes (the Head Start Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act). They seek a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation of these policies, asserting that hundreds of thousands of children and families will immediately lose access to critical early childhood education, health services, and childcare support, causing irreparable harm to children's development and parents' ability to work and pursue education. The case challenges the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Head Start program and is pending before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez in the Western District of Washington."
