The appellate court also determined that the government would suffer irreparable harm from being enjoined from implementing the order, and that any harm to the unions could be mitigated and, if necessary, remedied after litigation.",

The case also includes IHEP’s claim of unreasonable delay in disclosure‑risk review processing, the court’s denial of a preliminary injunction on June 3 2025, and subsequent amendments focusing on six discrete terminations. The factual basis centers on the Department’s mass termination of contracts and staff associated with IES research programs, impeding completion and dissemination of congressionally mandated education research and harming organizations and researchers who rely on these resources."

On June 19, 2025, a panel of the Ninth Circuit (Judges Bennett, Miller, and Sung) granted the stay pending appeal. The appellate court held that, while the President’s invocation of § 12406 is subject to judicial review, such review is highly deferential under longstanding precedent. Affording that deference, the court found it likely that the President acted within his statutory authority under § 12406(3) (inability of regular forces to execute the laws), and that transmitting the orders through the Adjutant General satisfied the procedural requirement. The Ninth Circuit also determined that, even if there were a procedural error, it would not justify the full scope of injunctive relief ordered by the district court. The court further concluded that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of the federal government, given the federal interest in protecting its personnel and property."

              "Antoninetti, represented by private counsel, claimed that architectural barriers—including a 45-inch-high wall separating the customer line from the food preparation area—prevented individuals in wheelchairs from viewing the food on display and the preparation process, thereby denying them the “Chipotle experience” and full and equal enjoyment of the restaurant’s goods and services as required by the ADA.",
              "During discovery and at trial, it was established that, although Chipotle had an unwritten policy to accommodate customers with disabilities, such as offering to show food samples or describing ingredients, Antoninetti and other wheelchair users could not independently see the food or watch the preparation as standing customers could.",

              "The appellate court held that the ADA required wheelchair users to have an experience comparable to that of other customers and that mere staff assistance or alternative methods were insufficient if the physical design itself remained inaccessible.",

The court reaffirmed the $5,000 damages award for five customer visits, denied damages for the litigation-related visits, and ultimately awarded more than $545,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to Antoninetti’s counsel, reflecting the protracted and complex nature of the litigation, the significance of the ADA violation, and the public benefit achieved by the ruling.",
