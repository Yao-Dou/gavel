              "On June 13, 2025, Judge Casper granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Executive Order’s provisions requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and military/overseas voting, pre-assessment of citizenship by public assistance agencies, federal enforcement against states’ ballot receipt laws, and conditioning of HAVA funding on compliance with an Election Day ballot receipt deadline were all unauthorized by the Constitution or federal statutes and intruded on state sovereignty.",

The defendants have since filed a motion to dismiss and appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Judge Denise J. Casper presides. The case remains ongoing as of August 2025.",

The challenged provisions also conflict with longstanding state laws and practices regarding voter registration and ballot processing."

The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem), the Acting Directors of ICE, CBP, USCIS, and President Donald Trump in their official capacities. Plaintiffs argue that these actions unlawfully expose paroled individuals to expedited removal, violating 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), agency regulations, and the Fifth Amendment due process. Judge Jia M. Cobb granted a stay on August 1, 2025, blocking the use of expedited removal for all paroled noncitizens pending resolution. The government has appealed the stay to the D.C. Circuit, and the case remains pending with no trial yet. Background: Expedited removal historically applies only to individuals encountered at the border or shortly after entry, and individuals paroled into the U.S. at ports of entry were not subject to expedited removal once inside."

              "The orders also directed prioritization of criminal enforcement under 18 U.S.C. § 116 (female genital mutilation) against providers of gender‑affirming care, despite the statutory inapplicability and lack of medical evidence supporting such prosecutions.",

The plaintiffs, representing state governments and pediatric endocrinologists, argue that the orders violate separation of powers, equal protection, due process, and state sovereignty.

In response, the Department of Education issued an internal directive on February 5, 2025, instructing staff to review and potentially terminate grants inconsistent with newly identified departmental priorities, particularly those related to DEI. Within days, the Department sent form termination letters to nearly all recipients of TQP and SEED grants, affecting over $250 million in awarded and obligated funds for teacher recruitment, training, and support across the plaintiff states. The termination letters cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) as authority, asserting that the grants no longer effectuated Department priorities, but failed to specify which rationale applied to each grant or provide individualized factual findings or prior notice.",

The government immediately appealed to the First Circuit and sought a stay, which was denied at both the district and appellate levels. However, the Supreme Court then granted an emergency application for a stay on April 4, 2025, and construed the TRO as an appealable preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court's per curiam opinion found the states' claims to be, in essence, contract actions for money damages, and thus likely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not the district court, and expressed doubt that the APA provided a waiver of sovereign immunity for the relief sought in this context. The Supreme Court also found that the risk of irretrievable payments justified a stay pending appeal.",

On August 7, 2025, the court granted a classwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Executive Order, prohibiting federal agencies from refusing to recognize citizenship or denying documentation or benefits to class members. The court found the class met all Rule 23 requirements, including numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy, and that plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed on their claims, that the class would face irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and the public interest strongly favored an injunction.
