The plaintiffs claimed this access was granted without the proper security vetting or clearances required by law and OPM's own protocols.

The challenged provisions included: (1) the \"Excuse Requirement\", which limits eligibility for absentee mail-in voting to specific categories of voters; (2) the \"Witness Requirement\", which mandates a witness signature on an absentee ballot; and (3) the \"Cure Prohibition\", an alleged failure to provide voters with notice and an opportunity to fix errors on their absentee ballots.",
