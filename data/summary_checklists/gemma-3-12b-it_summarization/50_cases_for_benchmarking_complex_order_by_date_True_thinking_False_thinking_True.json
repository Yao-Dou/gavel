Haniyeh. The plaintiffs fear disclosure of their personal information could lead to public scrutiny or vigilante action, and seek declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages for alleged violations of the Privacy Act and other constitutional and statutory rights. The Department of Justice argues that the plaintiffs lack standing, that the request for injunctive relief exceeds its scope, and that the information gathering is part of a lawful review under an Executive Order with no intent to misuse employee data. On February 7, 2025, the court entered a consent order temporarily preventing the government from disclosing the list of personnel involved in the investigations pending a March 27, 2025 hearing for a preliminary injunction. The case was consolidated with a related case (25-cv-0325), and further filings are expected before a final determination."

The plaintiffs alleged that these orders, which restrict speech critical of the U.S. government or the government of Israel, violate the First and Fifth Amendments. Specifically, Mr. Taal, a non-citizen student, faced potential deportation due to his advocacy for Palestinian rights and the government's interpretation of his speech as hostile. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the orders. Shortly after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent Mr. Taal’s detention and potential removal. The court initially denied the ex parte request and scheduled a hearing, ordering the parties to submit briefs. The government argued that the actions were necessary for national security and to combat anti-Semitism. Following the initial filings and court proceedings, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case on March 31, 2025, without prejudice. The court subsequently dismissed the case, ending the legal challenge to the executive orders. The case involved claims of threats to Mr. Taal's immigration status based on his protected speech, raising concerns about potential First Amendment violations and due process rights."
