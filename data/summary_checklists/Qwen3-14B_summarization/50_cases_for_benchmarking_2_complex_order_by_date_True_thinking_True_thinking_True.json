They assert that SEVIS termination, which governs their legal status, was conducted without due process or legal justification, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block enforcement actions, including arrests, transfers, or deportations, and to restore their SEVIS records and F-1 status. On April 17, 2025, Judge Noel Wise granted the TRO, enjoining defendants for 14 days from taking adverse actions. The case was later reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, who extended the TRO and set a preliminary injunction hearing for May 13, 2025. The court also consolidated the case with similar lawsuits nationwide, including *Doe v. Trump*. Defendants argued that SEVIS termination does not automatically revoke F-1 status and that plaintiffs had not sought reinstatement under 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16), but the court found serious questions about the legality of the terminations. On May 14, 2025, Judge White granted preliminary injunctions in this case and related matters, preserving the status quo pending further proceedings. Defendants subsequently appealed, but the court denied a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal on August 22, 2025. The case remains active, with a case management conference scheduled for September 2025. Plaintiffs allege the mass SEVIS terminations, occurring amid threats of federal funding cuts and publicized retaliatory actions, have caused widespread fear and disruption to their education and employment, necessitating judicial intervention to ensure compliance with legal standards and due process."
