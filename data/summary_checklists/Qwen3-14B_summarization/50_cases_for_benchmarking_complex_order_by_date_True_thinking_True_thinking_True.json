              "On April 18, 2025, Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national and student at Minnesota State University, filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, challenging his detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Freeborn County Jail. He alleged violations of the First Amendment (retaliatory enforcement based on his pro-Palestinian social media posts), the Fifth Amendment (due process concerns from prolonged detention without individualized justification), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (unlawful termination of his SEVIS record without proper process). The case involved private counsel from Fredrikson & Byron, the ACLU of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic, opposing the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Freeborn County Attorney’s Office.  \n\nOn April 22, 2025, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent ICE from transferring Mohammed H. out of Minnesota pending further proceedings. The TRO was extended multiple times, most recently until June 3, 2025. On May 5, 2025, the court ordered his release on a $7,500 bond after an immigration judge found him not a danger to the community. The Government appealed this decision to the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025.  \n\nIn a June 17, 2025, order, U.S. District Judge Jerry W. Blackwell granted Mohammed H.’s habeas petition, ruling that his detention violated constitutional and statutory protections. The court found that his SEVIS termination and visa revocation lacked lawful basis, his arrest appeared motivated by protected speech, and the automatic stay invoked by ICE to block his release was arbitrary. The judgment released him from custody under the previously imposed bond conditions. The case remains subject to appeal."

President and Fellows of Harvard College* (SFFA) decision, but plaintiffs argued it unlawfully restricted teaching about race, systemic racism, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, violating the First Amendment’s free speech protections and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause due to vagueness.",

They also argued the Certification violated the Paperwork Reduction Act by lacking an OMB control number and procedural safeguards.",

The order, issued on January 20, 2025, directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to pause funding and required the Secretary of State and USAID to suspend or terminate grants and contracts, citing alignment with foreign policy. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation-of-powers principles, as well as the Take Care Clause, arguing the freeze and terminations exceeded executive authority and disregarded congressional appropriations. The court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, temporarily halting the defendants’ blanket suspension of funds for grants and contracts existing as of January 19, 2025, but allowed individualized terminations based on statutory authority. Subsequent motions to enforce the TRO and hold defendants in contempt were partially granted, requiring compliance by February 26, 2025. Defendants appealed, seeking a stay pending review, but the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, noting the TRO was not appealable. The Supreme Court denied the government’s request to vacate the enforcement order and directed the district court to clarify compliance timelines. On March 10, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and requiring the resumption of payments under the 2024 Appropriations Act. However, the D.C. Circuit later held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action for their constitutional and APA claims, emphasizing that statutory disputes over impoundment must be resolved through the Comptroller General, not private litigation. The Supreme Court’s decision in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (2025) further clarified that the ICA and APA precluded judicial review of the executive’s actions, leading to the vacatur of the preliminary injunction’s impoundment provisions. The case underscores tensions between executive discretion in foreign affairs and congressional spending authority, with the court ultimately deferring to statutory processes for resolving disputes over fund allocations."

              "Judge Marcia G. Cooke adopted the TRO, later extending it, and issued a preliminary injunction requiring ICE to comply with CDC guidelines, including reducing overcrowding, providing PPE, and ceasing unsafe cohorting of confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 cases.",
              "ICE contested compliance, arguing it had implemented measures to mitigate risks, but the court found its actions demonstrated deliberate indifference to detainees’ safety.",
              "A special master, Matthew C. Dates, inspected the facilities and confirmed ongoing violations of social distancing and hygiene standards.",
              "In June 2021, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which required ICE to fully implement CDC guidelines, provide free COVID-19 vaccinations, and ensure seasonal flu vaccinations at no cost.",

              "The case highlighted systemic failures in ICE detention practices during the pandemic, with the court emphasizing that constitutional rights protections apply to civil detainees, even in the absence of criminal convictions.",

The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman, who recommended a temporary restraining order (TRO) and partial class certification for conditions‑of‑confinement claims but denied certification for habeas corpus release requests. Judge Marcia G. Cooke adopted the TRO, later extending it, and issued a preliminary injunction requiring ICE to comply with CDC guidelines, reduce overcrowding, provide PPE, and cease unsafe cohorting of confirmed and unconfirmed COVID‑19 cases. ICE’s claimed compliance was found insufficient and the court found deliberate indifference to detainees’ safety. A special master, Matthew C. Dates, inspected the facilities and confirmed ongoing violations of social distancing and hygiene standards. In June 2021, the parties reached a settlement agreement requiring ICE to fully implement CDC guidelines, provide free COVID‑19 vaccinations, and ensure seasonal flu vaccinations at no cost; the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and a special master continued to monitor compliance. The settlement resolved claims related to unsafe detention conditions, though individual habeas petitions remained permissible.
