They bring nine causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of the First Amendment’s Free‑Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal‑Protection Clause, and Washington’s Constitution (Article I, § 11).  The remedy sought is declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically a preliminary injunction that would prevent the state from enforcing SB 5375 against the plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall under their administration.",

The court, Judge David G. Estudillo, held a hearing on July 14, 2025, and on July 18, 2025 issued an order granting the injunction.  The court enjoined enforcement of SB 5375 as it applies to the sacrament of confession for the plaintiffs and for all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who are under the administration of the plaintiffs’ dioceses.  The injunction does not address the plaintiffs’ other constitutional claims but preserves the status quo pending a final judgment.",

The court granted the U.S.’s motion to intervene on July 15, 2025, allowing the U.S. to seek relief in the same case.  The U.S. also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 25, 2025 and the court scheduled a hearing for July 23, 2025.
