The student group filed suit on March 5, 2025. The case is supported by evidence including the student group’s reservation and ticket sales, the board resolution, the university’s notification of cancellation and ticket refunds, and the student group’s claim that the board meeting was held less than 72 hours in advance, violating the Texas Open Meetings Act. Background information includes the University’s policies that allow content‑ and viewpoint‑neutral use of campus venues, the Board’s justification that such shows demean women and promote gender ideology under a federal executive order, and the court’s findings that the resolution was a viewpoint‑based prior restraint, unconstitutionally vague, and lacked a compelling basis under Title IX."

              "The bishops and priests allege SB 5375 compels them to violate the Catholic Church’s sacramental seal of Confession, under threat of criminal prosecution (a gross misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $5,000 fine) and civil liability, and that their dioceses already require reporting suspected abuse and neglect learned outside Confession.",
              "July 18, 2025: The court granted a preliminary injunction. It held the bishops and priests had standing and that their claims were ripe. On the merits, the court found a likelihood of success on the Free Exercise claim: SB 5375 burdens religious practice and is not neutral or generally applicable because it treats comparable secular activity more favorably (e.g., preserves attorney‑client confidentiality for university attorneys under SHB 1171 while denying religious confidentiality to clergy).",
              "Scope and Terms of the Preliminary Injunction: In light of the Supreme Court’s guidance on injunction breadth, the court enjoined enforcement of SB 5375 “as to the Sacrament of Confession” against the bishops, priests, and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall directly under the administration of the Archbishop of Seattle and the Bishops of Yakima and Spokane.",

The case is supported by the court’s preliminary injunction granted on July 18, 2025, which enjoined enforcement of SB 5375 ‘as to the Sacrament of Confession’ against these clergy, and background information that the bill takes effect July 27, 2025, that House Bill 1171 preserves attorney‑client confidentiality for university attorneys, and that the United States intervened in the case citing equal protection grounds."

The plaintiffs claim violations of the First Amendment, the APA, Title VI, and other constitutional provisions, seeking to restore the terminated funds and prevent future cuts without Title VI procedures. The evidence supporting these claims includes the March 7 cancellation announcement, the NIH termination notice citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and the NIH Grants Policy Statement, the HHS FAR 52.249‑5 termination for convenience, the March 13 letter with nine preconditions, and Columbia’s March 21 announcement of an 18‑point anti‑discrimination plan.

The court found the unions’ alleged First Amendment chilling effects to be subjective and speculative, noted Columbia had represented it had planned its March 21 measures for months and did not simply implement the agencies’ demands, and observed that Columbia had committed to cover certain salaries previously supported by grants. The court also flagged that the Supreme Court’s recent stay in Department of Education v. California, 145 S.

Howell) issued a detailed memorandum opinion and order on May 19, 2025, granting plaintiffs’ motion and denying defendants’ cross‑motion. Reported at 2025 WL 1428641, the opinion held: (1) USIP is part of the federal government for separation‑of‑powers purposes but is not part of the Executive Branch and does not wield Article II executive power; (2) the President therefore lacked constitutional authority to ignore 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)’s limited removal mechanisms for appointed Board members; and (3) even if USIP were within the Executive Branch, the Board’s multimember, bipartisan, expert structure and its de minimis, if any, executive power brought it within Humphrey’s Executor and its progeny, so the USIP Act’s removal protections were constitutional. The court declared the President’s removal of the twelve appointed Board members unlawful, null, and void; declared the ex officio members’ removal of Moose and the appointments of Jackson and Cavanaugh as USIP president invalid; declared that Moose remains USIP’s president and may be removed only by a duly constituted Board under § 4606; declared all actions taken or authorized by Jackson or Cavanaugh as acting presidents invalid; and declared void the transfer of USIP’s headquarters and other assets to GSA and the appointment of an Endowment officer to move Endowment funds. The court permanently enjoined defendants (other than ex officio Board members acting within their board roles) from trespassing on USIP property; from maintaining, gaining, or exercising access or control over USIP offices, facilities, systems, records, or resources; from acting or purporting to act in USIP’s name; and from using USIP’s name, emblem, seal, or other marks.

              "On April 22, 2025, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint expanding their claims. They allege the State Department and USAID executed “tranches” of mass terminations based on cursory spreadsheets and action memoranda signed by the Secretary, constituting pretextual, post hoc rationalizations for the earlier freeze; that the agencies are moving to retire USAID’s independent operations and shift or eliminate programs; and that defendants’ decisions to “shut down” congressionally mandated programs and to hold funds in reserve violate the ICA, Anti‑Deficiency Act, Purpose Act, and the 2024 Appropriations Act.",
              "Factual context: The record shows that, after Executive Order 14169, State and USAID paused obligations and disbursements and issued stop‑work orders, in some instances halting payment even for completed work. OMB issued a government‑wide pause memorandum (M‑25‑13) that was later enjoined in separate litigation. Within weeks, State and USAID announced tens of hundreds of suspensions and terminations. Plaintiffs submitted declarations detailing widespread program disruptions and financial distress (including staff furloughs/layoffs, shuttered offices, and stranded commodities) and later alleged that defendants intend to realign or retire substantial USAID functions and not obligate large portions of appropriated funds absent judicial relief.",
              "Appeals followed. The government appealed the preliminary injunction (Nos. 25‑5097/5098). On August 13, 2025, a D.C. Circuit panel vacated the impoundment portion of the injunction, holding plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to press that claim, with a dissent. On August 20, 2025, the en banc D.C. Circuit entered an order stating that “the preliminary injunction that requires the government to obligate the appropriated funds remains in effect,” and the district court denied the government’s motion for a partial stay pending mandate. As of the latest district‑court orders, defendants continue to file periodic status reports and to process payments for pre‑TRO work, while the obligation/impoundment and termination issues remain under active enforcement and appellate review."
            ],
            "value": "The case involves a challenge to the Executive Branch’s suspension and termination of U.S. foreign‑aid funding following President Trump’s January 20, 2025 Executive Order 14169. U.S. nonprofits and companies implementing State Department and USAID awards sued, alleging the government unlawfully froze obligations and disbursements, issued stop‑work orders, and mass‑terminated thousands of awards, ignoring Congress’s 2024 appropriations and statutory limits on impoundment. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and the court granted a TRO on February 13, 2025, and a preliminary injunction on March 10, 2025, enjoining further terminations and requiring payment for work completed before February 13. The case is supported by evidence such as the executive order, the TRO and injunction orders, the government pause memorandum M‑25‑13, plaintiffs’ declarations of program disruptions, and subsequent appellate rulings."

It found plaintiffs likely to succeed on separation‑of‑powers and APA claims, concluding the record showed defendants had undertaken “a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely,” contrary to Congress’s mandate.",
