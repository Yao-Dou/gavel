Kennedy Human Rights, the Southern Border Communities Coalition, and legal services organization Urban Justice Center—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security. Represented by private counsel and non-profit legal groups including Public Citizen Litigation Group, Democracy Forward Foundation, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unlawfully closed three statutorily mandated DHS oversight offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CISOM), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).",
              "The complaint asserted that on March 21, 2025, DHS abruptly ceased the operations of these offices, placing nearly all employees on administrative leave and terminating contractors, with separation dates set for May 23, 2025.",
              "The plaintiffs contended that these actions violated the constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically alleging that the defendants acted in excess of statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) and arbitrarily and capriciously (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). They also cited violations of the Impoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act in subsequent filings.",

The defendants publicly stated the offices were closed because they “obstructed immigration enforcement.”",
              "On May 8, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to immediately halt the termination of the offices' functions, prevent the destruction of records, reinstate employees and contractors, and resume complaint processing. An evidentiary hearing was held on May 19 and 20, 2025. On May 23, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which Judge Reyes denied without prejudice after an evidentiary hearing. Following the denial of the TRO, a Reduction-in-Force (RIF) became effective on May 23, 2025, effectively removing 99% of the employees from the three offices.",
              "Throughout May and June 2025, the parties filed several status reports, revealing a dispute over the defendants' commitment to restoring the offices' functions. While the defendants indicated they were expediting new hires and seeking detailees, the plaintiffs raised concerns about the sincerity of these efforts. They pointed to conflicting public statements, including the FY2026 budget justification which stated OIDO had been “eliminated in its entirety” and proposed significantly reduced “interim” funding for CRCL and CISOM. Plaintiffs also noted that job postings for new positions excluded former employees affected by the RIF, contrary to earlier court assurances. The plaintiffs argued that this pattern of inconsistent conduct undermined the defendants' credibility and demonstrated an ongoing intent to diminish or eliminate the offices.",

Numerous hospitals nationwide, including those serving the individual plaintiffs, consequently halted gender-affirming medical care for patients under 19, citing fear of losing federal funding.

              "The case, *Nicolas Talbott, et al. v. United States of America, et al.*, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00240, was initially filed on January 28, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, a group of transgender service members and prospective service members, were represented by private and non-profit legal counsel, including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The defendants included the United States of America, the Secretary of Defense, and various acting secretaries and departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Defense Health Agency. The President of the United States was initially named as a defendant but was later dismissed by court order.",
              "The lawsuit challenged President Donald J. Trump’s January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183 ('Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness'), and related provisions of Executive Order 14168 ('Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government'), along with implementing memoranda from the Department of Defense (DoD). These policies reversed the prior 2021 Austin Policy, which allowed transgender individuals to serve openly in the U.S. military. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection component, asserting that the ban discriminated against them based on sex and transgender status, procedural due process, and estoppel. They sought declaratory judgment that the ban was unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent their categorical exclusion from military service, to ensure access to medically necessary care, and to prevent requirements that they serve in their birth sex.",
              "The challenged Executive Order 14183, issued seven days after President Trump took office, declared transgender status incompatible with military standards like readiness, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. It incorporated definitions from Executive Order 14168 that define 'sex' as an immutable biological classification at conception, explicitly aimed at denying legal recognition to transgender individuals. The Order mandated revisions to military medical standards, prohibited 'identification-based' pronoun usage, and required sex-segregated facilities based on birth sex.",
              "The Secretary of Defense, Peter B. Hegseth, issued 'Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness' on February 26, 2025 (the 'Hegseth Policy'), which implemented the ban, paused new accessions for individuals with a history or symptoms of gender dysphoria, and halted gender-affirming medical procedures. This policy also initiated administrative separation proceedings for current transgender service members, offering a waiver that the court later described as an 'exemption in name only' due to stringent conditions that virtually no transgender person could meet.",
              "The plaintiffs, many with decades of honorable and decorated service, testified to the direct harm caused by the ban, including the cancellation of medically necessary gender-affirming surgeries, removal from training programs, placement on administrative absence, and the loss of career opportunities. They argued that the ban was based on animus and conjecture, lacking support from military studies, including the 2016 RAND report and more recent DoD reviews, which generally indicated no adverse impact from transgender service.",
              "On March 18, 2025, Judge Ana C. Reyes of the District Court granted the plaintiffs' Renewed Application for Preliminary Injunction, ruling that the Military Ban was likely unconstitutional. The court found that the ban was 'soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,' lacked a rational basis, and failed intermediate scrutiny because it classified individuals based on sex and transgender status without an 'exceedingly persuasive' justification. The court noted that the ban's language was 'unabashedly demeaning' and its conclusions 'bear no relation to fact,' contradicting military leaders' testimony that transgender service members are fit and contribute positively. Judge Reyes' order (2025 WL 842332) preliminarily enjoined the implementation of Executive Order 14183, the Hegseth Policy, and any related directives, effectively reinstating the 2021 Austin Policy. The court ordered defendants to maintain the plaintiffs' military statuses and to take steps to effectuate the order.",
              "Defendants subsequently moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction and for a stay pending appeal, citing new 'Military Department Identification Guidance' (MDI Guidance) issued on March 21, 2025. On March 26, 2025, Judge Reyes denied this motion (2025 WL 914716), reiterating that the MDI Guidance did not alter her conclusion and further confirmed the ban's animus and lack of reasoned judgment. She again sua sponte stayed her order until March 28, 2025, to allow defendants to seek an emergency stay from the D.C. Circuit.",
              "On March 26, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Case #25-5087) and an Emergency Motion for Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal. On March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an Order granting an administrative stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction pending further order from the appellate court. Related cases include prior litigation challenging the first Trump administration's transgender military ban (e.g., *Doe 1 v. Trump*, *Doe 2 v. Shanahan*, *Stone v. Trump*, *Karnoski v. Trump*, *Stockman v. Trump*) and other ongoing challenges to the current ban (*Shilling v. Trump*, *Ireland v. Hegseth*).",

              "The factual basis for the case centered on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, which led Governor John Bel Edwards to declare a state of emergency and issue stay-at-home orders, and to twice postpone state elections. For the July 11 and August 15, 2020 elections, Louisiana adopted an Emergency Election Plan. However, the plaintiffs argued that this plan, and existing state election laws, failed to adequately protect voters from COVID-19 risks for all 2020 elections (July 11, August 15, November 3, and December 5). Specifically, they challenged three provisions: (1) the \"Excuse Requirement\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1303), which limited absentee voting by mail to specific categories of voters, even with the emergency plan's narrow additions for July/August; (2) the \"Witness Requirement\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1306(E)(2)(a)), which mandated an in-person witness signature for absentee ballots (later amended by Senate Bill 75 to restrict who could serve as a witness); and (3) the \"Cure Prohibition\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1313), which denied absentee voters notice or opportunity to correct ballot defects (an emergency rule on June 15, 2020, allowed in-person curing, which plaintiffs deemed insufficient).",
              "The plaintiffs argued that these challenged provisions forced many voters, particularly those at high risk from COVID-19 or living with high-risk individuals (such as plaintiff Telisa Clark, who has underlying health conditions, and plaintiff Lakeshia Barnett, who lives with high-risk family members), to choose between exercising their right to vote and endangering their health. They contended that these burdens disproportionately affected Black voters, who face higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death due to systemic socioeconomic and health disparities.",
