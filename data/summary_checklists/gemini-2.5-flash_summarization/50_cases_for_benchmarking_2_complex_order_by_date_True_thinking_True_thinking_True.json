The court stayed the effective dates of seven provisions of the 2025 Rule pending a final ruling on the merits. These provisions included: (1) a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees; (2) the revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums; (3) a stricter failure-to-reconcile tax policy that removed a grace period; (4) new special enrollment period (SEP) eligibility verification requirements; (5) a requirement for Exchanges to verify household income inconsistencies when attested income differs from \"trusted data sources\"; (6) changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations; and (7) changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income when tax data is unavailable. The court found that the plaintiffs, particularly Main Street Alliance members and the city governments, had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits for these provisions, were likely to suffer irreparable harm from increased premiums and uncompensated care costs, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored preventing the Rule from taking effect.

This action followed earlier layoffs of probationary employees and was explicitly acknowledged by Secretary Kennedy as a rapid, \"decisive action\" taken to maintain \"political momentum,\" despite foreseeing that up to 20% of the terminations would be \"mistakes\" due to a lack of careful, line‑by‑line review of job responsibilities."

This campaign began with Executive Orders in January 2025, targeting 'DEI programs' and antisemitism, leading to the formation of a multi-agency 'Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.'",
              "Similar federal actions, including funding freezes, were reportedly taken against other universities like Columbia, Cornell, and Northwestern.",
              "Regarding Harvard University, the defendants, comprising various federal agencies (including the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Energy, Defense, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the National Science Foundation, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration), announced on March 31, 2025, a 'comprehensive review' of Harvard's federal funding, citing unspecified failures to address antisemitism and 'promoting divisive ideologies.'",
              "On April 3, the defendants sent a letter to Harvard, alleging it 'fundamentally failed' to protect students and demanding 'immediate' and sweeping 'reforms' as preconditions for continued funding. These demands included programmatic changes to 'improve viewpoint diversity and end ideological capture,' overhauling student discipline, enacting a 'mask ban,' and 'shuttering' all 'DEI programs.'",
              "An April 11 letter expanded on these demands, adding requirements such as a 'comprehensive audit' of hiring and admissions for 'viewpoint diversity,' reporting foreign students for conduct violations, and sanctioning faculty.",
              "On April 14, Harvard rejected these demands, asserting violations of its First Amendment and statutory rights. Hours later, the defendants announced a freeze of over $2 billion in federal funding to Harvard.",
              "Subsequently, on May 5, the Secretary of Education declared that Harvard would receive no future federal grants due to its alleged 'systemic pattern of violating federal law' and its refusal to implement the administration's 'common-sense reforms.'",
              "Between May 6 and May 12, various federal agencies issued letters terminating approximately $2.7 billion in grants to Harvard, citing general allegations of antisemitism and race discrimination and Harvard's non-compliance with the earlier demands.",
              "The defendants also cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (agency priorities) as a basis for some terminations.",
              "The plaintiffs contend that these actions have caused severe and irreparable harm to their members—faculty, graduate students, and researchers—by halting academic research, delaying experiments, jeopardizing careers, forcing layoffs, and disrupting academic progress.",
              "This includes research in critical areas such as public health, national defense, and scientific advancement.",
              "The plaintiffs also assert that the defendants' actions have created a pervasive climate of fear and self-censorship on campus, leading some members to modify their research and teaching.",
              "They highlight that Harvard has already made some concessions, such as centralizing student discipline and closing its DEI office, demonstrating the coercive impact of the defendants' actions.",
              "The plaintiffs argue that the defendants failed to follow Title VI's mandatory procedural requirements (such as notice, hearing, and specific findings) and that their actions were arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional coercion, viewpoint discrimination, and retaliation."

              "First, OPM directed federal agencies to identify and determine whether to retain probationary employees, leading to mass firings of an estimated 220,000 such employees across various agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
              "Second, OPM implemented a \"deferred resignation program\" in January 2025, inviting federal employees to resign by September 30, 2025, while retaining pay and benefits; approximately 75,000 employees opted into this program before it closed on February 12, 2025.",
              "Third, on February 11, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14210, titled \"Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative,\" which directed agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions-in-force (RIFs), prioritizing employees in non-mandated functions, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and those deemed nonessential during government shutdowns (an estimated 345,000 employees). Firings under this Executive Order also began in February 2025.",
              "The unions asserted two causes of action: first, that the mass firings and forced resignations violated separation of powers principles by undermining Congress's authority to create, fund, and assign missions to federal agencies (based on the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 1); and second, that agency defendants were violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by implementing RIFs contrary to statutory and regulatory requirements (citing 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and 5 C.F.R. Part 351).",

On February 14, 2025, the unions filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. On February 20, 2025, Judge Cooper denied this motion, ruling that the court likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the claims fell within the exclusive administrative and judicial review scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS).",

On May 15, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. However, on May 27, 2025, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) voluntarily dismissed itself as a plaintiff. Subsequently, on June 6, 2025, Judge Cooper granted the unions' motion to amend their complaint, striking the defendants' May 15th motion to dismiss, and ordered the defendants to respond to the Second Amended Complaint by June 27, 2025.

The unions allege that these actions violate separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, seeking declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to halt the RIFs and related actions, and attorneys' fees. The case has undergone multiple procedural developments, including initial assignment to Judge Paul L. Friedman, reassignment to Judge Christopher R. Cooper, denial of a temporary restraining order on February 20, 2025 due to jurisdiction concerns, subsequent amendments to the complaint, and multiple motions to dismiss, with the latest motion pending as of the last docket entry."

              "The injunction ordered the defendants to maintain agency data, reinstate previously terminated probationary and term employees, cease further RIFs or terminations (except for cause), not enforce the stop-work order, provide employees with necessary work access, ensure the Office of Consumer Response maintained its complaint systems, and rescind contract termination notices.",
              "Defendants appealed this preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (Case No. 25-5091) on March 29, 2025. Related cases included NTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), where Judge Cooper denied a preliminary injunction for NTEU's employment claims, and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2025 WL 814500 (D. Md. Mar. 14, 2025). On April 11, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial stay of the District Court's injunction (Doc 2110720), allowing RIFs and work stoppages only if defendants conducted a \"particularized assessment\" that affected employees/work were unnecessary to statutory duties. Following this, on April 17, 2025, the CFPB issued RIF notices to 1408 employees. On April 18, 2025, Judge Jackson issued an interim order (Doc 113) suspending this RIF and prohibiting the cutoff of employee computer access, pending a hearing to determine compliance with the partially stayed injunction. Defendants appealed this interim order (Case No. 25-5132). On April 28, 2025, the D.C. Circuit lifted its partial stay of the RIF prohibition (Doc 2113309), fully reinstating the District Court's ban on RIFs. Appeal No. 25-5132 was voluntarily dismissed by defendants on May 7, 2025, and granted on May 12, 2025.",
              "Ultimately, on August 15, 2025, the D.C. Circuit (Judges Katsas and Rao, with Judge Pillard dissenting) vacated the District Court's preliminary injunction (Doc 2130273, 2025 WL 2130273). The majority held that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the employment-related claims of the NTEU and CFPB Employee Association, as these claims must proceed through the exclusive review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act. For the remaining plaintiffs, the D.C. Circuit concluded that their claims targeted neither \"final agency action\" reviewable under the APA (as the alleged \"shutdown decision\" was abstract and not a sufficiently discrete, binding agency statement) nor unconstitutional action reviewable in equity (as the claims were statutory violations rephrased as constitutional ones, per Dalton v. Specter). The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.",

            "value": "The case involves a complaint filed by the National Treasury Employees Union on February 9, 2025, alleging that the Trump Administration, through Acting Director Russell Vought, unlawfully attempted to dismantle the CFPB. Key factual events include President Trump's firing of CFPB Director Rohit Chopra on January 31, 2025; the issuance of directives pausing most CFPB activities on February 7, 2025, and a stop-work order on February 10, 2025; the shutdown of the CFPB website; the termination of approximately 85 probationary and 130 term employees and cancellation of over $100 million in contracts; and planned large-scale reductions in force. These actions were countered by a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on March 28, 2025, which prohibited data destruction, employee terminations, RIF notices, and fund transfers, and ordered reinstatement of terminated employees and maintenance of agency data. The defendants appealed, leading the D.C. Circuit to issue a partial stay on April 11, 2025, allow RIFs only under a particularized assessment, lift the stay on April 28, 2025, and ultimately vacate the injunction on August 15, 2025, citing lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction and abstract nature of the alleged shutdown decision. Background context includes the CFPB’s creation by the Dodd‑Frank Act in 2010 as an independent agency to protect consumers and ensure financial stability, and the statutory and constitutional claims invoked (separation of powers, Appointments Clause, APA)."

Specter). The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion."

The plaintiffs asserted that these harms violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages ($1,465 for Suzanne and Geraldine Artis, and $2,085 for Bradley Kleinerman and James Gehre). The background includes the Executive Branch's withdrawal of defense of DOMA in February 2011 and the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the U.S. House of Representatives intervening to defend the statute."

Evans, who had a history of intravenous drug use, highlighted the risk of failed peripheral IV access and the lack of adequately trained personnel, contending that the protocol's use of an ultra‑short‑acting barbiturate in bursts created a high risk that inmates would be conscious during the administration of the paralytic and heart‑stopping drugs. The court denied his temporary restraining order on February 1, 2006. Evans also filed a state complaint on January 20, 2006, with NAACP, ACLU, and CASE, alleging violations of the Maryland Death Penalty Procedures Statute and the Administrative Procedure Act because the DOC's execution protocols were not properly adopted regulations. The Maryland Court of Appeals dismissed the organizational plaintiffs but found merit in Evans’s claim that the lethal injection checklist was an ineffective regulation, leading to a bench trial from September to November 2006. The federal case proceeded with the judge denying the state's motion to dismiss on September 14, 2006, and holding a bench trial from September 18 to November 15, 2006. The parties filed a consent motion to stay the federal proceedings on February 21, 2007, citing pending legislative bills that could either exempt death penalty protocols from APA requirements or repeal the death penalty entirely; the U.S. District Court granted the stay on February 22, 2007.
