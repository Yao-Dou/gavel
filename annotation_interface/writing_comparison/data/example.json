            "summary_A": "On July 1, 2025, twenty states\u2014including California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington\u2014filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Each state was represented by its Attorney General\u2019s office using public (government) counsel. The states sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its Secretary, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe states challenged a new federal practice, initiated in June 2025, in which HHS, through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), transferred large quantities of personally identifiable Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including health and immigration status information\u2014from state Medicaid agencies to DHS, specifically to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for use in immigration enforcement. This marked a sharp departure from longstanding federal policy under which such data was kept confidential and not used for immigration purposes. The states alleged that this data transfer was done without notice, public input, or reasoned decision-making, and over the objections of career staff. Media reports indicated the data was transferred rapidly and without anonymization, and that the federal government had entered into agreements with technology contractors to combine this data with other federal databases for enforcement and surveillance purposes.\n\nThe states argued that this policy change violated several federal statutes and constitutional provisions. Their claims were brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law; under the Social Security Act, the Privacy Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which govern the confidentiality and permissible uses of Medicaid data; and under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution for lack of clear notice of such a condition on federal Medicaid funding. The states sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief barring further data transfers and use for immigration enforcement, and the destruction of any unlawfully transferred data.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centered on the states\u2019 participation in Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for low-income individuals, which requires ongoing data sharing with CMS for program administration, eligibility verification, and oversight. The states described their reliance on federal assurances and regulations that restrict the use of this data to program administration, and asserted that the sudden policy change would undermine public trust, chill participation in Medicaid (especially among immigrants and mixed-status families), and harm public health and state finances.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria. On July 11, 2025, the states moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the data transfers and use of their Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. After a hearing, Judge Chhabria granted the motion in part on August 12, 2025. The court found that while federal law does not categorically prohibit HHS from sharing data with DHS, the agencies\u2019 abrupt reversal of longstanding confidentiality policies\u2014without reasoned decision-making or consideration of reliance interests\u2014likely violated the APA\u2019s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action. The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting HHS from sharing Medicaid data from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement, and prohibiting DHS from using such data for those purposes, including data already acquired. The injunction remains in effect until the agencies complete a reasoned decision-making process (or rulemaking, if required) addressing the policy change and its consequences.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and the case remains pending. The court denied, without prejudice, the states\u2019 request for a ruling that notice-and-comment rulemaking was required for the policy change, and declined to reach the Spending Clause claim at this stage, finding it moot in light of the APA ruling. The court has not yet issued a final decision on the merits. No monitor has been appointed, and no settlement or decree has been reached. As of the latest docket entries, the court scheduled further case management to determine the next steps, including possible summary judgment or waiting for agency action. There are no reported opinions cited beyond the court's preliminary injunction order (2025 WL [not provided]). No consolidated or related cases are identified in the record.",
            "summary_B": "This case challenged the Trump administration\u2019s disclosure of confidential Medicaid beneficiary data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement. On July 1, 2025, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective state attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Vince Chhabria.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in early June 2025, HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) secretly transferred Medicaid beneficiary data\u2014including names, addresses, Medicaid IDs, immigration status, and potentially protected health information\u2014to DHS. Following internal agency objections, HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formalized this arrangement on July 9, 2025, through an Interagency Exchange Agreement (IEA), granting ICE direct access to CMS\u2019s Integrated Data Repository and the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), containing over 78 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 personal records. Plaintiffs claimed this unprecedented transfer violated federal statutes strictly limiting disclosure of Medicaid data to purposes directly connected to Medicaid administration, and undermined decades of federal assurances regarding patient privacy.\n\nPlaintiffs also alleged procedural and constitutional violations. They asserted that HHS\u2019s decision constituted a final agency action requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider reliance interests and severe public health consequences, and that the new data-sharing policy retroactively imposed ambiguous, coercive conditions on federal Medicaid funding contrary to the Spending Clause.\n\nOn July 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit HHS from further transferring Medicaid data to DHS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), or other federal agencies, and to bar DHS from using the data for immigration enforcement or population surveillance. In support, plaintiffs submitted declarations from senior Medicaid officials in California, Washington, Maryland, Delaware, and representatives of healthcare providers. These declarations detailed irreparable harms already suffered, including widespread fear and disenrollment from Medicaid programs among immigrant communities; reduced use of necessary emergency and preventive healthcare services; and substantial financial burdens on healthcare providers and states due to uncompensated care and lost federal funding.\n\nOn July 14, the parties stipulated to expedite briefing on the preliminary injunction, and the court scheduled oral argument for August 7, 2025. On August 12, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 2356224. At the outset, it noted that there did not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, and that several federal statutes appeared to permit, and sometimes even require, such disclosures. Nonetheless, in light of existing, longstanding ICE policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement, and reliance on that policy by states, providers, and patients, \"it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them.\"\u00a0 The record in this case suggested that no such process occurred, and that the defendants did not consider important policy tradeoffs before making the challenged changes. Thus, the court concluded that, on the record before it, the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d claim under the APA, which would require HHS and DHS to go back and engage in a reasoned decisionmaking process.\u00a0 Moreover, the states were likely to suffer irreparable harm from the way the agencies implemented the change, and the balance of hardships and public interest further warranted preliminary relief. The court therefore preliminarily enjoined DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data already acquired from CMS, and preliminarily enjoined HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. The preliminary injunction was to remain in place until the shorter of: (1) the termination of this litigation; or (2) 14 days after both DHS and HHS have completed a reasoned decisionmaking process or rulemaking, if necessary. The court declined, however, to require the agencies to undertake notice and comment rulemaking, holding that the states had not demonstrated that such rulemaking was required. It noted that this was without prejudice to re-raising the issue later. It further noted its skepticism on the merits of the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, but denied it as moot in light of the ruling under the APA which would enable the agencies to consider the Spending Clause issue as part of the reasoned decisionmaking process.\n\nThis case is ongoing."

            "summary_A": "This case is about the federal government\u2019s termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. On July 7, 2025, the National TPS Alliance and private plaintiffs who are individual TPS holders filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, and the United States under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Trina L. Thompson.\n\nThe complaint provided extensive background on the TPS program\u2019s purpose and statutory framework. Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace politically driven discretionary programs like \u201cextended voluntary departure\u201d with decisions based on clear humanitarian standards. TPS designations confer work authorization and protection from deportation. By statute, the Secretary must review country conditions before terminating any designation, with extensions effectively the default absent timely notice. Honduras and Nicaragua were designated in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch; Nepal in 2015 after a major earthquake. These designations were repeatedly extended due to ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, DHS announced TPS terminations between 2017 and 2018, affecting over 400,000 people. Federal courts blocked those terminations, finding they stemmed from a predetermined agenda to end TPS and were tainted by discriminatory animus against non-white immigrants. DHS rescinded those terminations in 2023.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the second Trump administration renewed this agenda under Executive Order 14159, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which directed DHS to rescind prior TPS-related policies and prioritize the removal of non-citizens. Plaintiffs asserted that Secretary Noem\u2019s TPS terminations were preordained, based on a superficial review, and motivated by racial and national-origin animus, citing public statements by Noem, President Trump, and Vice President Vance. Plaintiffs challenged the truncated 60-day transition period\u2014the minimum statutory notice before TPS termination became effective, a significant departure from historical practice\u2014as violating the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and alleged that DHS breached statutory requirements and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nRepresented by nonprofit immigrant rights attorneys, plaintiffs sought an injunction barring DHS from enforcing the terminations and an order maintaining TPS protections. They also sought to have the court set aside, postpone, or stay the terminations, enjoin enforcement, and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Thompson granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expedite briefing and hearing on their request to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025. In its order, the court wrote, \u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.\u201d\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the TPS terminations were preordained and not based on an objective assessment of country conditions. The court cited comments made by Secretary Noem before she reviewed any country conditions reports, which suggested a predetermined intent to end the TPS program. The court also found that the terminations failed to address data previously considered relevant, including political violence and crime in Honduras and recurring weather events in Nicaragua. The court determined that terminating TPS would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of postponement. Judge Thompson concluded that the court had jurisdiction to review the case and that the requested relief to postpone the terminations fell within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the court\u2019s July 31 order. The defendants argued that they were likely to prevail on appeal, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Noem v. National TPS Alliance, No. 25 cv 1766 EMC (N.D. Cal.), where the district court had erroneously concluded that the Secretary\u2019s action vacating a prior extension of TPS for certain Venezuelans exceeded her statutory authority. The defendants also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because the TPS statute explicitly barred judicial review of any decision to terminate a TPS designation. The defendants further argued that the balance of harms favored a stay, asserting that the government suffered irreparable harm when its policies were enjoined. Finally, the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants appealed the July 31 order to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On July 7, 2025, the National TPS Alliance, a member-led organization representing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, along with seven individual TPS holders from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the UCLA School of Law's Center for Immigration Law and Policy, the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, and Haitian Bridge Alliance. The individual plaintiffs are long-term residents of the United States, having lived lawfully in the country for at least ten years (Nepali plaintiffs) or twenty-six years (Honduran and Nicaraguan plaintiffs), without any felony or misdemeanor convictions. A motion for class certification was later filed on August 15, 2025.\n\nThe lawsuit names Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the United States of America as defendants. It challenges Secretary Noem's decisions to terminate TPS designations for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, which would affect approximately 60,000 individuals.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted three causes of action:\n1.  **Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)**: They alleged the terminations were \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706) because they were based on a preordained political agenda to end TPS, rather than an objective review of country conditions, and considered extra-statutory factors.\n2.  **Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)**: They claimed the Secretary's decision to provide only 60 days' notice before the terminations took effect constituted an unexplained and unacknowledged deviation from decades of agency practice, which typically provided at least a six-month orderly transition period for long-standing TPS designations.\n3.  **Violation of the Equal Protection Guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment**: They alleged the termination decisions were motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin, citing public statements by the Secretary and the President.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the terminations and the 60-day notice period were unlawful, an order to set aside the terminations, a postponement or stay of their effective dates, an injunction preventing their enforcement, and an award of attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Trina L. Thompson. Related cases referenced in the proceedings include *Bhattarai v. Nielsen*, *Ramos v. Nielsen* (including *Ramos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2020)*, which was later vacated en banc, and *Ramos v. Nielsen, 709 F. Supp. 3d 871 (N.D. Cal. 2023)*), and *Nat\u2019l TPS All. v. Noem, 2025 WL 957677 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2025)*, referred to as NTPSA I, which was subject to a U.S. Supreme Court stay in *Noem v. Nat. TPS All., 2025 WL 1427560 (U.S. May 19, 2025)*.\n\nOn July 8, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion to postpone the effective date of the agency action. On July 31, 2025, Judge Thompson issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion to postpone. The court found that it had jurisdiction to review the claims, rejecting the defendants' arguments that statutory provisions (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254a(b)(5) and 1252(f)(1)) stripped its authority. The judge determined that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of all three claims, citing evidence that the terminations were preordained, deviated from past practice without justification, and were motivated by racial animus, as reflected in the administration's \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion\" Executive Order and public statements. The court also found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without postponement and that the balance of harms and public interest favored maintaining the TPS designations. The order postponed the effective date of the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, preserving the status quo until a hearing on the merits scheduled for November 18, 2025, subject to extension.\n\nFollowing this, on August 1, 2025, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the postponement order pending an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The defendants argued the court lacked jurisdiction, was likely to be reversed on the merits, and that the balance of harms favored allowing the terminations to proceed, referencing the Supreme Court's stay in NTPSA I. On August 8, 2025, Judge Thompson denied the defendants' motion to stay, reiterating her previous findings on jurisdiction, the likelihood of plaintiffs' success on the merits, and the balance of harms. She also rejected the defendants' argument for narrowing the stay to only the named plaintiffs, finding it impractical and potentially unconstitutional. On the same day, the defendants filed an emergency motion in the Ninth Circuit for a stay pending appeal."

            "summary_A": "A non-partisan government watchdog organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), filed a lawsuit on April 4, 2025, against the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its Acting Director Susan Monarez, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and its Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (collectively, the federal health agencies). The individual defendants were sued in their official capacities. CREW is represented by its own counsel.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from the abrupt elimination of the CDC's entire Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office on April 1, 2025. All CDC FOIA staff were placed on administrative leave, halting the agency's FOIA work. This action was reportedly part of the Trump Administration's broader \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative, which led to mass firings across HHS. CREW alleged that this occurred amid an ongoing measles outbreak and serious public questions about the administration's preparedness and transparency regarding public health crises, including reports that CDC suppressed a measles forecast assessment.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, CREW submitted five expedited FOIA requests to the CDC. One sought records concerning the alleged suppression of the measles assessment, while the other four requested records related to the decision to close the CDC FOIA office, the involvement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in that decision, and the federal health agencies' plans for future FOIA compliance. CREW received automated email responses indicating the CDC FOIA office was non-operational.\n\nCREW's complaint alleged violations of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, et seq.). The organization sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including an order to compel expedited processing of its FOIA requests, to enjoin the federal health agencies' policy or practice of FOIA non-compliance, and to declare unlawful and set aside the closure of the CDC FOIA office as arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly. On April 21, 2025, CREW filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Partial Summary Judgment. The federal health agencies opposed the motion. During this period, on May 1, 2025, the HHS Office of the Secretary (OS-FOIA) acknowledged CREW's requests, granting expedited processing for the measles-related request but denying it for the other four. The federal health agencies stated that OS-FOIA would centralize and process all FOIA requests for CDC and other HHS components moving forward.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 13, 2025, Judge Kelly denied CREW's Motion for Preliminary Injunction on June 4, 2025. The court's Memorandum Opinion (2025 WL 4218003) found that CREW failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, a prerequisite for preliminary injunctive relief. The court reasoned that the requested records were not so time-sensitive as to lose their value without expedited processing, and any harm to CREW's broad organizational mission of government oversight was not irreparable. The court noted that while the federal health agencies' actions raised serious questions about the legality of the FOIA process overhaul, this was insufficient for preliminary relief.\n\nAfter the denial of the preliminary injunction, CREW filed a First Amended Complaint on June 25, 2025. On July 17, 2025, CREW filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Subsequently, the federal health agencies filed a Motion to Stay or for Extension of Time on August 13, 2025. Judge Kelly denied the motion to stay on August 19, 2025, but granted a limited extension for summary judgment briefing. On August 26, 2025, the federal health agencies filed joint motions to stay dispositive briefing on Count I of the Amended Complaint (wrongful withholding of records) and to modify the briefing deadlines for the remaining counts. Judge Kelly granted these joint motions on August 27, 2025, staying briefing on Count I and modifying the schedule for the other claims. As of the last available record, no trial or settlement has occurred, and no monitor has been appointed.",

The FOIA requests sought, per CREW\u2019s complaint, \u201crecords regarding the agency\u2019s staff reductions and other matters of significant public interest\u201d\u2014including an ongoing, national measles outbreak. To see the Clearinghouse\u2019s coverage of other litigation against the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../collections/38759].\n\nHHS disbanded the CDC\u2019s FOIA office and placed the office\u2019s staff on administrative leave following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) March 27, 2025 announcement that it would cut 20,000 full-time employees\u2014reducing the workforce from 82,000 to 62,000\u2014in what the agency called \u201ca dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, \u2018Implementing the President\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" Workforce Optimization Initiative\u2019\u201d (EO 14210) (see the HHS press release, here [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html]). EO 14210 included the directive: \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, 2025, CREW, a non-partisan government watchdog organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW named the CDC, HHS, and the heads of those departments as defendants. Represented by in-house attorneys, CREW sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff claimed that the abrupt elimination of the CDC\u2019s entire FOIA office violated federal law and blocked public access to critical government records on issues of national importance\u2014including \u201congoing outbreaks . . . of measles and other highly contagious diseases.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants: violated FOIA by wrongfully denying expedited processing of CREW\u2019s FOIA requests; had a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of violating FOIA; and violated the APA by taking unlawful, arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nCREW asked the court to declare the agency\u2019s actions unlawful, enjoin the government from continuing to block FOIA operations, and compel expedited processing of CREW's pending requests. The organization also sought attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, on which the court held argument on May 13. The plaintiffs requested partial summary judgment on their claims that the CDC violated FOIA and that its actions were contrary to law under the APA, but not on their arbitrary and capricious argument. The plaintiffs argued that briefing on both motions could take place simultaneously, since there were no disputed factual issues with regard to those issues, and claimed that \"expeditious final disposition will benefit CREW and the public so that they can be assured of access to the vital information at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, finding that plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm in the absence of relief. CREW had suggested two theories: First, CREW argued that without fast processing of its information requests, \"it w[ould] be unable to give the public important information relevant to ongoing debates about measles and transparency within HHS and CDC.\" Second, CREW argued that if the CDC continued to ignore FOIA requests, given CREW's reliance on FOIA to obtain information for the public, CREW would suffer irreparable harm to its \"organizational mission.\" The court rejected both arguments. On the first, the court found that \"CREW has not shown that the records will imminently lose significant value without a preliminary injunction,\" meaning that any harm suffered would not be irreparable. As for the second argument, the court found on the record before it \"any harm to CREW\u2019s organizational mission caused by HHS\u2019s FOIA overhaul is not irreparable harm under FOIA.\" Therefore, the court denied the motion.\n\nOn June 17, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court ordered an expedited schedule for the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment, as well as a government opposition or cross-motion, and extended the time to answer the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 25. The amended complaint expanded on the factual and legal allegations regarding FOIA and how the CDC's failure to provide information violates the statute. The complaint also added additional detail on the current status of the CDC's current FOIA operations, noting that the office is not currently fulfilling its responsibilities. The complaint also removed the plaintiffs' arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA and the corresponding request for declaratory relief under the APA. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on July 17, arguing that they were entitled to summary judgment on their claims that the CDC had a \"policy or practice\" of FOIA noncompliance, and that the closure of CDC's FOIA office was contrary to law under the APA.\n\nThis case is ongoing."

            "summary_A": "This case challenged the termination of a $6 million award under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (Board). On February 14, 2025, the Department of Education (DOE), by and through its Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, issued a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) threatening schools and colleges across the country with the loss of federal funding if these education institutions continued to pursue ambiguously defined \"DEI programs\" that \"teach students that certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not\" and/or \"stigmatize students who belong to racial groups.\" The Department of Education canceled the grants to the Board on April 29, 2025, announcing that the grants \"violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; conflict with the Department\u2019s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.\"\n\nThe Board sued on June 20, 2025, in the District Court for the District of New Mexico. The Board alleged that the termination of the grants violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and violated the Spending Clause. The Board also claimed that the termination was void for vagueness, was ultra vires, and was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Board asked the court to declare the DOE's actions unlawful and to enjoin the DOE from terminating the grants.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge William P. Johnson. On June 23, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), or in the alternative, for a preliminary injunction barring the defendants from terminating the Board's grants.\n\nJudge Johnson denied the plaintiffs' motion on July 21 and dismissed the case without prejudice. The court first found that the plaintiffs' claims were, in essence, contract claims that belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. \"The non-continuation of Plaintiff\u2019s grant funding is the type of contract claim that gives rise to Tucker Act jurisdiction.\" \"Rather than challenging a regulatory action with some monetary implications, Plaintiff seeks payment of 'the grant monies' it claims entitlement to,\" which is the essence of a contract claim.\n\nThe court also conducted a preliminary injunction analysis on the supposition that the case was not one that belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. The court held that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court ruled that \"discontinuation of grant money does not infringe on free speech because Defendants\u2019 actions do not prohibit or compel private speech.\" Turning to the Due Process claim, the court said that the plaintiffs had \"not identified a protected property or liberty interest in a continuation of the grant funding (which is fatal to the void-for-vagueness due process claim).\"\n\nThe court also rejected the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, since under the statutory framework, the Secretary is required to determine whether the continuation of the grant is in the \"best interests of the Federal Government.\" The Secretary made that determination here, and the decision to terminate the plaintiffs' grant was within that discretion. This discretion also doomed the plaintiffs' ultra vires claim, since the defendants did not act outside of their authority. Finally, on the plaintiffs' APA claims, the court held that the defendants' decision on how to allocate a grant award \"seems like a quintessential decision committed to agency discretion by law,\" meaning that it would not be reviewable under the APA.\n\nBased on these findings, the court said that the plaintiffs could not succeed on their request for preliminary injunction, given that they were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. Therefore, the court rejected the plaintiffs' request and, based on its holding that the claims were contractual in nature, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools, a public school district in New Mexico, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico against the U.S. Department of Education, the Secretary of Education (Linda McMahon), and the President of the United States (Donald J. Trump), all sued in their official capacities. The School District was represented by private counsel.\n\nThe dispute arose after the Department of Education, pursuant to a series of executive orders and agency directives issued in early 2025, discontinued a previously awarded $6 million federal grant for mental health services. This grant, distributed over five years, was part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, a federal statute enacted in response to school shootings to fund, among other things, expanded access to school-based mental health services. The Department\u2019s April 29, 2025, notice informed the School District that its grant would not be continued beyond the current budget period, citing new federal policy priorities and alleged conflicts with federal civil rights laws, particularly in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) programming.\n\nThe School District alleged that the Department\u2019s actions violated multiple federal statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and several constitutional provisions. Specifically, the School District claimed violations of the First Amendment (free speech and association), the Fifth Amendment (due process and vagueness), and the Spending Clause of Article I, Section 8. The District contended that the Department\u2019s termination of the grant was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and was not in accordance with law. The School District sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including reinstatement of the grant funding, a halt to enforcement of the Department\u2019s new Dear Colleague Letter (\u201cDCL\u201d) and related guidance, and reimbursement for expenditures incurred during the period of grant suspension.\n\nJudge William P. Johnson presided over the case. The School District promptly moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the loss of funding and to halt implementation of the Department\u2019s new DEI-related policies. The Department opposed, arguing both on the merits and on jurisdictional grounds.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson denied the motion for preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that the School District\u2019s claims, though framed as constitutional and statutory challenges, were fundamentally contractual in nature\u2014seeking to enforce a right to payment under a federal grant. Under the Tucker Act, such claims must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not federal district court. The court further held that even if the case were properly before it, the School District had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm, as required for injunctive relief. The court noted recent Supreme Court and appellate precedent confirming that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of money under the APA where the claim is, in essence, contractual. The dismissal was without prejudice, allowing the School District to pursue its claims in the appropriate forum.\n\nThe court did not issue any substantive ruling on the merits of the School District\u2019s constitutional or statutory claims, nor did it reach the question of whether the Department\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful under the APA. No reported opinions were issued aside from the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion (see 25-cv-586-WJ-GBW, July 18, 2025). No trial was held, and no appeal is noted in the record. No settlement, decree, or court-ordered monitoring occurred. The factual basis of the case centered on the School District\u2019s reliance on federal mental health grant funding, the Department\u2019s abrupt policy reversal and termination of funding based on new executive directives, and the significant impact on school-based mental health services in the district."

            "summary_A": "This case was initially filed on July 18, 2025, by two individual plaintiffs: Johanna Foods, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, and Johanna Beverage Company, LLC, a Washington corporation. These food manufacturers, leading producers and distributors of fruit juices, drinks, and yogurts, are represented by private counsel. They sued the Executive Office of the President of the United States, the United States of America, the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency and its Acting Commissioner Pete R. Flores, the Office of the United States Trade Representative and its U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and the Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction, to prevent the defendants from imposing and enforcing certain tariffs. They also sought monetary damages for any tariffs collected and attorneys' fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Their cause of action alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (50 U.S.C. \u00a71701 et seq.) and the U.S. Constitution (specifically Article I, Section 8, regarding the unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the President), citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a72483 and 3 U.S.C. \u00a7301 as statutory bases.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on two executive actions:\n1.  **Executive Order No. 14257 (April 2, 2025)**: This order, referred to as the \"Trade Deficit Tariff,\" imposed a 10% ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners, including Brazil. It declared a national emergency based on U.S. goods trade deficits and non-reciprocal tariff rates.\n2.  **President's Letter to Brazil (July 9, 2025)**: This letter, referred to as the \"Brazil Letter,\" purported to impose a 50% tariff on \"any and all Brazilian products\" (the \"Brazil Tariff\") starting August 1, 2025. The letter cited Brazil's treatment of its former president, alleged attacks on free elections and free speech, and a \"longstanding, and very unfair trade relationship\" as reasons, but did not reference any specific statutory authority or declare a national emergency.\n\nThe plaintiffs, highly reliant on imported not from concentrate orange juice (NFCOJ) from Brazil, alleged that these tariffs would cause immediate and irreparable harm. They contended that Brazil is their sole supplier of NFCOJ, and domestic orange production in the U.S. has declined over 95% in 25 years, making Brazilian imports critical. They estimated the 50% tariff would add at least $68 million in costs annually, exceeding their historical profits and threatening business viability, layoffs for approximately 700 American employees, and a 20-25% increase in consumer orange juice prices. They also highlighted that the U.S. has a goods trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit, rendering the Trade Deficit Tariff's rationale inapplicable to Brazil. The plaintiffs referenced a prior ruling, *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, 772 F.Supp.3d 1350 (2025)*, in support of their legal arguments against the Trade Deficit Tariff.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a motion for preliminary and/or permanent injunction. Judge Timothy M. Reif, who is presiding over the case, ordered the defendants to respond to the TRO motion by July 29, 2025. On July 29, 2025, Judge Reif denied the plaintiffs' application for a TRO, finding that they had not clearly shown a likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm occurring before the imposition of the threatened Brazil Tariff, particularly as the Brazil Letter did not constitute a final, legally binding executive action. The court also declined to consider arguments related to the Trade Deficit Tariff because it was not explicitly challenged in the complaint. The case was subsequently stayed pending final, unappealable decisions in two related cases on appeal to the Federal Circuit: *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States*, Appeal No. 2025-1812, and *Oregon v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Security*, Appeal No. 2025-1813.",
            "summary_B": "This case challenges the imposition of a 50% tariff on Brazilian orange juice imports.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14257, establishing a 10% ad valorem duty on all imports. Subsequently, on April 9, 2025, Executive Order 14266 paused elevated tariffs for most countries for 90 days while maintaining the 10% global tariff. After extending certain tariff suspensions until August 1, 2025, President Trump issued a letter on July 9, 2025, imposing a 50% tariff on all Brazilian products entering the United States, effective August 1, 2025. The Trump administration justified the tariff based on concerns about Brazil\u2019s treatment of former President Bolsonaro, alleged attacks on free elections and free speech in the United States, and an allegedly unfair trade relationship.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Johanan Foods, Inc. and Johanna Beverage Company, LLC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the Executive Office of the President, the United States, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) and its Acting Commissioner, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Secretary of Commerce, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trade Act of 1974. Judge Timothy M. Reif presides over the case.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that IEEPA does not grant the President statutory authority to impose the tariff, that President Trump failed to identify a national emergency or an \"unusual or extraordinary threat\" from outside the United States as required by IEEPA, and that Congress unconstitutionally delegated power to the President. They also sought injunctive relief to block enforcement of Executive Order 14257 and the Brazil letter, as well as damages for any collected tariffs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that the tariff lacked a valid legal basis, was not issued through a proper executive order, and was unsupported by any declared national emergency or qualifying threat under IEEPA. They contended that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs aimed at political objectives or countries with which the U.S. maintains a trade surplus, such as Brazil. They also claimed the tariff exceeded the 15% cap and 150-day limit set by Section 122 of the Trade Act. They warned of severe economic harm, including at least $68 million in annual costs, the potential loss of nearly 700 American jobs, and a 20\u201325% increase in consumer orange juice prices due to their exclusive reliance on Brazilian imports and a sharp decline in domestic supply.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the tariff. Plaintiffs also sought summary judgment for a permanent injunction. They argued that the tariff would inflict immediate and irreparable harm, including tens of millions in added annual costs, sharp retail price increases, and potential layoffs, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored immediate injunctive relief.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, Judge Reif denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, finding they had not clearly demonstrated a likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm before the threatened tariff. The court observed that the July 9 letter announcing the \u201cBrazil Tariff\u201d was not an executive order, proclamation, or other form of legally binding executive action. Accordingly, the court determined that neither the President nor any agency had taken \u201cfinal action that is subject to judicial review.\u201d The court further reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged harm was \u201chypothetical or speculative\u201d because it rested on an action that \u201cmay or may not occur,\u201d citing legal precedent that speculative harm does not warrant judicial intervention. Finally, the court stayed the case pending a final, unappealable decision in two related matters: V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, Case No. 25-00066 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade), and Oregon v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, Case No. 25-00077 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade).\n\nThis case is ongoing."

            "summary_A": "On May 10, 2025, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other legal services organizations filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a Venezuelan national and all other noncitizens detained in the Western District of Texas who were subject to a March 2025 Presidential Proclamation. The Proclamation invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (AEA) to authorize the summary removal of Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) criminal gang. The petitioners sued various U.S. government officials and agencies, including the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and wardens of federal detention centers.\n\nThe lawsuit sought a writ of habeas corpus along with declaratory and injunctive relief. The petitioners argued that the Proclamation was an unlawful use of a wartime statute during peacetime. Their claims were based on several grounds: the TdA is a criminal gang, not a \"foreign nation or government,\" and its activities do not constitute a military \"invasion or predatory incursion\" as required by the AEA; the Proclamation illegally bypasses the comprehensive removal procedures and humanitarian protections established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), such as the right to seek asylum or protection under the Convention Against Torture; and the process violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by failing to provide adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity for individuals to challenge their designation as TdA members.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge David Briones in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. On May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) preventing the government from removing or transferring the petitioners under the Proclamation. On May 22, 2025, the court certified the class action. The complaint referenced several related challenges to the Proclamation in other federal courts, including *J.G.G. v. Trump* and *Sanchez Puentes v. Garite*.\n\nAfter consolidating a preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits, Judge Briones issued a final ruling on June 9, 2025. The court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding the Proclamation unlawful on its face. The opinion held that the Proclamation failed to meet the statutory requirements of the AEA, violated the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantees, and unlawfully conflicted with the INA.\n\nThe court entered a permanent injunction with several key terms:\n*   The government is permanently enjoined from removing any class member from the United States pursuant to the Proclamation.\n*   The government is enjoined from transferring class members out of the Western District of Texas during the pendency of their habeas proceedings without advance notice to counsel.\n*   The court further declared that even if the Proclamation were lawful, due process would require the government to provide individuals with at least 30 days' notice of their designation as an alien enemy, in a language they understand, and inform them of their right to seek judicial review and consult with an attorney.\n\nOn July 16, 2025, the government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.",
            "summary_B": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38953&ordering=-summary_approved_date]. This case was also certified related to Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al. [../../../../case/46501/]. \u00a0Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.\n\nThis petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TRP) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.\n\nOn May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order\u2014prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys\u2014while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.\n\nOn May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.\n\nThe next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.\n\nThe court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.\n\nFinding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.\n\nThe case is ongoing."

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought to block the DOL's recent decision to shut down all privately operated Job Corps centers nationwide.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that beginning in March 2025, the DOL took a series of steps to dismantle the Job Corps program\u2014a congressionally mandated residential career training program for disadvantaged youth\u2014culminating in stop-work orders and contract termination notices issued on May 29, 2025. The plaintiffs claimed these actions were an unlawful attempt to eliminate the program. The causes of action were brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging the DOL's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its statutory authority under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). The complaint also alleged the DOL's actions constituted an illegal impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds and violated the constitutional separation of powers. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the shutdown.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr. On June 4, 2025, one day after the complaint was filed, Judge Carter granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, immediately pausing the shutdown of the Job Corps centers.\n\nFollowing a hearing, on June 25, 2025, the court issued an opinion and order granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Carter found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the DOL's contract terminations were functionally a \"closure\" of the centers. As such, the DOL was required to follow specific statutory procedures mandated by Congress for center closures, including public notice and a comment period, which the department admittedly failed to do. The court initially issued a nationwide injunction, prohibiting the DOL from enforcing the shutdown, removing students, or taking any further action to eliminate the program without congressional authorization. The injunction noted a related case, *Cabrera v. U.S. Department of Labor*, was pending in the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs were ordered to post a $200,000 bond.\n\nFollowing a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting the use of universal injunctions, Judge Carter held another oral argument. On July 24, 2025, the court issued an amended order that narrowed the scope of the preliminary injunction. The modified injunction now applies specifically to the 31 centers operated by the plaintiff companies and five additional centers where the plaintiff union provides training services, rather than all centers nationwide. The case is ongoing under the terms of the amended preliminary injunction.",
            "summary_B": "This case challenged multiple actions taken by the Department of Labor (DOL) to shut down the Job Corps. The Job Corps trains and educates disadvantaged young people with additional career and technical instruction in order to assist them in attaining and retaining employment. Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants\u2019 decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court\u2019s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing."

The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled \u201cContinuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.\u00a0 After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. \u00a7 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.\u00a7 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. \u00a7 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. \u00a7 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA), a national nonprofit membership organization representing libraries and librarians, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME), a major public sector labor union representing library and museum workers, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit was brought against federal officials and agencies, including the Acting Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the IMLS itself, the President of the United States, officials in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and related entities. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel, including Democracy Forward Foundation and Gair Gallo Eberhard LLP.\n\nThe case arises from actions taken by the executive branch following the issuance of Executive Order 14238, \u201cContinuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\u201d signed by President Donald Trump on March 14, 2025. This executive order directed IMLS and other agencies to reduce their activities and staffing to the minimum required by law, with the stated intent to eliminate the agency as much as possible. Following the order, Keith Sonderling was installed as Acting Director of IMLS. The agency\u2019s staff was placed on administrative leave, and most were subsequently terminated; only a small number of employees remained. IMLS began terminating federal grants to libraries and related organizations, and all members of the National Museum and Library Services Board were dismissed. Plaintiffs alleged that these actions resulted in the cancellation of grants, disruption of library services nationwide, and loss of resources and data collection essential to libraries and their users.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged these actions on multiple grounds, including violations of the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause of Article II, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They claimed that the executive branch lacked authority to unilaterally dismantle an agency established by Congress, that the actions violated statutory mandates under the Museum and Library Services Act, and that the termination of grants and staff was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction and, later, a temporary restraining order to halt further dissolution of IMLS, reinstate staff and grants, and restore the agency\u2019s operations pending resolution of the case.\n\nJudge Richard J. Leon presided over the case. After briefing and a hearing, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order on June 6, 2025, denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits because the claims for reinstatement of grants and staff were, in substance, contract claims that fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. The court found that the relief sought\u2014reinstatement of terminated grants and staff\u2014amounted to requests for specific performance of government contracts, which cannot be granted by a district court under the APA. The court also noted that challenges to federal employment actions must proceed through the administrative channels established by the Civil Service Reform Act. As a result, the court denied the preliminary injunction and subsequent requests for emergency relief as moot.\n\nNo trial was held, and no reported opinions were issued. No settlement or consent decree was reached, and no monitor was appointed. The case remains pending, with the parties directed to propose next steps, including possible dispositive motion briefing.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centered on the executive branch\u2019s attempt to dismantle IMLS by terminating its staff and grants, which plaintiffs alleged caused immediate and ongoing harm to libraries, library workers, and the services they provide to the public. The court\u2019s ruling rested on jurisdictional grounds, without reaching the merits of the constitutional or statutory claims."

            "summary_A": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt termination of immigration visas\u2014mostly student or work visas\u2014with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 22, 2025, twelve international students and graduates on F-1 visas and post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of San Francisco. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was initially assigned to Judge P. Casey Pitts, but reassigned to Judge Steven White on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that between April 4 and 8, 2025, the defendants abruptly terminated their F-1 visas and records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively stripping them of their ability to remain students in the United States. The stated reason was \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d and that they had been \u201cidentified in a criminal records check and/or had their visa revoked.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that they had fully complied with the terms of their F-1 status and engaged in no conduct warranting termination. They argued that the SEVIS terminations and subsequent visa revocations appeared to be part of a policy intended to coerce international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 statuses, and protection from enforcement or deportation. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from detaining or transferring them during the proceedings. The plaintiffs did not challenge the visa revocations, arguing that F-1 status could remain valid despite revocation.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting or transferring the named plaintiffs or enforcing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS records or potential F-1 visa revocations until May 15, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had shown \"at least serious questions exist\" on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 distinction between an active SEVIS record and lawful F-1 status, noting that terminating a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status. The order described the defendants\u2019 \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative,\u201d in which ICE terminated thousands of SEVIS records based on criminal database checks and a State Department request, and noted a new policy listing visa revocation as a reason for termination. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals, from imposing adverse legal effects from SEVIS terminations, and from reversing reinstated SEVIS records of individuals maintaining their status without court approval.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. They argued that the injunction exceeded the court\u2019s authority as a nationwide order, citing Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm because ICE had already reactivated SEVIS records retroactively. They also contended that the injunction was vague and overbroad, restricting lawful enforcement and exposing DHS officers to contempt, and improperly limited their authority to terminate SEVIS records unrelated to the \u201cStudent Criminal Alien Initiative.\u201d\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the injunction\u2019s nationwide scope, its bar on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to SEVIS termination, and its restriction on terminating SEVIS records outside the Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, and denied, in part, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal. \u00a0The court upheld the universal scope of the injunction, finding that Trump v. CASA did not bar nationwide relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and concluded that the defendants had not shown irreparable harm. The court modified the arrest and transfer provisions, allowing arrests only if based on new material information unrelated to the SEVIS terminations, but denied any modification to the reversal provision, maintaining that defendants cannot reverse reinstated SEVIS records without court approval.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 22, 2025, a group of twelve international students and recent graduates on F-1 visas filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. President and senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The students, represented by private counsel, alleged that the federal government had unlawfully terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database used to track their immigration status.\n\nThe lawsuit was initiated after the students received notice in early April 2025 that their SEVIS records were terminated for \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status,\" with the reason cited as being \"identified in a criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\" The students contended that none of them had a criminal history that would constitute a failure to maintain F-1 status under federal law. Their law enforcement contacts consisted of minor infractions, arrests that did not lead to conviction, or expunged misdemeanors, none of which provided a legal basis for termination. The complaint alleged that the government's actions, part of a \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and were carried out without prior notice or an opportunity to be heard, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The students sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate the terminations and restore their legal status.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and handled alongside several related cases filed by other students facing the same issue. On April 23, 2025, the students filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent their arrest or removal. On April 25, 2025, Judge White granted the TRO, temporarily enjoining the government from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the named plaintiffs, or imposing any other legal consequences based on the SEVIS terminations.\n\nShortly after the TRO was issued, the government began reinstating the terminated SEVIS records for the plaintiffs and thousands of other affected students nationwide, stating the reinstatements were retroactive. Despite this, on May 22, 2025, Judge White granted the students' motion for a preliminary injunction, extending the protections nationwide to all \"similarly situated individuals.\" The preliminary injunction, reported at *Doe v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1467543, enjoined the government from: (1) arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the students based on the terminations; (2) imposing any adverse legal effects from the terminations; and (3) reversing the SEVIS reinstatements for students maintaining their status for reasons not specified in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.1, without prior court approval.\n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025. Subsequently, on August 8, 2025, the government moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending the appeal. On August 22, 2025, Judge White granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court denied the request to stay the nationwide scope of the injunction and the provision restricting future SEVIS terminations. However, the court modified the injunction's prohibition on arrests and transfers, clarifying that the government is only enjoined from taking such actions based on the original, now-vacated SEVIS terminations, not for new and independent legal reasons. The modified nationwide injunction remains in effect while the appeal is pending."

            "summary_A": "On April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a union representing approximately 18,000 members of the U.S. Foreign Service, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit, brought by private and in-house counsel, named as defendants the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the heads of those agencies in their official capacities.\n\nThe case challenges Executive Order 14,251, issued on March 27, 2025. The order invoked a national security provision of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4103(b)) to exclude all subdivisions of the State Department and USAID from the statute\u2019s collective bargaining protections. This action effectively eliminated collective bargaining rights for Foreign Service members at those agencies. Following the order, OPM issued implementation guidance, and the State Department terminated its collective bargaining agreement with AFSA, ceased payroll deductions for union dues, revoked official time for union representatives, and ordered AFSA to vacate its government-provided offices.\n\nAFSA alleged that the President's action was *ultra vires* (beyond his legal authority), arguing that the statute only permits the exclusion of specific subdivisions, not the entirety of cabinet-level departments, which it claimed was tantamount to a repeal of the statute by executive fiat. AFSA further alleged that the order was not a bona fide national security determination but was instead unlawful retaliation for the union's public criticism of and litigation against the administration's policies, a violation of its First Amendment rights. As evidence, AFSA pointed to a White House \"Fact Sheet\" issued with the order that criticized \"hostile Federal unions\" for obstructing the President's agenda. The union sought declaratory and injunctive relief to nullify the executive order and restore its status and agreements.\n\nAFSA moved for a preliminary injunction. On May 14, 2025, Judge Paul L. Friedman granted the motion (2025 WL 1387331). He found that AFSA was likely to succeed on its claim that the President\u2019s action was *ultra vires*, reasoning that the administration had applied an overly broad interpretation of \"national security\" that was inconsistent with the statute's purpose. The injunction prohibited the defendants from implementing the executive order and required them to restore AFSA\u2019s recognition as the exclusive bargaining representative and honor all terms of its agreements.\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and moved to stay the injunction. After Judge Friedman denied the stay on June 17, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted the government\u2019s emergency motion for a stay pending appeal on June 20, 2025. The appellate court found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, that the injunction irreparably harmed the President\u2019s national security prerogatives, and that a stay was in the public interest. The case is related to *National Treasury Employees Union v. Trump*, which challenges a different section of the same executive order.",
            "summary_B": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing \u201cnational security\u201d as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain \u201cagency subdivisions\u201d within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d that described federal unions as \u201chostile\u201d and at \u201cwar\u201d with the President\u2019s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union\u2019s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA\u2019s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants\u2019 week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman\u2019s absence and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmense and irreparable injury\u201d without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union\u2019s core mission. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that \u201cforeign affairs are critical to national security,\u201d and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act\u2019s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President\u2019s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing."

            "summary_A": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:\u00a0\u00a0OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.\u00a0 The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.\u00a0 The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).\u00a0 On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.\u00a0 (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that\u00a0\u00a0\"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.\u00a0 On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.\u00a0 Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   \u2022 The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   \u2022 The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   \u2022 DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   \u2022 The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   \u2022 The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   \u2022 The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 28, 2025, a coalition of labor unions representing federal employees, non-profit organizations, and local governments filed suit in the Northern District of California challenging President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14210 and related federal actions. The plaintiffs included national and local unions (such as AFGE, AFSCME, SEIU and their locals), advocacy groups, and the governments of several major cities and counties. The suit was brought against President Trump, multiple federal agencies and their heads\u2014including OMB, OPM, the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d), and major Cabinet departments\u2014and was supported by private counsel and non-profit legal organizations.\n\nThe case arose after President Trump issued Executive Order 14210 on February 11, 2025, which initiated what he described as a \u201ccritical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy.\u201d The Order directed federal agencies to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law,\u201d and to submit to OMB reports discussing whether agencies or their subcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated. The Order prioritized RIFs in any agency function not mandated by statute or law, including offices or programs that the Administration chose to suspend or close, and referenced government shutdown staffing levels as a baseline. The President\u2019s stated goal was to eliminate what he characterized as waste and bloat in the federal workforce, and to reorganize, downsize, or eliminate agencies and functions according to his Administration\u2019s policy priorities, without prior Congressional authorization.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, OMB and OPM issued a Memorandum implementing the Order, requiring all agencies to submit Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans (\u201cARRPs\u201d) in two phases for OMB/OPM review and approval. The Memo required agencies to focus on the \u201cmaximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated,\u201d and to achieve significant reductions in staff and operations.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the President and his implementing agencies lacked constitutional and statutory authority to undertake or order such government-wide reorganizations and layoffs absent explicit Congressional approval. They contended that these actions usurped Congress\u2019s legislative powers under Article I, violated the separation of powers, and exceeded any authority delegated to the President or agencies under Article II or federal statutes. The Complaint also alleged that OMB, OPM, and DOGE acted ultra vires and that their directives and approvals violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding statutory authority, engaging in arbitrary and capricious action, and failing to provide notice and comment rulemaking. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including to enjoin further implementation of the Executive Order, the OMB/OPM Memo, and the ARRPs, and to vacate any actions taken under them.\n\nJudge Susan Illston granted a temporary restraining order on May 9, 2025, and, after further briefing and a hearing, a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Executive Order 14210 and its implementation were ultra vires and unconstitutional. The court held that, while the President may set policy priorities, large-scale executive branch reorganization and workforce reductions cannot lawfully occur without Congressional authorization. The court also found that OMB, OPM, and DOGE exceeded their authority by directing agencies to implement the President\u2019s Order, and that their actions likely violated the APA.\n\nThe injunction enjoined the President, OMB, OPM, DOGE, and 19 federal agencies (including major Cabinet departments and independent agencies) from taking any actions to implement or enforce Executive Order 14210, the OMB/OPM Memo, or ARRPs, including further approval of plans, issuance or execution of RIF notices, placement of employees on administrative leave, or transfer of functions between agencies. The court also ordered agencies to rescind any RIFs or administrative leave placements issued pursuant to the Order, but stayed that retrospective relief pending appeal. The court required plaintiffs to post a nominal bond of $10.\n\nDefendants appealed and sought an emergency stay in the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. The Ninth Circuit, in a published order, found that defendants had not shown irreparable harm and were not likely to succeed on the merits, holding that the President lacked authority to direct such sweeping reorganization without Congressional approval and that the agencies\u2019 actions exceeded their statutory authority. Judge Callahan dissented, arguing that the claims should have been channeled through the CSRA and that the President\u2019s actions were lawful exercises of executive authority.\n\nAt the time of the injunction, the record showed that agencies had begun implementing the Executive Order, including by issuing RIF notices that would have eliminated tens of thousands of positions across multiple agencies, closed entire offices, and transferred or consolidated functions\u2014often without regard to statutory mandates or Congressional funding. The court found that these actions, if not enjoined, would cause irreparable harm to federal employees, unions, local governments, and the public by undermining essential government services and violating the constitutional separation of powers. The case remains pending, with the preliminary injunction in effect and the government\u2019s appeal ongoing."

            "summary_A": "This case was a highly unusual federal criminal prosecution of a sitting state court judge\u2014who was alleged by the Trump Administration to have interfered with an immigration arrest. On April 24, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on two counts: (1) obstruction of a federal administrative proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, and (2) concealment of a person from arrest under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman and referred for pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Judge Dugan, while presiding over her courtroom in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on March 14, took steps to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers' arrest of a noncitizen criminal defendant under an immigration detainer. Federal prosecutors alleged that she challenged the agents\u2019 authority, directed them to speak with the chief judge, resumed the hearing off the record, and permitted the defendant to leave through a secure non-public exit. The government contended that these actions constituted deliberate obstruction of lawful federal enforcement efforts.\n\nJudge Dugan moved to dismiss the indictment on May 14. Represented by former U.S. attorneys and experienced criminal defense counsel, she argued that her alleged conduct was fully within the scope of her judicial duties and was protected by absolute judicial immunity. She contended that the charges violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment\u2019s federalism protections, and the longstanding principle that judicial acts\u2014especially those involving courtroom management\u2014cannot be criminalized. Her briefing drew heavily from Trump v. United States (2024), where the Supreme Court held that the President cannot be prosecuted for official acts, and argued that the same logic applied to judges. She also invoked constitutional avoidance and argued that the relevant criminal statutes could not be construed to reach judicial conduct without raising serious constitutional questions.\n\nAmici curiae briefs were filed on both sides. A coalition of 138 former federal and state judges moved to support dismissal, emphasizing the risk of chilling judicial independence and public trust. They argued that courtroom decision-making must be insulated from criminal sanction, and that accountability for judges is properly handled through appeal or state judicial conduct commissions. In response, the Center for American Rights filed an amicus brief arguing that public officials\u2014judges included\u2014are not immune from prosecution for obstructing justice, and that allowing immunity here would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nOn July 7, Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph issued a Report and Recommendation that recommended that the court deny the motion to dismiss. She concluded that no federal court had recognized absolute judicial immunity as a bar to criminal prosecution, rather than civil liability. While the alleged conduct may have occurred near or within the courtroom, she found that whether it was \"judicial in nature\" and immune from prosecution was not a question that could be resolved on the pleadings. The Report emphasized that judges have historically been held criminally liable for corruption or obstruction where warranted, citing precedents such as United States v. Claiborne and United States v. Joseph. She recommended that the case proceed to trial, with the motion to dismiss denied in full.\n\nOn July 22, Judge Dugan filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, reiterating her constitutional arguments and asserting that the magistrate failed to address controlling authority on judicial independence. On July 29, the government filed its response, urging the district court to adopt the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and allow the case to proceed to trial.\n\nAs of August 4, 2025, the district judge had not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss. The case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 24, 2025, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge, alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 (obstruction of proceedings before a federal agency) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071 (concealing a person to prevent discovery and arrest). The case arises from events on April 18, 2025, when federal immigration agents arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse to execute an administrative arrest warrant for an individual scheduled to appear before the judge in a state criminal case. According to the government, after learning of the agents\u2019 presence and their intent to arrest the individual, the judge confronted the agents in the public hallway, asserted that a judicial warrant was required, and directed the agents to leave the area and report to the Chief Judge\u2019s office. While the agents were away, the judge allegedly expedited the court proceedings off the record, then directed the defendant and his attorney to exit through a non-public door, enabling the individual to avoid immediate arrest. The individual was ultimately apprehended after exiting the courthouse.\n\nThe United States is represented by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The judge is represented by private counsel. The matter is not a class action.\n\nThe prosecution is based on alleged violations of federal criminal statutes\u2014specifically, obstruction of a federal agency\u2019s proceedings (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505) and concealing a person to prevent arrest (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071). The government seeks criminal penalties for these offenses.\n\nAfter indictment, the judge moved to dismiss the case, arguing that judicial immunity for official acts bars the prosecution, that the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism preclude federal prosecution of a state judge for judicial acts, and that the statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional concerns. The motion cited longstanding common law and Supreme Court precedents on judicial immunity, and recent Supreme Court decisions on official-acts immunity for executive officials.\n\nThe motion to dismiss was referred to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph, who issued a detailed report and recommendation on July 7, 2025. Judge Joseph concluded that, while judges are absolutely immune from civil liability for judicial acts, no binding authority extends that immunity to criminal prosecution for official acts, except where Congress has specifically authorized such prosecution (e.g., for civil rights violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242). The magistrate judge found that the indictment alleged conduct\u2014directing agents away, facilitating a defendant\u2019s exit to avoid arrest, and other affirmative acts\u2014that, if proven, could constitute criminal obstruction and concealment, regardless of whether those acts were performed in a judicial capacity. The magistrate judge also rejected the Tenth Amendment and constitutional avoidance arguments, holding that the issues raised were either not appropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss or unsupported by law.\n\nThe judge filed objections to the report and recommendation, reiterating arguments regarding judicial immunity, federalism, and statutory interpretation. The government responded, and on August 26, 2025, District Judge Lynn Adelman adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe case is now proceeding toward trial before Judge Adelman. No trial date has been set as of the latest docket entry. There are no reported opinions beyond the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (noted at Dkt. 43), and no consolidated or related cases. No settlement, consent decree, or court-appointed monitor is involved.\n\nThe underlying factual basis of the case centers on the judge\u2019s alleged actions in response to federal agents\u2019 attempt to arrest a noncitizen defendant at the courthouse, and whether those actions constituted criminal obstruction or concealment under federal law. The legal proceedings to date have focused on threshold questions of judicial immunity and federal authority, with the district court holding that these do not bar prosecution under the facts alleged."

            "summary_A": "On April 12, 2025, the ACLU and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network filed a class-action habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The petitioners are Venezuelan nationals held in civil immigration detention in Colorado who face summary removal from the United States under a recent presidential proclamation. The respondents are the U.S. government, including the President and officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice.\n\nThe case arose after the President, on March 14, 2025, invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798, a wartime statute, against alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan criminal gang. The proclamation designated Venezuelan nationals aged 14 and older who are alleged TdA members as \"Alien Enemies\" subject to immediate apprehension and removal, bypassing standard immigration procedures. The petitioners, who deny any affiliation with TdA, argue that this use of the AEA is unlawful. They contend the proclamation exceeds the statute's authority because a criminal gang is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and its activities do not constitute an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" as required by the AEA. They further allege that the summary removal process violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and their rights under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The lawsuit followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a related case, *Trump v. J.G.G.*, 2025 WL 102409, which held that challenges to the proclamation must be brought via individual habeas corpus petitions. The petitioners seek a writ of habeas corpus, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief to prevent their removal under the proclamation.\n\nFiled before Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney, the case saw immediate action. The petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO on the same day the case was initiated. On April 22, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted the TRO, provisionally certifying the class and barring the government from transferring class members out of the District of Colorado. The order also required the government to provide 21 days' notice before any removal under the proclamation, with the notice detailing the right to seek judicial review in a language the detainee understands (2025 WL 1163530).\n\nThe government immediately appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and sought an emergency stay. On April 29, 2025, the Tenth Circuit denied the stay, finding the government had not shown it would suffer irreparable harm (2025 WL 1233583). The government subsequently voluntarily dismissed this initial appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on May 6, 2025, Judge Sweeney issued two key orders. First, she formally granted the motion for class certification, defining the class as all noncitizens in custody in Colorado who are or will be subject to the proclamation. Second, she granted the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from detaining, transferring, or removing any class member from the District of Colorado under the authority of the AEA proclamation. The government filed a notice of appeal for both of these orders to the Tenth Circuit on July 7, 2025.",

The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was \u201cunder invasion\u201d by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was \u201csufficiently cohesive,\u201d and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought \u201cwould benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a \u201cinvasion\u201d under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.\u00a0 She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).\u00a0 In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals\u2014particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions\u2014outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded \u201cthere is a\u00a0 substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise\u2014despite [Petitioners\u2019] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.\u201d\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing."

The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.\n\nAlso on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.\n\nThe respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.\n\nFollowing the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:\n\nEnforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed.

The suit is a class action brought on behalf of all noncitizens in federal, state, or local custody in the Southern District of New York who are or will be subject to a March 2025 Presidential Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), and who have not received notice and a hearing as required by recent Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe respondents include the President of the United States, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, various federal immigration officials, and the director of the Orange County Correctional Facility. The case is presided over by Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of the Presidential Proclamation signed on March 14, 2025, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21-24, to authorize the immediate removal of Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. The Proclamation characterized TdA as perpetrating an \u201cinvasion or predatory incursion\u201d into the United States, thereby triggering the AEA\u2019s provisions. Under the government\u2019s implementation, individuals identified as TdA members, often based on physical characteristics or minimal evidence, were subject to summary removal without individualized notice or an opportunity to contest their designation. Many were removed to a prison in El Salvador, where, according to the plaintiffs, they faced indefinite detention and the risk of torture or inhumane conditions.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert causes of action under the AEA, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Convention Against Torture (as implemented by FARRA), the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, and the Suspension Clause. They seek a writ of habeas corpus, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification. Specifically, they argue that the AEA was unlawfully invoked in the absence of a declared war or genuine invasion by a foreign nation, that the Proclamation violates statutory and constitutional guarantees of due process, and that it bypasses protections for asylum seekers and those fearing persecution or torture.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Judge Hellerstein granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining the government from removing or transferring class members under the Proclamation without notice and a hearing. The class was certified as all noncitizens in federal, state, or local custody in the Southern District of New York subject to the Proclamation and lacking required notice and hearing, with notice to be provided in English and Spanish. The TRO was later amended and extended, and the class definition was broadened to include those in state or local custody.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, following briefing and a hearing, Judge Hellerstein issued a preliminary injunction. The court found that the AEA does not authorize removal absent a declared war or true invasion/predatory incursion by a foreign nation or government, and that the Proclamation\u2019s characterization of criminal activity by a gang did not meet this statutory threshold. The court further held that the Proclamation and its implementation violated both the procedural requirements of the AEA and the Due Process Clause, as individuals were not given adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to contest their designation as \u201calien enemies.\u201d The injunction enjoined enforcement of the Proclamation in the Southern District of New York and prohibited the removal or transfer of class members under its authority, except as permitted by regular immigration proceedings under the INA. The court did not require the plaintiffs to post a security bond.\n\nThe government\u2019s subsequent motion to decertify the class was denied, with the court emphasizing the appropriateness of class-wide habeas relief given the common legal and factual issues and the practical barriers faced by class members. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings or appeal. On July 3, 2025, the government filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, and further district court proceedings have been stayed pending appellate review.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and the case has not reached a final judgment. Significant related cases include the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003 (2025), which clarified the procedural rights of detainees under the AEA and established the requirement for notice and an opportunity to seek habeas relief before removal. No court-appointed monitor has been designated, and there is no settlement or consent decree in place. The case remains in active litigation, with the preliminary injunction as the operative court order."

            "summary_A": "On April 4, 2025, enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, its Secretary, and the United States of America. The plaintiffs, who include a rancher, a state senator, and operators of a cross-border tourism business, challenge a series of executive orders and proclamations issued in early 2025 that imposed significant tariffs on goods imported from Canada.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the tariffs, justified by the executive branch under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, are unconstitutional. The plaintiffs claim the executive actions usurp Congress's exclusive authority to regulate commerce and impose tariffs under Article I of the Constitution. They also assert that the tariffs violate their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and their historic, treaty-protected right to trade and travel across the U.S.-Canada border without duties, as recognized in the Jay Treaty of 1794. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, seek declaratory and injunctive relief to block the enforcement of the tariffs.\n\nThe federal defendants responded by filing a motion to transfer the case, arguing that the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over matters concerning tariffs and international trade law. On April 25, 2025, Judge Dana L. Christensen granted the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' claims fell squarely within the CIT's exclusive jurisdictional grant under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i). The court determined that challenges to tariffs imposed under the IEEPA and Section 232, as well as claims arising from the Jay Treaty, must be heard by the CIT to ensure national uniformity in trade law. The court vacated a scheduled hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately filed a notice of appeal of the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The district court subsequently denied the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction pending appeal, ruling it no longer had jurisdiction over the matter. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration of the transfer order. On June 2, 2025, Judge Christensen denied the motion for reconsideration, reaffirming the finding of exclusive CIT jurisdiction and noting that the CIT itself had asserted jurisdiction in similar tariff-related cases. The appeal of the transfer order remains pending before the Ninth Circuit.",
            "summary_B": "This case raises urgent questions about the scope of presidential authority over trade and the constitutional rights of Indigenous communities living along the U.S.\u2013Canada border. On April 4, 2025, two members of the Blackfeet Nation\u2014Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard\u2014filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs challenged a series of executive actions issued by President Donald Trump that imposed tariffs on goods entering from Canada. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cCanada Orders.\u201d These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys\u2019 fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing."

            "summary_A": "This case challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s actions to limit the Social Security Administration\u2019s ability to serve people with disabilities under the guise of bureaucratic \u201cefficiency.\u201d On April 2, 2025, plaintiffs\u2014American Association of People with Disabilities, National Federation of the Blind, DEAF Equality, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Massachusetts Senior Action Council, and private individuals\u2014filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Amit Priyavadan Mehta was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs sued the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk, and other acting heads of these administrative agencies. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt widespread service disruptions and the elimination of legally required civil rights protections.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 abrupt dismantling of SSA\u2019s operations caused irreparable harm to millions of disabled and elderly beneficiaries. They alleged that between January and March 2025, defendants orchestrated a sweeping rollback of services: eliminating the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), terminating the Office of Transformation, cutting 7,000 SSA employees, freezing hiring, and closing field offices. These changes, they argued, were ordered or heavily influenced by DOGE, a new federal entity created by Executive Order No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 29, 2025).\n\nExecutive Order 14158 established DOGE to \"modernize federal technology and software\" and to \"maximize governmental efficiency.\" It embedded DOGE teams within federal agencies and granted them sweeping access to internal operations and data. Plaintiffs argued that DOGE\u2019s directives had resulted in massive breakdowns in SSA\u2019s ability to deliver benefits, such as multi-hour phone hold times, crashed websites, inaccessible field offices, and termination of benefits for vulnerable individuals.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on April 2, 2025, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated the Rehabilitation Act for discriminatory removal of accommodations and civil rights protections. They also asserted APA violations for arbitrary and capricious restructuring without statutory authority and not in accordance with law. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted a First Amendment challenge, arguing that defendants' dissolution of OCREO\u2014the SSA grievance system\u2014unconstitutionally deprived them of their right to petition for redress. Finally, they argued that defendants violated the Take Care and Due Process clauses. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring further implementation of the DOGE-imposed reforms, restoration of OCREO and the Office of Transformation, reinstatement of staffing and telephone services, and court monitoring of SSA compliance. They also requested that the court declare the defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the same day, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the elimination of OCREA and the Office of Transformation within SSA, the revocation of the SSA offices, and the mass termination of SSA employees, and to roll back recent policies that increase applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 need to seek services in person. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction motion on April 16, arguing that (1) plaintiffs lacked standing, (2) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) their claims would fail on the merits. Plaintiffs responded on April 21, 2025, refuting all of defendants' arguments.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights. In their brief, amici argued that disruption to the SSA system had negative effects on Medicare recipients, which disproportionately impacted disabled individuals. On April 15, amici---the States of Connecticut, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia by state of Connecticut---also filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, determining plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that individual plaintiffs could not demonstrate \"life [or] death\" circumstances, and that plaintiff organizations could not prove in sufficient detail that they or their members were \"perceptibly impaired\" by defendants' actions.\n\nThe court has set a briefing schedule. Defendants will file their motion to dismiss by August 8, 2025. Plaintiffs' response brief in opposition to that motion will be due September 12, and defendants' reply will be due September 26. The court will rule on the motion to dismiss after that date.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 2, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by several disability rights organizations (including groups representing people with disabilities, the blind, the deaf, and seniors) and seven individual plaintiffs who are disabled older adults and individuals. The plaintiffs sued the Social Security Administration (SSA), its Acting Commissioner, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), its Acting Administrator, and Elon Musk in his official capacity as the de facto head of DOGE. The plaintiffs are represented by private law firms and legal services organizations.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from recent administrative reforms at the SSA, initiated by its Acting Commissioner under the direction of DOGE. These reforms included the elimination of two key SSA offices: the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO), responsible for discrimination complaints and reasonable accommodation requests, and the Office of Transformation (OT), tasked with modernizing customer service and digital infrastructure. Additionally, the SSA announced a plan to reduce its workforce by 7,000 employees, consolidate regional offices, and initially implement new identity verification policies that would increase the need for in-person visits to field offices. The plaintiffs allege these actions constitute an \"unprecedented and unconstitutional assault\" on Social Security benefits, severely undermining the agency's public-facing services and causing significant delays in application processing, hindering access to critical accommodations, and dismantling civil rights protections. They contend these changes disproportionately harm people with disabilities and older adults who rely on SSA for essential benefits.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims alleging violations of Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)), which prohibits disability-based discrimination; the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause; the First Amendment's Right to Petition the Government; and multiple provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702\u201306). Under the APA, they specifically alleged unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency action, arbitrary and capricious agency action, action not in accordance with law (including violations of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution), and action in excess of statutory authority.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, specifically requesting a preliminary and permanent injunction to halt the alleged unlawful actions. The requested injunction aimed to prevent further dismantling of OCREO and OT, stop the termination and require the rehiring of the 7,000 staff, enjoin the closure of SSA offices, and reverse new policies requiring in-person identity verification. They also sought reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta. On April 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs' motion were filed by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Medicare Rights Center on April 10, 2025, and by the States of Connecticut and twenty other states and the District of Columbia on April 15, 2025. Defendants filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 16, 2025, arguing, among other things, that plaintiffs lacked standing and that federal personnel statutes precluded judicial review of employment-related claims, citing *OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904, 2025 WL 1035208 (S. Ct. Apr. 8, 2025)*. Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion on April 21, 2025.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Judge Mehta issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to meet the \"high standard\" of establishing irreparable harm, noting that individual plaintiffs largely complained about issues predating the challenged administrative actions or failed to demonstrate a \"certain and great\" near-term life-or-death consequence. Similarly, organizational plaintiffs did not provide sufficient specifics to show a \"perceptible impairment\" of their programs or a \"direct conflict\" with their mission.\n\nSubsequently, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint. However, on July 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint. As a result, on July 8, 2025, Judge Mehta denied the defendants' Motion to Dismiss as moot, without prejudice, due to the filing of the amended complaint. A suggestion of death was filed on June 11, 2025, for plaintiff Treva Olivero."

            "summary_A": "This case challenged Executive Order 14248, which imposed various requirements on federal elections. On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its director and commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense as Defendants. They challenged multiple sections of Executive Order 14248, titled \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" signed on March 25, 2025. These sections:\n\n\u2022 Require the EAC to demand documentary proof of citizenship and to record such information,   \u2022 Require the heads of federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing registration forms,   \u2022 Order the Secretary of Defense to require proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application,   \u2022 Command the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, and   \u2022 Condition federal funding upon compliance with the EO.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Represented by their respective attorneys general, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Denise J. Casper.\n\nOn April 23, the defendants moved to transfer and consolidate this case with a case in the District Court for the District of Columbia, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President [../../../../case/46322/], which also challenged the EO. Judge Casper denied the motion on May 9, finding that transfer was not in the interests of justice in this case, given that the plaintiffs here were states, not private parties, and this case challenged different sections of the EO from those challenged in the D.D.C. case.\n\nOn May 5, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the motion on June 13, finding that the challenged sections were ripe for review since they either imposed deadlines or clearly laid out actions that the defendants were required to take. Turning to the merits, the court found that the President lacked the authority to take the actions challenged, since in federal statutes such as the NVRA, the HAVA, and the UOCAVA, Congress set requirements for federal elections that did not include those required by the EO. Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\u00a0Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248\u2019s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states, represented by their respective Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the President of the United States and various federal officials and agencies, including the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC).\n\nThe lawsuit challenges Executive Order No. 14248, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" which was issued on March 25, 2025. The states alleged that the executive order unconstitutionally usurped the authority over federal elections reserved to the states and Congress by the U.S. Constitution's Elections and Electors Clauses. The states argued that the President's actions were *ultra vires* (beyond his legal authority) and violated the separation of powers. The complaint further asserted that the order conflicted with federal statutes, including the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The states sought a declaratory judgment that specific provisions of the order were unlawful and an injunction to prevent their implementation.\n\nThe challenged provisions of the executive order sought to:\n*   Require the EAC to add a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement to the national mail voter registration form.\n*   Require the Secretary of Defense to add a similar requirement to the registration form for military and overseas voters.\n*   Command state-designated public assistance agencies to assess an individual's citizenship before providing a voter registration form.\n*   Direct the Attorney General to take enforcement action against states whose laws permit counting mail-in ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but received afterward.\n*   Condition federal election funding on states' compliance with a strict Election Day ballot-receipt deadline.\n\nThe states filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of these provisions. On June 13, 2025, Judge Denise J. Casper granted the motion, referencing a related case brought by private parties, *League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Exec. Off. of the President*, 2025 WL 1187730. Judge Casper found that the states were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the President lacked the constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally alter federal election procedures, direct the actions of an independent agency like the EAC, or impose new conditions on congressionally appropriated funds. The court concluded that the states would suffer irreparable harm from the costs of compliance, the diversion of resources, and the potential disenfranchisement of eligible voters.\n\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction on June 13, 2025, which was later modified by an amended order on July 18, 2025. The injunction prohibits the federal officials from implementing the challenged provisions of the executive order, including barring civil or criminal enforcement actions against the thirteen plaintiff states with laws allowing for the counting of ballots received after Election Day.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the federal officials filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit."

            "summary_A": "This case challenges the Trump Administration\u2019s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief\u2014such as reinstating grants\u2014remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that OJP\u2019s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit\u2019s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA\u2019s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate\u2019s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants\u2019 actions were \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants\u2019 abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as \u201cunquestionably arbitrary,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201cunfair and indiscriminate.\u201d plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court\u2019s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants\u2019 actions \u201carbitrary, at least in lay terms\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was \u201cfar from obvious\u201d and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d emphasizing that this was not a \u201crare\u201d case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not \u201cso grave\u201d as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

The affected grants supported a wide range of public safety initiatives, including community violence intervention, support for crime victims, youth and juvenile justice programs, and services for vulnerable populations such as the Deaf, disabled, and victims of hate crimes. The terminations were executed without prior notice, using identical form emails stating only that the awards \u201cno longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities,\u201d citing a change in agency priorities.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, a group of non-profit organizations\u2014Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, and Health Resources in Action\u2014filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation and Perry Law.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that OJP\u2019s mass terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706), the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause (procedural due process and void-for-vagueness), and constitutional principles including the Appropriations Clause, Spending Clause, Take Care Clause, and separation of powers. They also brought an equitable ultra vires claim. The plaintiffs argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the awards, which, under federal regulations, could not be terminated solely for a post-award change in agency priorities unless such a basis was clearly stated in the award documents. The remedies sought included declaratory and injunctive relief to reverse the terminations, reinstate funding, and prohibit OJP from re-obligating the terminated funds.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta. Plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and class certification. Multiple states and local governments filed amicus briefs supporting the plaintiffs, emphasizing the public safety impact of the funding cuts.\n\nOJP and the Department of Justice, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division, opposed the motions and moved to dismiss, arguing that the claims were essentially contractual and thus fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act. They further contended that the plaintiffs failed to state any claim for which relief could be granted under the Constitution or the APA.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, Judge Mehta issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the preliminary injunction, granting the motion to dismiss, and denying the motion for class certification as moot. The court found that, while OJP\u2019s actions were \u201cunquestionably arbitrary\u201d and \u201cshameful,\u201d it lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because they were fundamentally contractual and thus subject to the Tucker Act\u2019s jurisdictional bar, as clarified by recent Supreme Court precedent (Dep\u2019t of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025)). The court also held that the plaintiffs failed to state a plausible due process claim because they did not have a constitutionally protected property interest in continued grant funding, and dismissed the separation of powers and ultra vires claims for failure to plausibly allege a violation or for lack of a specific statutory prohibition.\n\nFollowing dismissal, the plaintiffs moved for an injunction pending appeal. The court denied the request for affirmative reinstatement of funding but entered a limited injunction prohibiting OJP from re-obligating or diminishing the sums awarded under the five named plaintiffs\u2019 terminated grants pending appellate review, and required the parties to update the court on the status of appellate proceedings.\n\nAs of the latest docket entries, the case is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, with plaintiffs seeking emergency relief to prevent irreparable harm to their operations and the communities they serve due to the loss of federal funding."

            "summary_A": "This is a case about the federal government's alleged retaliation against labor unions for opposing President Trump\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, several labor unions, representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees nationwide, including veterans' healthcare workers, defense personnel, and regulatory staff, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald Trump, multiple federal agencies, and their heads. The plaintiffs, including AFGE, AFSCME, NNOC/NNU, SEIU, NAGE, and NFFE, challenged Executive Order 14180, titled \u201cExclusions from Federal Labor-Management Programs,\u201d signed on March 27, 2025, alleging that it unlawfully retaliated against their protected speech in support of civil servants and violated the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Separation of Powers Doctrine. They also alleged statutory overreach under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(b) of the Civil Service Reform Act, claiming the order targeted them for engaging in protected activity such as litigation, public criticism, and union advocacy. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, vacatur of the order, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Judge James Donato was assigned to the case\n\nThe Exclusion Order targeted nearly 40 federal departments and sub-agencies\u2014including the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services\u2014citing national security grounds. However, the complaint alleged that the order was pretextual and driven by political animus, referencing the administration\u2019s rhetoric and social media statements attacking \u201chostile unions\u201d and \u201cgrievance filers.\u201d The order also uniquely authorized only a few departments, such as DOD and VA, to restore bargaining rights to specific subdivisions, leaving thousands of workers' rights in limbo.\n\nIn parallel, the Trump administration filed a related lawsuit in Waco, Texas, seeking to nullify collective bargaining agreements with local union affiliates, underscoring a coordinated legal strategy. Plaintiffs in the California case argued that these actions reflected a broader campaign to dismantle the statutory framework protecting federal labor-management relations established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause, accompanied by 50 supporting declarations from affected workers. On April 25, the government filed its opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the March 27 Executive Order was a lawful exercise of presidential authority in the interest of national security. In response, the court ordered both parties to submit by May 2 a joint statement identifying any other pending lawsuits challenging the Executive Order and to address potential coordination under local rules.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1755442. The court rejected the government\u2019s argument that Congress had precluded judicial review by providing administrative review through the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). It explained that the FLRA has authority \u201cover those disputes which arise under Chapter 71,\u201d but the Executive Order \u201cexpressly removed the employees of the listed departments, agencies, and subdivisions from Chapter 71\u2019s coverage.\u201d As a result, the court concluded it was \u201cnot precluded from exercising jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their First Amendment retaliation claim, noting they engaged in protected activity by \u201cfrequently speak[ing] against actions undertaken by President Trump and his administration since January 2025.\u201d It concluded the government\u2019s conduct would \u201cchill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in protected activity\u201d and that the evidence raised \u201ca serious question whether the agency exclusions in EO 14251 constitute retaliation for protected speech.\u201d Thus, the court held the plaintiffs had shown a serious First Amendment issue warranting preservation of the status quo pending further litigation. As such, the court declined to address the plaintiffs\u2019 other arguments and enjoined the implementation of Section 2 of the EO. It also required the plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking both an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The government also sought a stay from Judge Donato, which was denied. On July 7, the Ninth Circuit granted the government\u2019s administrative stay pending the appeal, without providing an explanation.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the government's motion for a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 2180674. The court found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that even if the unions could show a prima facie case of retaliation, the President would have issued the order regardless of the unions' protected speech due to national security concerns. The court also found that the government would suffer irreparable harm without a stay, as an injunction would \"tie the government's hands\" in a national security context. Regarding the harm to other parties, the court found that any injury to the unions would be mitigated, as terminated collective bargaining agreements could be reinstated and a pause in dues collection could be managed by voluntary payments and future monetary damages. Finally, the court determined that a stay would serve the public interest by \"preserving the President's autonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise.\"\n\nThis case remains ongoing in the district court and Ninth Circuit.",
            "summary_B": "On April 3, 2025, a coalition of six federal employee unions, represented by private counsel and in-house attorneys, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, numerous federal agencies, and their respective heads in their official capacities. The suit challenges a March 27, 2025 Executive Order that, citing national security, excluded a large number of federal agencies and their employees from the collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (codified at 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71).\n\nThe unions alleged that the Executive Order was not a legitimate exercise of presidential authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(b)(1) but was instead unlawful retaliation for their constitutionally protected speech, including filing lawsuits and publicly criticizing the administration's agenda. They pointed to a White House Fact Sheet issued with the order that referenced \"hostile Federal unions\" who had \"declared war on President Trump's agenda.\" The complaint asserts that the order is *ultra vires* (exceeding statutory authority) and violates the First and Fifth Amendments. The unions sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the implementation of the order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge James Donato of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On April 7, 2025, the unions filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which the court treated as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining the administration from implementing or enforcing the core provisions of the Executive Order against the unions and their members. In his opinion (2025 WL 1755442), the judge found that the unions had raised \"serious questions\" on the merits of their First Amendment retaliation claim, citing the White House Fact Sheet and the unprecedented scope of the order. The court also found a likelihood of irreparable harm to the unions, including the potential collapse of their finances and operations.\n\nThe administration appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and sought an emergency stay of the injunction pending the appeal. On August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the stay. The appellate court concluded that the administration was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the Executive Order and Fact Sheet provided a sufficient non-retaliatory basis related to national security and that the President would have likely taken the same action absent the unions' protected speech. As a result, the district court's preliminary injunction is not currently in effect while the appeal proceeds."

            "summary_A": "In this case, two organizations involved in research about education policies, practices, and methods sued the Department of Education and its Secretary. The plaintiffs challenged actions taken by the Department regarding the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) and its centers. Under the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), the Department, through IES, is charged with conducting, assessing, collecting, and disseminating research about education practices and policies in the U.S. \"Through IES and its Centers, Congress sought to improve both the quantity and quality of educational data collection.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14,242, titled \"Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities.\" In this order, President Trump instructed the Secretary \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, [to] take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\" In keeping with this directive, the Department canceled most of IES's contracts with independent contractors that it used to collect, analyze, and publish educational data. On March 11, the Department also announced a Reduction in Force of nearly 50% of its workforce.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the plaintiffs filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions \"will limit the availability and access of significant datasets that are needed to identify, investigate, evaluate, and improve educational outcomes.\" Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions would prevent the IES from carrying out its instructions from Congress to collect and disseminate educational data. Therefore, the plaintiffs argued that the defendant's actions exceeded statutory authority, were not in accordance with law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs also claimed the actions violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles and exceeded the agency's statutory authority under ERSA. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the defendants had violated the APA, to enjoin the defendants from refusing to fulfill contracts or destroying any datasets in existence, and to order the defendants to reinstate cancelled contracts and a sufficient workforce to carry out the IES's duties.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Trevor N. McFadden. On May 2, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, telling the court that any delay in granting relief would cause them irreparable harm, given the President's directives to the Department. On May 5, the defendants moved for a stay. The defendants pointed to another related case that was also assigned to Judge McFadden, Association for Education Finance and Policy v. McMahon, [../../../../case/46342/] arguing that since the plaintiffs in both cases had moved for preliminary injunctions seeking identical relief, the court here should stay the proceedings until a decision was reached in the other case on the preliminary injunction. On May 6, Judge McFadden denied the defendants' motion for a stay. Judge McFadden said that the defendants had only argued that they would suffer hardship from having to litigate two similar cases at the same time, which does not warrant a stay. Furthermore, the judge said that comity concerns do not exist in this case, since both matters were before the same court, rather than before courts in different jurisdictions.\n\nOn May 19, the judge held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion on June 3, finding that the plaintiffs were \"seeking wholesale correction of general agency operations and bundling together claims to pursue outsized relief.\" Rather than bringing a claim against a discrete agency action as required by the APA, the plaintiffs were challenging a programmatic decision, the reduction of workforce and services by the Department. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs were not bringing a justiciable claim under the APA, dooming their request for a preliminary injunction based on the APA.\n\nTurning to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, the court also found them deficient, stating that \"if every statutory compliance issue triggered separation of powers concerns, virtually all APA cases would balloon into disputes of constitutional proportions.\" Instead, the plaintiffs' constitutional claims in this case were simply statutory violation claims in disguise. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim for relief under the Constitution. Given these deficiencies, the court said the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits of their claims and denied their request for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1568301.\n\nThe plaintiffs next filed an amended complaint on July 21. The amended compliant removed many of the general allegations of illegal activity by the defendants, instead focusing on ten specific studies and datasets used by the plaintiffs. The amended complaint focused on these ten datasets, their purposes, their use by the plaintiffs, and how their use had been hindered by the defendants' actions. The plaintiffs' claims for relief follow this updated structure, arguing that the defendants' actions in ceasing to provide access to these datasets were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Finally, the amended complaint also restructures the relief sought, seeking specific injunctions for each of the datasets.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",
            "summary_B": "On April 24, 2025, two non-profit educational research organizations, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and its Secretary. The suit challenges the administration's actions to dismantle the Department's research arm, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). The organizations alleged that the Department had cancelled over $900 million in essential research contracts, implemented a Reduction in Force that eliminated approximately 90% of IES staff, and restricted researchers' access to critical educational data.\n\nThe organizations claimed these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because they were arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded the Department's authority under the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), which statutorily mandates the data collection and dissemination work of IES. They also brought a claim for violation of the constitutional Separation of Powers doctrine. The organizations sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the Department to reinstate the contracts and staff, restore data access, and cease its efforts to incapacitate the IES.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The organizations filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the Department's actions while the case proceeded. The Department opposed the motion, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that its decisions regarding staffing and funding were committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge McFadden issued a memorandum opinion denying the preliminary injunction. The judge ruled that the organizations were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims because their lawsuit constituted an improper \"programmatic challenge\" under the APA. He explained that the APA allows for challenges to discrete, final agency actions but not for wholesale judicial oversight of an agency's day-to-day operations or multifaceted transformations. The court found that the organizations had bundled together numerous grievances\u2014contract cancellations, personnel reductions, and data access changes\u2014to challenge the overall \"dismantling\" of the IES, which is not a single, reviewable agency action. The constitutional claim was also dismissed as a repackaging of the failed statutory claims. This opinion was issued jointly with a related case, *Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. v. McMahon*, Case No. 1:25-cv-00999.\n\nFollowing the denial of their motion, the organizations filed a First Amended Complaint on July 21, 2025, and the court has set a briefing schedule for the Department's anticipated motion to dismiss."
