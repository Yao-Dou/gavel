You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from legal case documents. You will be given a document chunk from a legal case. Your task is to {item_description}

# Note: 
- Do not make assumptions or add information that is not presented in the document chunk.
- When extracting evidence, quote the exact text from the document chunk.
- You are processing documents chunk by chunk. Build upon the current state provided below.
- If no new relevant information is found in this chunk, return the current state unchanged.
- Each extracted value must be self-contained and easy to understand; include important context when available.

# Current State
This is the accumulated extraction state from previous chunks:
{current_state}

# Document Information
- Document Name: {document_name}
- Chunk: {chunk_id}/{total_chunks}

# Document Chunk
{document_chunk}

# Output Format
Your output should be in the following JSON format—no extra keys, no prose outside of the JSON:

```
{{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis of this document chunk and how you identified any new relevant information or determined that none was present>",
  "extracted": [
    {{
      "evidence": [
        {{
          "text": "<verbatim snippet 1>",
          "source_document": "<document name>",
          "location": "Chunk {chunk_id}/{total_chunks}"
        }},
        {{
          "text": "<verbatim snippet 2 (if multiple snippets are relevant)>",
          "source_document": "<document name>",
          "location": "Chunk {chunk_id}/{total_chunks}"
        }}
        // ...
      ],
      "value": "<extracted information from the evidence>"
    }}
    // ...
  ]
}}
```

## Definitions of each part
- `reasoning`: A brief analysis of this document chunk and how you identified any new relevant information or determined that none was present.
- `extracted`: A list of one or more objects, each representing a distinct piece of information relevant to the checklist item. Always use a list, even if there is only one item. This should include both existing items from the current state and any new items found in this chunk.
- `evidence`: A list of evidence objects, each containing:
  - `text`: Exact text snippet copied from the document chunk
  - `source_document`: The title/name of the document where this evidence was found
  - `location`: The chunk identifier in format "Chunk {chunk_id}/{total_chunks}" where the evidence appears
- `value`: The extracted information based on the evidence.

## Rules for the JSON schema
1. **extracted** and **evidence** are always lists, even if they hold a single object.
2. Copy the **text** in evidence objects exactly as it appears in the document chunk—no rewriting or paraphrasing.
3. Always include **source_document** and **location** for each piece of evidence.
4. If the document chunk contains no new relevant information, return the current state's **extracted** list unchanged:

```
{{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis>",
  "extracted": <current_state_extracted_list>
}}
```

5. Merge new information with the current state—do not duplicate existing extractions.
6. Each distinct piece of information should be a separate item in the **extracted** list.
7. For any new evidence found in the current chunk, always use "Chunk {chunk_id}/{total_chunks}" as the location. When carrying forward existing evidence from the current state, preserve their original location values unchanged.
8. When the current state is empty (i.e., this is the first chunk), start fresh with any relevant information found.
