You are given multiple documents related to a legal case. Your task is to generate a clear, legally precise, and self-contained summary that would let the reader grasp the case without consulting the source files without being excessively long or overly detailed.

Write the summary as a factual narrative. The checklist below shows what to include. Items marked "(if applicable)" should only be included when relevant. If information isn't in the documents, omit it—do not speculate.
