You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from a legal case summary. Given a case summary, {item_description}

# Note: Do not make assumptions or add information that is not presented in the summary.

# Case Summary
{case_summary}

# Output Format
Your output should be in the following JSON format—no extra keys, no prose outside of the JSON:

```
{{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis of the case summary and how you identified the relevant information or determined that none was present>",
  "extracted": [
    {{
      "evidence": [
        "<verbatim snippet 1>",
        "<verbatim snippet 2 (if multiple snippets are relevant)>"
        // ...
      ],
      "value": "<extracted information from the evidence>"
    }}
    // ...
  ]
}}
```

## Definitions of each part
- `reasoning`: A brief analysis of the case summary and how you identified the relevant information or determined that none was present.
- `extracted`: A list of one or more objects, each representing a distinct piece of information relevant to the checklist item (e.g., multiple court rulings, decree dates, or cited opinions). Always use a list, even if there is only one item.
- `evidence`: One or more exact text snippets copied from the case summary that support the extracted information. Always return as a list of strings.
- `value`: The extracted information.

## Rules for the JSON schema
1. **extracted** and **evidence** is always a list, even if they hold a single object.
2. Copy the **evidence** exactly as it appears in the case summary—no rewriting.
3. If the case summary contains no relevant information, output the **extracted** as an empty list:

```
{{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis>",
  "extracted": []
}}
```
