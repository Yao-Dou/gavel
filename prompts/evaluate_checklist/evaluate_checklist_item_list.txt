You are given two lists of legal information (A and B) about **{checklist_category}**, extracted from two summaries of the same legal case. Your task is to compare these lists based on their **semantic meaning**—that is, what each item conveys, regardless of wording, format, or phrasing.

You should identify:
1. Items that appear in **both A and B** (i.e., semantically equivalent),
2. Items that appear **only in A**,
3. Items that appear **only in B**.

# Information to Compare
## List A:
{information_A}

## List B:
{information_B}

# Output Format
Structure your response as follows:
**Reasoning:**
Provide your detailed analysis of how the two lists relate to each other. Explain any mappings between items, and how you determined whether they were equivalent or different.

**Final Answer:**
Output a valid JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "common": [
    {{"A_index": X, "B_index": Y}},
    ...
  ],
  "only_in_A": [X, ...],
  "only_in_B": [Y, ...]
}}
```

Where:
- `A_index` is the index of the item in List A,
- `B_index` is the index of the semantically equivalent item in List B,
- `only_in_A` lists the indices of items in A that do **not** appear in B,
- `only_in_B` lists the indices of items in B that do **not** appear in A.

# Notes
- Both List A and B are numbered using 1-based indexing.
- Match items even if they are paraphrased or formatted differently.
- Treat legal synonyms and abbreviations as equivalent when appropriate.
- Return only valid JSON in the **Final Answer** section.
